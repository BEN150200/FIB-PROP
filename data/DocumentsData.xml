G. Wells [1898]     But who shall dwell in these worlds if they be     inhabited? .  .  .  Are we or they Lords of the     World? .  .  .  And how are all things made for man?--          KEPLER (quoted in The Anatomy of Melancholy)BOOK ONETHE COMING OF THE MARTIANSCHAPTER ONETHE EVE OF THE WARNo one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenthcentury that this world was being watched keenly and closely byintelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; that asmen busied themselves about their various concerns they werescrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with amicroscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm andmultiply in a drop of water.  With infinite complacency men went toand fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in theirassurance of their empire over matter.  It is possible that theinfusoria under the microscope do the same.  No one gave a thought tothe older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought ofthem only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible orimprobable.  It is curious to recall some of the mental habits ofthose departed days.  At most terrestrial men fancied there might beother men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready towelcome a missionary enterprise.  Yet across the gulf of space, mindsthat are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish,intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth withenvious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.  Andearly in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment.The planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about thesun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat itreceives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world.It must be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than ourworld; and long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon itssurface must have begun its course.  The fact that it is scarcely oneseventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its coolingto the temperature at which life could begin.  It has air and waterand all that is necessary for the support of animated existence.Yet so vain is man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no writer,up to the very end of the nineteenth century, expressed any idea thatintelligent life might have developed there far, or indeed at all,beyond its earthly level.  Nor was it generally understood that sinceMars is older than our earth, with scarcely a quarter of thesuperficial area and remoter from the sun, it necessarily follows thatit is not only more distant from time's beginning but nearer its end.The secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet hasalready gone far indeed with our neighbour.  Its physical condition isstill largely a mystery, but we know now that even in its equatorialregion the midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldestwinter.  Its air is much more attenuated than ours, its oceans haveshrunk until they cover but a third of its surface, and as its slowseasons change huge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole andperiodically inundate its temperate zones.  That last stage ofexhaustion, which to us is still incredibly remote, has become apresent-day problem for the inhabitants of Mars.  The immediatepressure of necessity has brightened their intellects, enlarged theirpowers, and hardened their hearts.  And looking across space withinstruments, and intelligences such as we have scarcely dreamed of,they see, at its nearest distance only 35,000,000 of miles sunward ofthem, a morning star of hope, our own warmer planet, green withvegetation and grey with water, with a cloudy atmosphere eloquent offertility, with glimpses through its drifting cloud wisps of broadstretches of populous country and narrow, navy-crowded seas.And we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to themat least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us.  Theintellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessantstruggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is the beliefof the minds upon Mars.  Their world is far gone in its cooling andthis world is still crowded with life, but crowded only with what theyregard as inferior animals.  To carry warfare sunward is, indeed,their only escape from the destruction that, generation aftergeneration, creeps upon them.And before we judge of them too harshly we must remember whatruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not onlyupon animals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon itsinferior races.  The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness,were entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination wagedby European immigrants, in the space of fifty years.  Are we suchapostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the samespirit?The Martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazingsubtlety--their mathematical learning is evidently far in excess ofours--and to have carried out their preparations with a well-nighperfect unanimity.  Had our instruments permitted it, we might haveseen the gathering trouble far back in the nineteenth century.  Menlike Schiaparelli watched the red planet--it is odd, by-the-bye, thatfor countless centuries Mars has been the star of war--but failed tointerpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped sowell.  All that time the Martians must have been getting ready.During the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen on theilluminated part of the disk, first at the Lick Observatory, then byPerrotin of Nice, and then by other observers.  English readers heardof it first in the issue of _Nature_ dated August 2.  I am inclined tothink that this blaze may have been the casting of the huge gun, inthe vast pit sunk into their planet, from which their shots were firedat us.  Peculiar markings, as yet unexplained, were seen near the siteof that outbreak during the next two oppositions.The storm burst upon us six years ago now.  As Mars approachedopposition, Lavelle of Java set the wires of the astronomical exchangepalpitating with the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak ofincandescent gas upon the planet.  It had occurred towards midnight ofthe twelfth; and the spectroscope, to which he had at once resorted,indicated a mass of flaming gas, chiefly hydrogen, moving with anenormous velocity towards this earth.  This jet of fire had becomeinvisible about a quarter past twelve.  He compared it to a colossalpuff of flame suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet, &quot;asflaming gases rushed out of a gun.&quot;A singularly appropriate phrase it proved.  Yet the next day therewas nothing of this in the papers except a little note in the _DailyTelegraph_, and the world went in ignorance of one of the gravestdangers that ever threatened the human race. I might not have heard ofthe eruption at all had I not met Ogilvy, the well-known astronomer,at Ottershaw.  He was immensely excited at the news, and in the excessof his feelings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in ascrutiny of the red planet.In spite of all that has happened since, I still remember thatvigil very distinctly: the black and silent observatory, the shadowedlantern throwing a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner, thesteady ticking of the clockwork of the telescope, the little slit inthe roof--an oblong profundity with the stardust streaked across it.Ogilvy moved about, invisible but audible.  Looking through thetelescope, one saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planetswimming in the field.  It seemed such a little thing, so bright andsmall and still, faintly marked with transverse stripes, and slightlyflattened from the perfect round.  But so little it was, so silverywarm--a pin's-head of light! It was as if it quivered, but really thiswas the telescope vibrating with the activity of the clockwork thatkept the planet in view.As I watched, the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and toadvance and recede, but that was simply that my eye was tired.  Fortymillions of miles it was from us--more than forty millions of miles ofvoid.  Few people realise the immensity of vacancy in which the dustof the material universe swims.Near it in the field, I remember, were three faint points of light,three telescopic stars infinitely remote, and all around it was theunfathomable darkness of empty space.  You know how that blacknesslooks on a frosty starlight night.  In a telescope it seems farprofounder.  And invisible to me because it was so remote and small,flying swiftly and steadily towards me across that incredibledistance, drawing nearer every minute by so many thousands of miles,came the Thing they were sending us, the Thing that was to bring somuch struggle and calamity and death to the earth.  I never dreamed ofit then as I watched; no one on earth dreamed of that unerringmissile.That night, too, there was another jetting out of gas from thedistant planet.  I saw it.  A reddish flash at the edge, the slightestprojection of the outline just as the chronometer struck midnight; andat that I told Ogilvy and he took my place.  The night was warm and Iwas thirsty, and I went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my wayin the darkness, to the little table where the siphon stood, whileOgilvy exclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us.That night another invisible missile started on its way to theearth from Mars, just a second or so under twenty-four hours after thefirst one.  I remember how I sat on the table there in the blackness,with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes.  I wished Ihad a light to smoke by, little suspecting the meaning of the minutegleam I had seen and all that it would presently bring me.  Ogilvywatched till one, and then gave it up; and we lit the lantern andwalked over to his house.  Down below in the darkness were Ottershawand Chertsey and all their hundreds of people, sleeping in peace.He was full of speculation that night about the condition of Mars,and scoffed at the vulgar idea of its having inhabitants who weresignalling us.  His idea was that meteorites might be falling in aheavy shower upon the planet, or that a huge volcanic explosion was inprogress.  He pointed out to me how unlikely it was that organicevolution had taken the same direction in the two adjacent planets.&quot;The chances against anything manlike on Mars are a million toone,&quot; he said.Hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night afterabout midnight, and again the night after; and so for ten nights, aflame each night.  Why the shots ceased after the tenth no one onearth has attempted to explain.  It may be the gases of the firingcaused the Martians inconvenience.  Dense clouds of smoke or dust,visible through a powerful telescope on earth as little grey,fluctuating patches, spread through the clearness of the planet'satmosphere and obscured its more familiar features.Even the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at last, andpopular notes appeared here, there, and everywhere concerning thevolcanoes upon Mars.  The seriocomic periodical _Punch_, I remember,made a happy use of it in the political cartoon.  And, allunsuspected, those missiles the Martians had fired at us drewearthward, rushing now at a pace of many miles a second through theempty gulf of space, hour by hour and day by day, nearer and nearer.It seems to me now almost incredibly wonderful that, with that swiftfate hanging over us, men could go about their petty concerns as theydid.  I remember how jubilant Markham was at securing a new photographof the planet for the illustrated paper he edited in those days.People in these latter times scarcely realise the abundance andenterprise of our nineteenth-century papers.  For my own part, I wasmuch occupied in learning to ride the bicycle, and busy upon a seriesof papers discussing the probable developments of moral ideas ascivilisation progressed.One night (the first missile then could scarcely have been10,000,000 miles away) I went for a walk with my wife.  It wasstarlight and I explained the Signs of the Zodiac to her, and pointedout Mars, a bright dot of light creeping zenithward, towards which somany telescopes were pointed.  It was a warm night.  Coming home, aparty of excursionists from Chertsey or Isleworth passed us singingand playing music.  There were lights in the upper windows of thehouses as the people went to bed.  From the railway station in thedistance came the sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling,softened almost into melody by the distance.  My wife pointed out tome the brightness of the red, green, and yellow signal lights hangingin a framework against the sky.  It seemed so safe and tranquil.CHAPTER TWOTHE FALLING STARThen came the night of the first falling star.  It was seen earlyin the morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame highin the atmosphere.  Hundreds must have seen it, and taken it for anordinary falling star.  Albin described it as leaving a greenishstreak behind it that glowed for some seconds.  Denning, our greatestauthority on meteorites, stated that the height of its firstappearance was about ninety or one hundred miles.  It seemed to himthat it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him.I was at home at that hour and writing in my study; and although myFrench windows face towards Ottershaw and the blind was up (for Iloved in those days to look up at the night sky), I saw nothing of it.Yet this strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outerspace must have fallen while I was sitting there, visible to me had Ionly looked up as it passed.  Some of those who saw its flight say ittravelled with a hissing sound.  I myself heard nothing of that.  Manypeople in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the fall ofit, and, at most, have thought that another meteorite had descended.No one seems to have troubled to look for the fallen mass that night.But very early in the morning poor Ogilvy, who had seen theshooting star and who was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere onthe common between Horsell, Ottershaw, and Woking, rose early with theidea of finding it.  Find it he did, soon after dawn, and not far fromthe sand pits.  An enormous hole had been made by the impact of theprojectile, and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in everydirection over the heath, forming heaps visible a mile and a halfaway.  The heather was on fire eastward, and a thin blue smoke roseagainst the dawn.The Thing itself lay almost entirely buried in sand, amidst thescattered splinters of a fir tree it had shivered to fragments in itsdescent.  The uncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder,caked over and its outline softened by a thick scaly dun-colouredincrustation.  It had a diameter of about thirty yards.  He approachedthe mass, surprised at the size and more so at the shape, since mostmeteorites are rounded more or less completely.  It was, however,still so hot from its flight through the air as to forbid his nearapproach.  A stirring noise within its cylinder he ascribed to theunequal cooling of its surface; for at that time it had not occurredto him that it might be hollow.He remained standing at the edge of the pit that the Thing had madefor itself, staring at its strange appearance, astonished chiefly atits unusual shape and colour, and dimly perceiving even then someevidence of design in its arrival.  The early morning was wonderfullystill, and the sun, just clearing the pine trees towards Weybridge,was already warm.  He did not remember hearing any birds that morning,there was certainly no breeze stirring, and the only sounds were thefaint movements from within the cindery cylinder.  He was all alone onthe common.Then suddenly he noticed with a start that some of the greyclinker, the ashy incrustation that covered the meteorite, was fallingoff the circular edge of the end.  It was dropping off in flakes andraining down upon the sand.  A large piece suddenly came off and fellwith a sharp noise that brought his heart into his mouth.For a minute he scarcely realised what this meant, and, althoughthe heat was excessive, he clambered down into the pit close to thebulk to see the Thing more clearly.  He fancied even then that thecooling of the body might account for this, but what disturbed thatidea was the fact that the ash was falling only from the end of thecylinder.And then he perceived that, very slowly, the circular top of thecylinder was rotating on its body.  It was such a gradual movementthat he discovered it only through noticing that a black mark that hadbeen near him five minutes ago was now at the other side of thecircumference.  Even then he scarcely understood what this indicated,until he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerkforward an inch or so.  Then the thing came upon him in a flash.  Thecylinder was artificial--hollow--with an end that screwed out!Something within the cylinder was unscrewing the top!&quot;Good heavens!&quot; said Ogilvy.  &quot;There's a man in it--men in it! Halfroasted to death!  Trying to escape!&quot;At once, with a quick mental leap, he linked the Thing with theflash upon Mars.The thought of the confined creature was so dreadful to him that heforgot the heat and went forward to the cylinder to help turn.  Butluckily the dull radiation arrested him before he could burn his handson the still-glowing metal.  At that he stood irresolute for a moment,then turned, scrambled out of the pit, and set off running wildly intoWoking.  The time then must have been somewhere about six o'clock.He met a waggoner and tried to make him understand, but the tale hetold and his appearance were so wild--his hat had fallen off in thepit--that the man simply drove on.  He was equally unsuccessful with thepotman who was just unlocking the doors of the public-house by HorsellBridge.  The fellow thought he was a lunatic at large and made anunsuccessful attempt to shut him into the taproom.  That sobered him alittle; and when he saw Henderson, the London journalist, in hisgarden, he called over the palings and made himself understood.&quot;Henderson,&quot; he called, &quot;you saw that shooting star last night?&quot;&quot;Well?&quot; said Henderson.&quot;It's out on Horsell Common now.&quot;&quot;Good Lord!&quot; said Henderson.  &quot;Fallen meteorite!  That's good.&quot;&quot;But it's something more than a meteorite.  It's a cylinder--anartificial cylinder, man!  And there's something inside.&quot;Henderson stood up with his spade in his hand.&quot;What's that?&quot; he said.  He was deaf in one ear.Ogilvy told him all that he had seen.  Henderson was a minute or sotaking it in.  Then he dropped his spade, snatched up his jacket, andcame out into the road.  The two men hurried back at once to thecommon, and found the cylinder still lying in the same position.  Butnow the sounds inside had ceased, and a thin circle of bright metalshowed between the top and the body of the cylinder.  Air was eitherentering or escaping at the rim with a thin, sizzling sound.They listened, rapped on the scaly burnt metal with a stick, and,meeting with no response, they both concluded the man or men insidemust be insensible or dead.Of course the two were quite unable to do anything.  They shoutedconsolation and promises, and went off back to the town again to gethelp.  One can imagine them, covered with sand, excited anddisordered, running up the little street in the bright sunlight justas the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people wereopening their bedroom windows.  Henderson went into the railwaystation at once, in order to telegraph the news to London.  Thenewspaper articles had prepared men's minds for the reception of theidea.By eight o'clock a number of boys and unemployed men had alreadystarted for the common to see the &quot;dead men from Mars.&quot;  That was theform the story took.  I heard of it first from my newspaper boy abouta quarter to nine when I went out to get my _Daily Chronicle_.  I wasnaturally startled, and lost no time in going out and across theOttershaw bridge to the sand pits.CHAPTER THREEON HORSELL COMMONI found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people surrounding thehuge hole in which the cylinder lay.  I have already described theappearance of that colossal bulk, embedded in the ground.  The turfand gravel about it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion.  Nodoubt its impact had caused a flash of fire.  Henderson and Ogilvywere not there.  I think they perceived that nothing was to be donefor the present, and had gone away to breakfast at Henderson's house.There were four or five boys sitting on the edge of the Pit, withtheir feet dangling, and amusing themselves--until I stopped them--bythrowing stones at the giant mass.  After I had spoken to them aboutit, they began playing at &quot;touch&quot; in and out of the group ofbystanders.Among these were a couple of cyclists, a jobbing gardener Iemployed sometimes, a girl carrying a baby, Gregg the butcher and hislittle boy, and two or three loafers and golf caddies who wereaccustomed to hang about the railway station.  There was very littletalking.  Few of the common people in England had anything but thevaguest astronomical ideas in those days.  Most of them were staringquietly at the big table like end of the cylinder, which was still asOgilvy and Henderson had left it.  I fancy the popular expectation ofa heap of charred corpses was disappointed at this inanimate bulk.Some went away while I was there, and other people came.  I clamberedinto the pit and fancied I heard a faint movement under my feet.  Thetop had certainly ceased to rotate.It was only when I got thus close to it that the strangeness ofthis object was at all evident to me.  At the first glance it wasreally no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blownacross the road.  Not so much so, indeed.  It looked like a rusty gasfloat.  It required a certain amount of scientific education toperceive that the grey scale of the Thing was no common oxide, thatthe yellowish-white metal that gleamed in the crack between the lidand the cylinder had an unfamiliar hue.  &quot;Extra-terrestrial&quot; had nomeaning for most of the onlookers.At that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the Thing hadcome from the planet Mars, but I judged it improbable that itcontained any living creature.  I thought the unscrewing might beautomatic.  In spite of Ogilvy, I still believed that there were menin Mars.  My mind ran fancifully on the possibilities of itscontaining manuscript, on the difficulties in translation that mightarise, whether we should find coins and models in it, and so forth.Yet it was a little too large for assurance on this idea.  I felt animpatience to see it opened.  About eleven, as nothing seemedhappening, I walked back, full of such thought, to my home in Maybury.But I found it difficult to get to work upon my abstractinvestigations.In the afternoon the appearance of the common had altered verymuch.  The early editions of the evening papers had startled Londonwith enormous headlines:  &quot;A MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM MARS.&quot;  &quot;REMARKABLE STORY FROM WOKING,&quot;and so forth.  In addition, Ogilvy's wire to the Astronomical Exchangehad roused every observatory in the three kingdoms.There were half a dozen flies or more from the Woking stationstanding in the road by the sand pits, a basket-chaise from Chobham,and a rather lordly carriage.  Besides that, there was quite a heap ofbicycles.  In addition, a large number of people must have walked, inspite of the heat of the day, from Woking and Chertsey, so that therewas altogether quite a considerable crowd--one or two gaily dressedladies among the others.It was glaringly hot, not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind,and the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees.  Theburning heather had been extinguished, but the level ground towardsOttershaw was blackened as far as one could see, and still giving offvertical streamers of smoke.  An enterprising sweet-stuff dealer inthe Chobham Road had sent up his son with a barrow-load of greenapples and ginger beer.Going to the edge of the pit, I found it occupied by a group ofabout half a dozen men--Henderson, Ogilvy, and a tall, fair-haired manthat I afterwards learned was Stent, the Astronomer Royal, withseveral workmen wielding spades and pickaxes.  Stent was givingdirections in a clear, high-pitched voice.  He was standing on thecylinder, which was now evidently much cooler; his face was crimsonand streaming with perspiration, and something seemed to haveirritated him.A large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered, though itslower end was still embedded.  As soon as Ogilvy saw me among thestaring crowd on the edge of the pit he called to me to come down, andasked me if I would mind going over to see Lord Hilton, the lord ofthe manor.The growing crowd, he said, was becoming a serious impediment totheir excavations, especially the boys.  They wanted a light railingput up, and help to keep the people back.  He told me that a faintstirring was occasionally still audible within the case, but that theworkmen had failed to unscrew the top, as it afforded no grip to them.The case appeared to be enormously thick, and it was possible that thefaint sounds we heard represented a noisy tumult in the interior.I was very glad to do as he asked, and so become one of theprivileged spectators within the contemplated enclosure.  I failed tofind Lord Hilton at his house, but I was told he was expected fromLondon by the six o'clock train from Waterloo; and as it was thenabout a quarter past five, I went home, had some tea, and walked up tothe station to waylay him.CHAPTER FOURTHE CYLINDER OPENSWhen I returned to the common the sun was setting.  Scattered groupswere hurrying from the direction of Woking, and one or two personswere returning.  The crowd about the pit had increased, and stood outblack against the lemon yellow of the sky--a couple of hundred people,perhaps.  There were raised voices, and some sort of struggle appearedto be going on about the pit.  Strange imaginings passed through mymind.  As I drew nearer I heard Stent's voice:&quot;Keep back!  Keep back!&quot;A boy came running towards me.&quot;It's a-movin',&quot; he said to me as he passed; &quot;a-screwin' anda-screwin' out.  I don't like it.  I'm a-goin' 'ome, I am.&quot;I went on to the crowd.  There were really, I should think, two orthree hundred people elbowing and jostling one another, the one or twoladies there being by no means the least active.&quot;He's fallen in the pit!&quot; cried some one.&quot;Keep back!&quot; said several.The crowd swayed a little, and I elbowed my way through.  Every oneseemed greatly excited.  I heard a peculiar humming sound from thepit.&quot;I say!&quot; said Ogilvy; &quot;help keep these idiots back.  We don't knowwhat's in the confounded thing, you know!&quot;I saw a young man, a shop assistant in Woking I believe he was,standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again.The crowd had pushed him in.The end of the cylinder was being screwed out from within.  Nearlytwo feet of shining screw projected.  Somebody blundered against me,and I narrowly missed being pitched onto the top of the screw.  Iturned, and as I did so the screw must have come out, for the lid ofthe cylinder fell upon the gravel with a ringing concussion.  I stuckmy elbow into the person behind me, and turned my head towards theThing again.  For a moment that circular cavity seemed perfectly black.I had the sunset in my eyes.I think everyone expected to see a man emerge--possibly something alittle unlike us terrestrial men, but in all essentials a man.  I knowI did.  But, looking, I presently saw something stirring within theshadow: greyish billowy movements, one above another, and then twoluminous disks--like eyes.  Then something resembling a little greysnake, about the thickness of a walking stick, coiled up out of thewrithing middle, and wriggled in the air towards me--and then another.A sudden chill came over me.  There was a loud shriek from a womanbehind.  I half turned, keeping my eyes fixed upon the cylinder still,from which other tentacles were now projecting, and began pushing myway back from the edge of the pit.  I saw astonishment giving place tohorror on the faces of the people about me.  I heard inarticulateexclamations on all sides.  There was a general movement backwards.I saw the shopman struggling still on the edge of the pit.  I foundmyself alone, and saw the people on the other side of the pit runningoff, Stent among them.  I looked again at the cylinder, andungovernable terror gripped me.  I stood petrified and staring.A big greyish rounded bulk, the size, perhaps, of a bear, wasrising slowly and painfully out of the cylinder.  As it bulged up andcaught the light, it glistened like wet leather.Two large dark-coloured eyes were regarding me steadfastly.  Themass that framed them, the head of the thing, was rounded, and had,one might say, a face.  There was a mouth under the eyes, the liplessbrim of which quivered and panted, and dropped saliva.  The wholecreature heaved and pulsated convulsively.  A lank tentacularappendage gripped the edge of the cylinder, another swayed in the air.Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imagine thestrange horror of its appearance.  The peculiar V-shaped mouth withits pointed upper lip, the absence of brow ridges, the absence of achin beneath the wedgelike lower lip, the incessant quivering of thismouth, the Gorgon groups of tentacles, the tumultuous breathing of thelungs in a strange atmosphere, the evident heaviness and painfulnessof movement due to the greater gravitational energy of the earth--aboveall, the extraordinary intensity of the immense eyes--were atonce vital, intense, inhuman, crippled and monstrous.  There wassomething fungoid in the oily brown skin, something in the clumsydeliberation of the tedious movements unspeakably nasty.  Even at thisfirst encounter, this first glimpse, I was overcome with disgust anddread.Suddenly the monster vanished.  It had toppled over the brim of thecylinder and fallen into the pit, with a thud like the fall of a greatmass of leather.  I heard it give a peculiar thick cry, and forthwithanother of these creatures appeared darkly in the deep shadow of theaperture.I turned and, running madly, made for the first group of trees,perhaps a hundred yards away; but I ran slantingly and stumbling, forI could not avert my face from these things.There, among some young pine trees and furze bushes, I stopped,panting, and waited further developments.  The common round the sandpits was dotted with people, standing like myself in a half-fascinatedterror, staring at these creatures, or rather at the heaped gravel atthe edge of the pit in which they lay.  And then, with a renewedhorror, I saw a round, black object bobbing up and down on the edge ofthe pit.  It was the head of the shopman who had fallen in, butshowing as a little black object against the hot western sun.  Now hegot his shoulder and knee up, and again he seemed to slip back untilonly his head was visible.  Suddenly he vanished, and I could havefancied a faint shriek had reached me.  I had a momentary impulse togo back and help him that my fears overruled.Everything was then quite invisible, hidden by the deep pit and theheap of sand that the fall of the cylinder had made.  Anyone comingalong the road from Chobham or Woking would have been amazed at thesight--a dwindling multitude of perhaps a hundred people or morestanding in a great irregular circle, in ditches, behind bushes,behind gates and hedges, saying little to one another and that inshort, excited shouts, and staring, staring hard at a few heaps ofsand.  The barrow of ginger beer stood, a queer derelict, blackagainst the burning sky, and in the sand pits was a row of desertedvehicles with their horses feeding out of nosebags or pawing theground.CHAPTER FIVETHE HEAT-RAYAfter the glimpse I had had of the Martians emerging from thecylinder in which they had come to the earth from their planet, a kindof fascination paralysed my actions.  I remained standing knee-deep inthe heather, staring at the mound that hid them.  I was a battlegroundof fear and curiosity.I did not dare to go back towards the pit, but I felt a passionatelonging to peer into it.  I began walking, therefore, in a big curve,seeking some point of vantage and continually looking at the sandheaps that hid these new-comers to our earth.  Once a leash of thinblack whips, like the arms of an octopus, flashed across the sunsetand was immediately withdrawn, and afterwards a thin rod rose up,joint by joint, bearing at its apex a circular disk that spun with awobbling motion.  What could be going on there?Most of the spectators had gathered in one or two groups--one alittle crowd towards Woking, the other a knot of people in thedirection of Chobham.  Evidently they shared my mental conflict.There were few near me.  One man I approached--he was, I perceived,a neighbour of mine, though I did not know his name--and accosted.But it was scarcely a time for articulate conversation.&quot;What ugly _brutes_!&quot; he said.  &quot;Good God!  What ugly brutes!&quot;  Herepeated this over and over again.&quot;Did you see a man in the pit?&quot; I said; but he made no answer tothat.  We became silent, and stood watching for a time side by side,deriving, I fancy, a certain comfort in one another's company.  Then Ishifted my position to a little knoll that gave me the advantage of ayard or more of elevation and when I looked for him presently he waswalking towards Woking.The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened.  Thecrowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and Iheard now a faint murmur from it.  The little knot of people towardsChobham dispersed.  There was scarcely an intimation of movement fromthe pit.It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and Isuppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restoreconfidence.  At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittentmovement upon the sand pits began, a movement that seemed to gatherforce as the stillness of the evening about the cylinder remainedunbroken.  Vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance,stop, watch, and advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thinirregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuatedhorns.  I, too, on my side began to move towards the pit.Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sandpits, and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels.  I saw alad trundling off the barrow of apples.  And then, within thirty yardsof the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a littleblack knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.This was the Deputation.  There had been a hasty consultation, andsince the Martians were evidently, in spite of their repulsive forms,intelligent creatures, it had been resolved to show them, byapproaching them with signals, that we too were intelligent.Flutter, flutter, went the flag, first to the right, then to theleft.  It was too far for me to recognise anyone there, but afterwardsI learned that Ogilvy, Stent, and Henderson were with others in thisattempt at communication.  This little group had in its advancedragged inward, so to speak, the circumference of the now almostcomplete circle of people, and a number of dim black figures followedit at discreet distances.Suddenly there was a flash of light, and a quantity of luminousgreenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs, whichdrove up, one after the other, straight into the still air.This smoke (or flame, perhaps, would be the better word for it) wasso bright that the deep blue sky overhead and the hazy stretches ofbrown common towards Chertsey, set with black pine trees, seemed todarken abruptly as these puffs arose, and to remain the darker aftertheir dispersal.  At the same time a faint hissing sound becameaudible.Beyond the pit stood the little wedge of people with the white flagat its apex, arrested by these phenomena, a little knot of smallvertical black shapes upon the black ground.  As the green smoke arose,their faces flashed out pallid green, and faded again as it vanished.Then slowly the hissing passed into a humming, into a long, loud,droning noise.  Slowly a humped shape rose out of the pit, and theghost of a beam of light seemed to flicker out from it.Forthwith flashes of actual flame, a bright glare leaping from oneto another, sprang from the scattered group of men.  It was as if someinvisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into white flame.  It wasas if each man were suddenly and momentarily turned to fire.Then, by the light of their own destruction, I saw them staggeringand falling, and their supporters turning to run.I stood staring, not as yet realising that this was death leapingfrom man to man in that little distant crowd.  All I felt was that itwas something very strange.  An almost noiseless and blinding flash oflight, and a man fell headlong and lay still; and as the unseen shaftof heat passed over them, pine trees burst into fire, and every dryfurze bush became with one dull thud a mass of flames.  And far awaytowards Knaphill I saw the flashes of trees and hedges and woodenbuildings suddenly set alight.It was sweeping round swiftly and steadily, this flaming death,this invisible, inevitable sword of heat.  I perceived it comingtowards me by the flashing bushes it touched, and was too astoundedand stupefied to stir.  I heard the crackle of fire in the sand pitsand the sudden squeal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled.  Thenit was as if an invisible yet intensely heated finger were drawnthrough the heather between me and the Martians, and all along acurving line beyond the sand pits the dark ground smoked and crackled.Something fell with a crash far away to the left where the road fromWoking station opens out on the common.  Forth-with the hissing andhumming ceased, and the black, dome-like object sank slowly out ofsight into the pit.All this had happened with such swiftness that I had stoodmotionless, dumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes of light.  Had thatdeath swept through a full circle, it must inevitably have slain me inmy surprise.  But it passed and spared me, and left the night about mesuddenly dark and unfamiliar.The undulating common seemed now dark almost to blackness, exceptwhere its roadways lay grey and pale under the deep blue sky of theearly night.  It was dark, and suddenly void of men.  Overhead thestars were mustering, and in the west the sky was still a pale,bright, almost greenish blue.  The tops of the pine trees and theroofs of Horsell came out sharp and black against the westernafterglow.  The Martians and their appliances were altogetherinvisible, save for that thin mast upon which their restless mirrorwobbled.  Patches of bush and isolated trees here and there smoked andglowed still, and the houses towards Woking station were sending upspires of flame into the stillness of the evening air.Nothing was changed save for that and a terrible astonishment.  Thelittle group of black specks with the flag of white had been swept outof existence, and the stillness of the evening, so it seemed to me,had scarcely been broken.It came to me that I was upon this dark common, helpless,unprotected, and alone.  Suddenly, like a thing falling upon me fromwithout, came--fear.With an effort I turned and began a stumbling run through theheather.The fear I felt was no rational fear, but a panic terror not onlyof the Martians, but of the dusk and stillness all about me.  Such anextraordinary effect in unmanning me it had that I ran weepingsilently as a child might do.  Once I had turned, I did not dare tolook back.I remember I felt an extraordinary persuasion that I was beingplayed with, that presently, when I was upon the very verge of safety,this mysterious death--as swift as the passage of light--would leapafter me from the pit about the cylinder and strike me down.CHAPTER SIXTHE HEAT-RAY IN THE CHOBHAM ROADIt is still a matter of wonder how the Martians are able to slaymen so swiftly and so silently.  Many think that in some way they areable to generate an intense heat in a chamber of practically absolutenon-conductivity.  This intense heat they project in a parallel beamagainst any object they choose, by means of a polished parabolicmirror of unknown composition, much as the parabolic mirror of alighthouse projects a beam of light.  But no one has absolutely provedthese details.  However it is done, it is certain that a beam of heatis the essence of the matter.  Heat, and invisible, instead ofvisible, light.  Whatever is combustible flashes into flame at itstouch, lead runs like water, it softens iron, cracks and melts glass,and when it falls upon water, incontinently that explodes into steam.That night nearly forty people lay under the starlight about thepit, charred and distorted beyond recognition, and all night long thecommon from Horsell to Maybury was deserted and brightly ablaze.The news of the massacre probably reached Chobham, Woking, andOttershaw about the same time.  In Woking the shops had closed whenthe tragedy happened, and a number of people, shop people and soforth, attracted by the stories they had heard, were walking over theHorsell Bridge and along the road between the hedges that runs out atlast upon the common.  You may imagine the young people brushed upafter the labours of the day, and making this novelty, as they wouldmake any novelty, the excuse for walking together and enjoying atrivial flirtation.  You may figure to yourself the hum of voicesalong the road in the gloaming. . . .As yet, of course, few people in Woking even knew that the cylinderhad opened, though poor Henderson had sent a messenger on a bicycle tothe post office with a special wire to an evening paper.As these folks came out by twos and threes upon the open, theyfound little knots of people talking excitedly and peering at thespinning mirror over the sand pits, and the newcomers were, no doubt,soon infected by the excitement of the occasion.By half past eight, when the Deputation was destroyed, there mayhave been a crowd of three hundred people or more at this place,besides those who had left the road to approach the Martians nearer.There were three policemen too, one of whom was mounted, doing theirbest, under instructions from Stent, to keep the people back and deterthem from approaching the cylinder.  There was some booing from thosemore thoughtless and excitable souls to whom a crowd is always anoccasion for noise and horse-play.Stent and Ogilvy, anticipating some possibilities of a collision,had telegraphed from Horsell to the barracks as soon as the Martiansemerged, for the help of a company of soldiers to protect thesestrange creatures from violence.  After that they returned to lead thatill-fated advance.  The description of their death, as it was seen bythe crowd, tallies very closely with my own impressions: the threepuffs of green smoke, the deep humming note, and the flashes of flame.But that crowd of people had a far narrower escape than mine.  Onlythe fact that a hummock of heathery sand intercepted the lower part ofthe Heat-Ray saved them.  Had the elevation of the parabolic mirrorbeen a few yards higher, none could have lived to tell the tale.  Theysaw the flashes and the men falling and an invisible hand, as it were,lit the bushes as it hurried towards them through the twilight.  Then,with a whistling note that rose above the droning of the pit, the beamswung close over their heads, lighting the tops of the beech treesthat line the road, and splitting the bricks, smashing the windows,firing the window frames, and bringing down in crumbling ruin aportion of the gable of the house nearest the corner.In the sudden thud, hiss, and glare of the igniting trees, thepanic-stricken crowd seems to have swayed hesitatingly for somemoments.  Sparks and burning twigs began to fall into the road, andsingle leaves like puffs of flame.  Hats and dresses caught fire.  Thencame a crying from the common.  There were shrieks and shouts, andsuddenly a mounted policeman came galloping through the confusion withhis hands clasped over his head, screaming.&quot;They're coming!&quot; a woman shrieked, and incontinently everyone wasturning and pushing at those behind, in order to clear their way toWoking again.  They must have bolted as blindly as a flock of sheep.Where the road grows narrow and black between the high banks the crowdjammed, and a desperate struggle occurred.  All that crowd did notescape; three persons at least, two women and a little boy, werecrushed and trampled there, and left to die amid the terror and thedarkness.CHAPTER SEVENHOW I REACHED HOMEFor my own part, I remember nothing of my flight except the stressof blundering against trees and stumbling through the heather.  Allabout me gathered the invisible terrors of the Martians; that pitilesssword of heat seemed whirling to and fro, flourishing overhead beforeit descended and smote me out of life.  I came into the road betweenthe crossroads and Horsell, and ran along this to the crossroads.At last I could go no further; I was exhausted with the violence ofmy emotion and of my flight, and I staggered and fell by the wayside.That was near the bridge that crosses the canal by the gasworks.  Ifell and lay still.I must have remained there some time.I sat up, strangely perplexed.  For a moment, perhaps, I could notclearly understand how I came there.  My terror had fallen from melike a garment.  My hat had gone, and my collar had burst away fromits fastener.  A few minutes before, there had only been three realthings before me--the immensity of the night and space and nature, myown feebleness and anguish, and the near approach of death.  Now itwas as if something turned over, and the point of view alteredabruptly.  There was no sensible transition from one state of mind tothe other.  I was immediately the self of every day again--a decent,ordinary citizen.  The silent common, the impulse of my flight, thestarting flames, were as if they had been in a dream.  I asked myselfhad these latter things indeed happened?  I could not credit it.I rose and walked unsteadily up the steep incline of the bridge.  Mymind was blank wonder.  My muscles and nerves seemed drained of theirstrength.  I dare say I staggered drunkenly.  A head rose over thearch, and the figure of a workman carrying a basket appeared.  Besidehim ran a little boy.  He passed me, wishing me good night.  I wasminded to speak to him, but did not.  I answered his greeting with ameaningless mumble and went on over the bridge.Over the Maybury arch a train, a billowing tumult of white, firelitsmoke, and a long caterpillar of lighted windows, went flyingsouth--clatter, clatter, clap, rap, and it had gone.  A dim group ofpeople talked in the gate of one of the houses in the pretty littlerow of gables that was called Oriental Terrace.  It was all so realand so familiar.  And that behind me!  It was frantic, fantastic!Such things, I told myself, could not be.Perhaps I am a man of exceptional moods.  I do not know how far myexperience is common.  At times I suffer from the strangest sense ofdetachment from myself and the world about me; I seem to watch it allfrom the outside, from somewhere inconceivably remote, out of time,out of space, out of the stress and tragedy of it all.  This feelingwas very strong upon me that night.  Here was another side to mydream.But the trouble was the blank incongruity of this serenity and theswift death flying yonder, not two miles away.  There was a noise ofbusiness from the gasworks, and the electric lamps were all alight.  Istopped at the group of people.&quot;What news from the common?&quot; said I.There were two men and a woman at the gate.&quot;Eh?&quot; said one of the men, turning.&quot;What news from the common?&quot; I said.&quot;'Ain't yer just _been_ there?&quot; asked the men.&quot;People seem fair silly about the common,&quot; said the woman over thegate.  &quot;What's it all abart?&quot;&quot;Haven't you heard of the men from Mars?&quot; said I; &quot;the creaturesfrom Mars?&quot;&quot;Quite enough,&quot; said the woman over the gate.  &quot;Thenks&quot;; and allthree of them laughed.I felt foolish and angry.  I tried and found I could not tell themwhat I had seen.  They laughed again at my broken sentences.&quot;You'll hear more yet,&quot; I said, and went on to my home.I startled my wife at the doorway, so haggard was I.  I went intothe dining room, sat down, drank some wine, and so soon as I couldcollect myself sufficiently I told her the things I had seen.  Thedinner, which was a cold one, had already been served, and remainedneglected on the table while I told my story.&quot;There is one thing,&quot; I said, to allay the fears I had aroused;&quot;they are the most sluggish things I ever saw crawl.  They may keepthe pit and kill people who come near them, but they cannot get outof it. . . .  But the horror of them!&quot;&quot;Don't, dear!&quot; said my wife, knitting her brows and putting herhand on mine.&quot;Poor Ogilvy!&quot; I said.  &quot;To think he may be lying dead there!&quot;My wife at least did not find my experience incredible.  When I sawhow deadly white her face was, I ceased abruptly.&quot;They may come here,&quot; she said again and again.I pressed her to take wine, and tried to reassure her.&quot;They can scarcely move,&quot; I said.I began to comfort her and myself by repeating all that Ogilvy hadtold me of the impossibility of the Martians establishing themselveson the earth.  In particular I laid stress on the gravitationaldifficulty.  On the surface of the earth the force of gravity is threetimes what it is on the surface of Mars.  A Martian, therefore, wouldweigh three times more than on Mars, albeit his muscular strengthwould be the same.  His own body would be a cope of lead to him.  That,indeed, was the general opinion.  Both _The Times_ and the _DailyTelegraph_, for instance, insisted on it the next morning, and bothoverlooked, just as I did, two obvious modifying influences.The atmosphere of the earth, we now know, contains far more oxygenor far less argon (whichever way one likes to put it) than does Mars.The invigorating influences of this excess of oxygen upon the Martiansindisputably did much to counterbalance the increased weight of theirbodies.  And, in the second place, we all overlooked the fact thatsuch mechanical intelligence as the Martian possessed was quite ableto dispense with muscular exertion at a pinch.But I did not consider these points at the time, and so myreasoning was dead against the chances of the invaders.  With wine andfood, the confidence of my own table, and the necessity of reassuringmy wife, I grew by insensible degrees courageous and secure.&quot;They have done a foolish thing,&quot; said I, fingering my wineglass.&quot;They are dangerous because, no doubt, they are mad with terror.Perhaps they expected to find no living things--certainly nointelligent living things.&quot;&quot;A shell in the pit&quot; said I, &quot;if the worst comes to the worst willkill them all.&quot;The intense excitement of the events had no doubt left myperceptive powers in a state of erethism.  I remember that dinnertable with extraordinary vividness even now.  My dear wife's sweetanxious face peering at me from under the pink lamp shade, the whitecloth with its silver and glass table furniture--for in those dayseven philosophical writers had many little luxuries--the crimson-purplewine in my glass, are photographically distinct.  At the end ofit I sat, tempering nuts with a cigarette, regretting Ogilvy'srashness, and denouncing the shortsighted timidity of the Martians.So some respectable dodo in the Mauritius might have lorded it inhis nest, and discussed the arrival of that shipful of pitilesssailors in want of animal food.  &quot;We will peck them to death tomorrow,my dear.&quot;I did not know it, but that was the last civilised dinner I was toeat for very many strange and terrible days.CHAPTER EIGHTFRIDAY NIGHTThe most extraordinary thing to my mind, of all the strange andwonderful things that happened upon that Friday, was the dovetailingof the commonplace habits of our social order with the firstbeginnings of the series of events that was to topple that socialorder headlong.  If on Friday night you had taken a pair of compassesand drawn a circle with a radius of five miles round the Woking sandpits, I doubt if you would have had one human being outside it, unlessit were some relation of Stent or of the three or four cyclists orLondon people lying dead on the common, whose emotions or habits wereat all affected by the new-comers.  Many people had heard of thecylinder, of course, and talked about it in their leisure, but itcertainly did not make the sensation that an ultimatum to Germanywould have done.In London that night poor Henderson's telegram describing thegradual unscrewing of the shot was judged to be a canard, and hisevening paper, after wiring for authentication from him and receivingno reply--the man was killed--decided not to print a special edition.Even within the five-mile circle the great majority of people wereinert.  I have already described the behaviour of the men and women towhom I spoke.  All over the district people were dining and supping;working men were gardening after the labours of the day, childrenwere being put to bed, young people were wandering through the laneslove-making, students sat over their books.Maybe there was a murmur in the village streets, a novel anddominant topic in the public-houses, and here and there a messenger,or even an eye-witness of the later occurrences, caused a whirl ofexcitement, a shouting, and a running to and fro; but for the mostpart the daily routine of working, eating, drinking, sleeping, went onas it had done for countless years--as though no planet Mars existedin the sky.  Even at Woking station and Horsell and Chobham that wasthe case.In Woking junction, until a late hour, trains were stopping andgoing on, others were shunting on the sidings, passengers werealighting and waiting, and everything was proceeding in the mostordinary way.  A boy from the town, trenching on Smith's monopoly, wasselling papers with the afternoon's news.  The ringing impact oftrucks, the sharp whistle of the engines from the junction, mingledwith their shouts of &quot;Men from Mars!&quot;  Excited men came into thestation about nine o'clock with incredible tidings, and caused no moredisturbance than drunkards might have done.  People rattlingLondonwards peered into the darkness outside the carriage windows, andsaw only a rare, flickering, vanishing spark dance up from thedirection of Horsell, a red glow and a thin veil of smoke drivingacross the stars, and thought that nothing more serious than a heathfire was happening.  It was only round the edge of the common that anydisturbance was perceptible.  There were half a dozen villas burningon the Woking border.  There were lights in all the houses on thecommon side of the three villages, and the people there kept awaketill dawn.A curious crowd lingered restlessly, people coming and going butthe crowd remaining, both on the Chobham and Horsell bridges.  One ortwo adventurous souls, it was afterwards found, went into the darknessand crawled quite near the Martians; but they never returned, for nowand again a light-ray, like the beam of a warship's searchlight sweptthe common, and the Heat-Ray was ready to follow.  Save for such, thatbig area of common was silent and desolate, and the charred bodies layabout on it all night under the stars, and all the next day.  A noiseof hammering from the pit was heard by many people.So you have the state of things on Friday night.  In the centre,sticking into the skin of our old planet Earth like a poisoned dart,was this cylinder.  But the poison was scarcely working yet.  Aroundit was a patch of silent common, smouldering in places, and with a fewdark, dimly seen objects lying in contorted attitudes here and there.Here and there was a burning bush or tree.  Beyond was a fringe ofexcitement, and farther than that fringe the inflammation had notcrept as yet.  In the rest of the world the stream of life stillflowed as it had flowed for immemorial years.  The fever of war thatwould presently clog vein and artery, deaden nerve and destroy brain,had still to develop.All night long the Martians were hammering and stirring, sleepless,indefatigable, at work upon the machines they were making ready, andever and again a puff of greenish-white smoke whirled up to thestarlit sky.About eleven a company of soldiers came through Horsell, anddeployed along the edge of the common to form a cordon.  Later asecond company marched through Chobham to deploy on the north side ofthe common.  Several officers from the Inkerman barracks had been onthe common earlier in the day, and one, Major Eden, was reported to bemissing.  The colonel of the regiment came to the Chobham bridge andwas busy questioning the crowd at midnight.  The military authoritieswere certainly alive to the seriousness of the business.  Abouteleven, the next morning's papers were able to say, a squadron ofhussars, two Maxims, and about four hundred men of the Cardiganregiment started from Aldershot.A few seconds after midnight the crowd in the Chertsey road,Woking, saw a star fall from heaven into the pine woods to thenorthwest.  It had a greenish colour, and caused a silent brightnesslike summer lightning.  This was the second cylinder.CHAPTER NINETHE FIGHTING BEGINSSaturday lives in my memory as a day of suspense.  It was a day oflassitude too, hot and close, with, I am told, a rapidly fluctuatingbarometer.  I had slept but little, though my wife had succeeded insleeping, and I rose early.  I went into my garden before breakfastand stood listening, but towards the common there was nothing stirringbut a lark.The milkman came as usual.  I heard the rattle of his chariot and Iwent round to the side gate to ask the latest news.  He told me thatduring the night the Martians had been surrounded by troops, and thatguns were expected.  Then--a familiar, reassuring note--I heard a trainrunning towards Woking.&quot;They aren't to be killed,&quot; said the milkman, &quot;if that can possiblybe avoided.&quot;I saw my neighbour gardening, chatted with him for a time, and thenstrolled in to breakfast.  It was a most unexceptional morning.  Myneighbour was of opinion that the troops would be able to capture orto destroy the Martians during the day.&quot;It's a pity they make themselves so unapproachable,&quot; he said.  &quot;Itwould be curious to know how they live on another planet; we mightlearn a thing or two.&quot;He came up to the fence and extended a handful of strawberries, forhis gardening was as generous as it was enthusiastic.  At the sametime he told me of the burning of the pine woods about the ByfleetGolf Links.&quot;They say,&quot; said he, &quot;that there's another of those blessed thingsfallen there--number two.  But one's enough, surely.  This lot'll costthe insurance people a pretty penny before everything's settled.&quot;  Helaughed with an air of the greatest good humour as he said this.  Thewoods, he said, were still burning, and pointed out a haze of smoke tome.  &quot;They will be hot under foot for days, on account of the thicksoil of pine needles and turf,&quot; he said, and then grew serious over&quot;poor Ogilvy.&quot;After breakfast, instead of working, I decided to walk downtowards the common.  Under the railway bridge I found a group ofsoldiers--sappers, I think, men in small round caps, dirty red jacketsunbuttoned, and showing their blue shirts, dark trousers, and bootscoming to the calf.  They told me no one was allowed over the canal,and, looking along the road towards the bridge, I saw one of theCardigan men standing sentinel there.  I talked with these soldiersfor a time; I told them of my sight of the Martians on the previousevening.  None of them had seen the Martians, and they had but thevaguest ideas of them, so that they plied me with questions.  Theysaid that they did not know who had authorised the movements of thetroops; their idea was that a dispute had arisen at the Horse Guards.The ordinary sapper is a great deal better educated than the commonsoldier, and they discussed the peculiar conditions of the possiblefight with some acuteness.  I described the Heat-Ray to them, and theybegan to argue among themselves.&quot;Crawl up under cover and rush 'em, say I,&quot; said one.&quot;Get aht!&quot; said another.  &quot;What's cover against this 'ere 'eat?Sticks to cook yer!  What we got to do is to go as near as theground'll let us, and then drive a trench.&quot;&quot;Blow yer trenches!  You always want trenches; you ought to ha'been born a rabbit Snippy.&quot;&quot;Ain't they got any necks, then?&quot; said a third, abruptly--a little,contemplative, dark man, smoking a pipe.I repeated my description.&quot;Octopuses,&quot; said he, &quot;that's what I calls 'em.  Talk about fishersof men--fighters of fish it is this time!&quot;&quot;It ain't no murder killing beasts like that,&quot; said the firstspeaker.&quot;Why not shell the darned things strite off and finish 'em?&quot; saidthe little dark man.  &quot;You carn tell what they might do.&quot;&quot;Where's your shells?&quot; said the first speaker.  &quot;There ain't notime.  Do it in a rush, that's my tip, and do it at once.&quot;So they discussed it.  After a while I left them, and went on tothe railway station to get as many morning papers as I could.But I will not weary the reader with a description of that longmorning and of the longer afternoon.  I did not succeed in getting aglimpse of the common, for even Horsell and Chobham church towers werein the hands of the military authorities.  The soldiers I addresseddidn't know anything; the officers were mysterious as well as busy.  Ifound people in the town quite secure again in the presence of themilitary, and I heard for the first time from Marshall, thetobacconist, that his son was among the dead on the common.  Thesoldiers had made the people on the outskirts of Horsell lock up andleave their houses.I got back to lunch about two, very tired for, as I have said, theday was extremely hot and dull; and in order to refresh myself I tooka cold bath in the afternoon.  About half past four I went up to therailway station to get an evening paper, for the morning papers hadcontained only a very inaccurate description of the killing of Stent,Henderson, Ogilvy, and the others.  But there was little I didn'tknow.  The Martians did not show an inch of themselves.  They seemedbusy in their pit, and there was a sound of hammering and an almostcontinuous streamer of smoke.  Apparently they were busy getting readyfor a struggle.  &quot;Fresh attempts have been made to signal, but withoutsuccess,&quot; was the stereotyped formula of the papers.  A sapper told meit was done by a man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole.  TheMartians took as much notice of such advances as we should of thelowing of a cow.I must confess the sight of all this armament, all thispreparation, greatly excited me.  My imagination became belligerent,and defeated the invaders in a dozen striking ways; something of myschoolboy dreams of battle and heroism came back.  It hardly seemed afair fight to me at that time.  They seemed very helpless in that pitof theirs.About three o'clock there began the thud of a gun at measuredintervals from Chertsey or Addlestone.  I learned that the smoulderingpine wood into which the second cylinder had fallen was being shelled,in the hope of destroying that object before it opened.  It was onlyabout five, however, that a field gun reached Chobham for use againstthe first body of Martians.About six in the evening, as I sat at tea with my wife in thesummerhouse talking vigorously about the battle that was lowering uponus, I heard a muffled detonation from the common, and immediatelyafter a gust of firing.  Close on the heels of that came a violentrattling crash, quite close to us, that shook the ground; and,starting out upon the lawn, I saw the tops of the trees about theOriental College burst into smoky red flame, and the tower of thelittle church beside it slide down into ruin.  The pinnacle of themosque had vanished, and the roof line of the college itself looked asif a hundred-ton gun had been at work upon it.  One of our chimneyscracked as if a shot had hit it, flew, and a piece of it cameclattering down the tiles and made a heap of broken red fragments uponthe flower bed by my study window.I and my wife stood amazed.  Then I realised that the crest ofMaybury Hill must be within range of the Martians' Heat-Ray now thatthe college was cleared out of the way.At that I gripped my wife's arm, and without ceremony ran her outinto the road.  Then I fetched out the servant, telling her I would goupstairs myself for the box she was clamouring for.&quot;We can't possibly stay here,&quot; I said; and as I spoke the firingreopened for a moment upon the common.&quot;But where are we to go?&quot; said my wife in terror.I thought perplexed.  Then I remembered her cousins at Leatherhead.&quot;Leatherhead!&quot; I shouted above the sudden noise.She looked away from me downhill.  The people were coming out oftheir houses, astonished.&quot;How are we to get to Leatherhead?&quot; she said.Down the hill I saw a bevy of hussars ride under the railwaybridge; three galloped through the open gates of the Oriental College;two others dismounted, and began running from house to house.  Thesun, shining through the smoke that drove up from the tops of thetrees, seemed blood red, and threw an unfamiliar lurid light uponeverything.&quot;Stop here,&quot; said I; &quot;you are safe here&quot;; and I started off at oncefor the Spotted Dog, for I knew the landlord had a horse and dog cart.I ran, for I perceived that in a moment everyone upon this side of thehill would be moving.  I found him in his bar, quite unaware of whatwas going on behind his house.  A man stood with his back to me,talking to him.&quot;I must have a pound,&quot; said the landlord, &quot;and I've no one to driveit.&quot;&quot;I'll give you two,&quot; said I, over the stranger's shoulder.&quot;What for?&quot;&quot;And I'll bring it back by midnight,&quot; I said.&quot;Lord!&quot; said the landlord; &quot;what's the hurry?  I'm selling my bitof a pig.  Two pounds, and you bring it back?  What's going on now?&quot;I explained hastily that I had to leave my home, and so secured thedog cart.  At the time it did not seem to me nearly so urgent that thelandlord should leave his.  I took care to have the cart there andthen, drove it off down the road, and, leaving it in charge of my wifeand servant, rushed into my house and packed a few valuables, suchplate as we had, and so forth.  The beech trees below the house wereburning while I did this, and the palings up the road glowed red.While I was occupied in this way, one of the dismounted hussars camerunning up.  He was going from house to house, warning people toleave.  He was going on as I came out of my front door, lugging mytreasures, done up in a tablecloth.  I shouted after him:&quot;What news?&quot;He turned, stared, bawled something about &quot;crawling out in a thinglike a dish cover,&quot; and ran on to the gate of the house at the crest.A sudden whirl of black smoke driving across the road hid him for amoment.  I ran to my neighbour's door and rapped to satisfy myself ofwhat I already knew, that his wife had gone to London with him and hadlocked up their house.  I went in again, according to my promise, toget my servant's box, lugged it out, clapped it beside her on the tailof the dog cart, and then caught the reins and jumped up into thedriver's seat beside my wife.  In another moment we were clear of thesmoke and noise, and spanking down the opposite slope of Maybury Hilltowards Old Woking.In front was a quiet sunny landscape, a wheat field ahead on eitherside of the road, and the Maybury Inn with its swinging sign.  I sawthe doctor's cart ahead of me.  At the bottom of the hill I turned myhead to look at the hillside I was leaving.  Thick streamers of blacksmoke shot with threads of red fire were driving up into the stillair, and throwing dark shadows upon the green treetops eastward.  Thesmoke already extended far away to the east and west--to the Byfleetpine woods eastward, and to Woking on the west.  The road was dottedwith people running towards us.  And very faint now, but very distinctthrough the hot, quiet air, one heard the whirr of a machine-gun thatwas presently stilled, and an intermittent cracking of rifles.Apparently the Martians were setting fire to everything within rangeof their Heat-Ray.I am not an expert driver, and I had immediately to turn myattention to the horse.  When I looked back again the second hill hadhidden the black smoke.  I slashed the horse with the whip, and gavehim a loose rein until Woking and Send lay between us and thatquivering tumult.  I overtook and passed the doctor between Woking andSend.CHAPTER TENIN THE STORMLeatherhead is about twelve miles from Maybury Hill.  The scent ofhay was in the air through the lush meadows beyond Pyrford, and thehedges on either side were sweet and gay with multitudes of dog-roses.The heavy firing that had broken out while we were driving downMaybury Hill ceased as abruptly as it began, leaving the evening verypeaceful and still.  We got to Leatherhead without misadventure aboutnine o'clock, and the horse had an hour's rest while I took supperwith my cousins and commended my wife to their care.My wife was curiously silent throughout the drive, and seemedoppressed with forebodings of evil.  I talked to her reassuringly,pointing out that the Martians were tied to the Pit by sheerheaviness, and at the utmost could but crawl a little out of it; butshe answered only in monosyllables.  Had it not been for my promise tothe innkeeper, she would, I think, have urged me to stay inLeatherhead that night.  Would that I had!  Her face, I remember, wasvery white as we parted.For my own part, I had been feverishly excited all day.  Somethingvery like the war fever that occasionally runs through a civilisedcommunity had got into my blood, and in my heart I was not so verysorry that I had to return to Maybury that night.  I was even afraidthat that last fusillade I had heard might mean the extermination ofour invaders from Mars.  I can best express my state of mind by sayingthat I wanted to be in at the death.It was nearly eleven when I started to return.  The night wasunexpectedly dark; to me, walking out of the lighted passage of mycousins' house, it seemed indeed black, and it was as hot and close asthe day.  Overhead the clouds were driving fast, albeit not a breathstirred the shrubs about us.  My cousins' man lit both lamps.  Happily,I knew the road intimately.  My wife stood in the light of thedoorway, and watched me until I jumped up into the dog cart.  Thenabruptly she turned and went in, leaving my cousins side by sidewishing me good hap.I was a little depressed at first with the contagion of my wife'sfears, but very soon my thoughts reverted to the Martians.  At thattime I was absolutely in the dark as to the course of the evening'sfighting.  I did not know even the circumstances that had precipitatedthe conflict.  As I came through Ockham (for that was the way Ireturned, and not through Send and Old Woking) I saw along the westernhorizon a blood-red glow, which as I drew nearer, crept slowly up thesky.  The driving clouds of the gathering thunderstorm mingled therewith masses of black and red smoke.Ripley Street was deserted, and except for a lighted window or sothe village showed not a sign of life; but I narrowly escaped anaccident at the corner of the road to Pyrford, where a knot of peoplestood with their backs to me.  They said nothing to me as I passed.  Ido not know what they knew of the things happening beyond the hill,nor do I know if the silent houses I passed on my way were sleepingsecurely, or deserted and empty, or harassed and watching against theterror of the night.From Ripley until I came through Pyrford I was in the valley of theWey, and the red glare was hidden from me.  As I ascended the littlehill beyond Pyrford Church the glare came into view again, and thetrees about me shivered with the first intimation of the storm thatwas upon me.  Then I heard midnight pealing out from Pyrford Churchbehind me, and then came the silhouette of Maybury Hill, with itstree-tops and roofs black and sharp against the red.Even as I beheld this a lurid green glare lit the road about me andshowed the distant woods towards Addlestone.  I felt a tug at thereins.  I saw that the driving clouds had been pierced as it were by athread of green fire, suddenly lighting their confusion and fallinginto the field to my left.  It was the third falling star!Close on its apparition, and blindingly violet by contrast, dancedout the first lightning of the gathering storm, and the thunder burstlike a rocket overhead.  The horse took the bit between his teeth andbolted.A moderate incline runs towards the foot of Maybury Hill, and downthis we clattered.  Once the lightning had begun, it went on in asrapid a succession of flashes as I have ever seen.  The thunderclaps,treading one on the heels of another and with a strange cracklingaccompaniment, sounded more like the working of a gigantic electricmachine than the usual detonating reverberations.  The flickeringlight was blinding and confusing, and a thin hail smote gustily at myface as I drove down the slope.At first I regarded little but the road before me, and thenabruptly my attention was arrested by something that was movingrapidly down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill.  At first I took itfor the wet roof of a house, but one flash following another showed itto be in swift rolling movement.  It was an elusive vision--a momentof bewildering darkness, and then, in a flash like daylight, the redmasses of the Orphanage near the crest of the hill, the green tops ofthe pine trees, and this problematical object came out clear and sharpand bright.And this Thing I saw!  How can I describe it?  A monstrous tripod,higher than many houses, striding over the young pine trees, andsmashing them aside in its career; a walking engine of glitteringmetal, striding now across the heather; articulate ropes of steeldangling from it, and the clattering tumult of its passage minglingwith the riot of the thunder.  A flash, and it came out vividly,heeling over one way with two feet in the air, to vanish and reappearalmost instantly as it seemed, with the next flash, a hundred yardsnearer.  Can you imagine a milking stool tilted and bowled violentlyalong the ground?  That was the impression those instant flashes gave.But instead of a milking stool imagine it a great body of machinery ona tripod stand.Then suddenly the trees in the pine wood ahead of me were parted,as brittle reeds are parted by a man thrusting through them; they weresnapped off and driven headlong, and a second huge tripod appeared,rushing, as it seemed, headlong towards me.  And I was galloping hardto meet it! At the sight of the second monster my nerve wentaltogether.  Not stopping to look again, I wrenched the horse's headhard round to the right and in another moment the dog cart had heeledover upon the horse; the shafts smashed noisily, and I was flungsideways and fell heavily into a shallow pool of water.I crawled out almost immediately, and crouched, my feet still inthe water, under a clump of furze.  The horse lay motionless (his neckwas broken, poor brute!) and by the lightning flashes I saw the blackbulk of the overturned dog cart and the silhouette of the wheel stillspinning slowly.  In another moment the colossal mechanism wentstriding by me, and passed uphill towards Pyrford.Seen nearer, the Thing was incredibly strange, for it was no mereinsensate machine driving on its way.  Machine it was, with a ringingmetallic pace, and long, flexible, glittering tentacles (one of whichgripped a young pine tree) swinging and rattling about its strangebody.  It picked its road as it went striding along, and the brazenhood that surmounted it moved to and fro with the inevitablesuggestion of a head looking about.  Behind the main body was a hugemass of white metal like a gigantic fisherman's basket, and puffs ofgreen smoke squirted out from the joints of the limbs as the monsterswept by me.  And in an instant it was gone.So much I saw then, all vaguely for the flickering of thelightning, in blinding highlights and dense black shadows.As it passed it set up an exultant deafening howl that drowned thethunder--&quot;Aloo!  Aloo!&quot;--and in another minute it was with itscompanion, half a mile away, stooping over something in the field.  Ihave no doubt this Thing in the field was the third of the tencylinders they had fired at us from Mars.For some minutes I lay there in the rain and darkness watching, bythe intermittent light, these monstrous beings of metal moving aboutin the distance over the hedge tops.  A thin hail was now beginning,and as it came and went their figures grew misty and then flashed intoclearness again.  Now and then came a gap in the lightning, and thenight swallowed them up.I was soaked with hail above and puddle water below.  It was sometime before my blank astonishment would let me struggle up the bank toa drier position, or think at all of my imminent peril.Not far from me was a little one-roomed squatter's hut of wood,surrounded by a patch of potato garden.  I struggled to my feet atlast, and, crouching and making use of every chance of cover, I made arun for this.  I hammered at the door, but I could not make the peoplehear (if there were any people inside), and after a time I desisted,and, availing myself of a ditch for the greater part of the way,succeeded in crawling, unobserved by these monstrous machines, intothe pine woods towards Maybury.Under cover of this I pushed on, wet and shivering now, towards myown house.  I walked among the trees trying to find the footpath.  Itwas very dark indeed in the wood, for the lightning was now becominginfrequent, and the hail, which was pouring down in a torrent, fell incolumns through the gaps in the heavy foliage.If I had fully realised the meaning of all the things I had seen Ishould have immediately worked my way round through Byfleet to StreetCobham, and so gone back to rejoin my wife at Leatherhead.  But thatnight the strangeness of things about me, and my physicalwretchedness, prevented me, for I was bruised, weary, wet to the skin,deafened and blinded by the storm.I had a vague idea of going on to my own house, and that was asmuch motive as I had.  I staggered through the trees, fell into aditch and bruised my knees against a plank, and finally splashed outinto the lane that ran down from the College Arms.  I say splashed,for the storm water was sweeping the sand down the hill in a muddytorrent.  There in the darkness a man blundered into me and sent mereeling back.He gave a cry of terror, sprang sideways, and rushed on before Icould gather my wits sufficiently to speak to him.  So heavy was thestress of the storm just at this place that I had the hardest task towin my way up the hill.  I went close up to the fence on the left andworked my way along its palings.Near the top I stumbled upon something soft, and, by a flash oflightning, saw between my feet a heap of black broadcloth and a pairof boots.  Before I could distinguish clearly how the man lay, theflicker of light had passed.  I stood over him waiting for the nextflash.  When it came, I saw that he was a sturdy man, cheaply but notshabbily dressed; his head was bent under his body, and he laycrumpled up close to the fence, as though he had been flung violentlyagainst it.Overcoming the repugnance natural to one who had never beforetouched a dead body, I stooped and turned him over to feel for hisheart.  He was quite dead.  Apparently his neck had been broken.  Thelightning flashed for a third time, and his face leaped upon me.  Isprang to my feet.  It was the landlord of the Spotted Dog, whoseconveyance I had taken.I stepped over him gingerly and pushed on up the hill.  I made myway by the police station and the College Arms towards my own house.Nothing was burning on the hillside, though from the common therestill came a red glare and a rolling tumult of ruddy smoke beating upagainst the drenching hail.  So far as I could see by the flashes, thehouses about me were mostly uninjured.  By the College Arms a darkheap lay in the road.Down the road towards Maybury Bridge there were voices and thesound of feet, but I had not the courage to shout or to go to them.  Ilet myself in with my latchkey, closed, locked and bolted the door,staggered to the foot of the staircase, and sat down.  My imaginationwas full of those striding metallic monsters, and of the dead bodysmashed against the fence.I crouched at the foot of the staircase with my back to the wall,shivering violently.CHAPTER ELEVENAT THE WINDOWI have already said that my storms of emotion have a trick ofexhausting themselves.  After a time I discovered that I was cold andwet, and with little pools of water about me on the stair carpet.  Igot up almost mechanically, went into the dining room and drank somewhiskey, and then I was moved to change my clothes.After I had done that I went upstairs to my study, but why I did soI do not know.  The window of my study looks over the trees and therailway towards Horsell Common.  In the hurry of our departure thiswindow had been left open.  The passage was dark, and, by contrast withthe picture the window frame enclosed, the side of the room seemedimpenetrably dark.  I stopped short in the doorway.The thunderstorm had passed.  The towers of the Oriental Collegeand the pine trees about it had gone, and very far away, lit by avivid red glare, the common about the sand pits was visible.  Acrossthe light huge black shapes, grotesque and strange, moved busily toand fro.It seemed indeed as if the whole country in that direction was onfire--a broad hillside set with minute tongues of flame, swaying andwrithing with the gusts of the dying storm, and throwing a redreflection upon the cloud-scud above.  Every now and then a haze ofsmoke from some nearer conflagration drove across the window and hidthe Martian shapes.  I could not see what they were doing, nor theclear form of them, nor recognise the black objects they were busiedupon.  Neither could I see the nearer fire, though the reflections ofit danced on the wall and ceiling of the study.  A sharp, resinoustang of burning was in the air.I closed the door noiselessly and crept towards the window.  As Idid so, the view opened out until, on the one hand, it reached to thehouses about Woking station, and on the other to the charred andblackened pine woods of Byfleet.  There was a light down below thehill, on the railway, near the arch, and several of the houses alongthe Maybury road and the streets near the station were glowing ruins.The light upon the railway puzzled me at first; there were a blackheap and a vivid glare, and to the right of that a row of yellowoblongs.  Then I perceived this was a wrecked train, the fore partsmashed and on fire, the hinder carriages still upon the rails.Between these three main centres of light--the houses, the train,and the burning county towards Chobham--stretched irregular patches ofdark country, broken here and there by intervals of dimly glowing andsmoking ground.  It was the strangest spectacle, that black expanse setwith fire.  It reminded me, more than anything else, of the Potteriesat night.  At first I could distinguish no people at all, though Ipeered intently for them.  Later I saw against the light of Wokingstation a number of black figures hurrying one after the other acrossthe line.And this was the little world in which I had been living securelyfor years, this fiery chaos!  What had happened in the last sevenhours I still did not know; nor did I know, though I was beginning toguess, the relation between these mechanical colossi and the sluggishlumps I had seen disgorged from the cylinder.  With a queer feeling ofimpersonal interest I turned my desk chair to the window, sat down,and stared at the blackened country, and particularly at the threegigantic black things that were going to and fro in the glare aboutthe sand pits.They seemed amazingly busy.  I began to ask myself what they couldbe.  Were they intelligent mechanisms?  Such a thing I felt wasimpossible.  Or did a Martian sit within each, ruling, directing,using, much as a man's brain sits and rules in his body?  I began tocompare the things to human machines, to ask myself for the first timein my life how an ironclad or a steam engine would seem to anintelligent lower animal.The storm had left the sky clear, and over the smoke of the burningland the little fading pinpoint of Mars was dropping into the west,when a soldier came into my garden.  I heard a slight scraping at thefence, and rousing myself from the lethargy that had fallen upon me, Ilooked down and saw him dimly, clambering over the palings.  At thesight of another human being my torpor passed, and I leaned out of thewindow eagerly.&quot;Hist!&quot; said I, in a whisper.He stopped astride of the fence in doubt.  Then he came over andacross the lawn to the corner of the house.  He bent down and steppedsoftly.&quot;Who's there?&quot; he said, also whispering, standing under the windowand peering up.&quot;Where are you going?&quot; I asked.&quot;God knows.&quot;&quot;Are you trying to hide?&quot;&quot;That's it.&quot;&quot;Come into the house,&quot; I said.I went down, unfastened the door, and let him in, and locked thedoor again.  I could not see his face.  He was hatless, and his coatwas unbuttoned.&quot;My God!&quot; he said, as I drew him in.&quot;What has happened?&quot; I asked.&quot;What hasn't?&quot;  In the obscurity I could see he made a gesture ofdespair.  &quot;They wiped us out--simply wiped us out,&quot; he repeated againand again.He followed me, almost mechanically, into the dining room.&quot;Take some whiskey,&quot; I said, pouring out a stiff dose.He drank it.  Then abruptly he sat down before the table, put hishead on his arms, and began to sob and weep like a little boy, in aperfect passion of emotion, while I, with a curious forgetfulness ofmy own recent despair, stood beside him, wondering.It was a long time before he could steady his nerves to answer myquestions, and then he answered perplexingly and brokenly.  He was adriver in the artillery, and had only come into action about seven.  Atthat time firing was going on across the common, and it was said thefirst party of Martians were crawling slowly towards their secondcylinder under cover of a metal shield.Later this shield staggered up on tripod legs and became the firstof the fighting-machines I had seen.  The gun he drove had beenunlimbered near Horsell, in order to command the sand pits, and itsarrival it was that had precipitated the action.  As the limbergunners went to the rear, his horse trod in a rabbit hole and camedown, throwing him into a depression of the ground.  At the samemoment the gun exploded behind him, the ammunition blew up, there wasfire all about him, and he found himself lying under a heap of charreddead men and dead horses.&quot;I lay still,&quot; he said, &quot;scared out of my wits, with the fore quarterof a horse atop of me.  We'd been wiped out.  And the smell--goodGod!  Like burnt meat!  I was hurt across the back by the fall ofthe horse, and there I had to lie until I felt better.  Just likeparade it had been a minute before--then stumble, bang, swish!&quot;&quot;Wiped out!&quot; he said.He had hid under the dead horse for a long time, peeping outfurtively across the common.  The Cardigan men had tried a rush, inskirmishing order, at the pit, simply to be swept out of existence.Then the monster had risen to its feet and had begun to walk leisurelyto and fro across the common among the few fugitives, with itsheadlike hood turning about exactly like the head of a cowled humanbeing.  A kind of arm carried a complicated metallic case, about whichgreen flashes scintillated, and out of the funnel of this there smokedthe Heat-Ray.In a few minutes there was, so far as the soldier could see, not aliving thing left upon the common, and every bush and tree upon itthat was not already a blackened skeleton was burning.  The hussarshad been on the road beyond the curvature of the ground, and he sawnothing of them.  He heard the Martians rattle for a time and thenbecome still.  The giant saved Woking station and its cluster of housesuntil the last; then in a moment the Heat-Ray was brought to bear, andthe town became a heap of fiery ruins.  Then the Thing shut off theHeat-Ray, and turning its back upon the artilleryman, began to waddleaway towards the smouldering pine woods that sheltered the secondcylinder.  As it did so a second glittering Titan built itself up outof the pit.The second monster followed the first, and at that the artillerymanbegan to crawl very cautiously across the hot heather ash towardsHorsell.  He managed to get alive into the ditch by the side of theroad, and so escaped to Woking.  There his story became ejaculatory.The place was impassable.  It seems there were a few people alivethere, frantic for the most part and many burned and scalded.  He wasturned aside by the fire, and hid among some almost scorching heaps ofbroken wall as one of the Martian giants returned.  He saw this onepursue a man, catch him up in one of its steely tentacles, and knockhis head against the trunk of a pine tree.  At last, after nightfall,the artilleryman made a rush for it and got over the railwayembankment.Since then he had been skulking along towards Maybury, in the hopeof getting out of danger Londonward.  People were hiding in trenchesand cellars, and many of the survivors had made off towards Wokingvillage and Send.  He had been consumed with thirst until he found oneof the water mains near the railway arch smashed, and the waterbubbling out like a spring upon the road.That was the story I got from him, bit by bit.  He grew calmertelling me and trying to make me see the things he had seen.  He hadeaten no food since midday, he told me early in his narrative, and Ifound some mutton and bread in the pantry and brought it into theroom.  We lit no lamp for fear of attracting the Martians, and everand again our hands would touch upon bread or meat.  As he talked,things about us came darkly out of the darkness, and the trampledbushes and broken rose trees outside the window grew distinct.  Itwould seem that a number of men or animals had rushed across the lawn.I began to see his face, blackened and haggard, as no doubt mine wasalso.When we had finished eating we went softly upstairs to my study,and I looked again out of the open window.  In one night the valleyhad become a valley of ashes.  The fires had dwindled now.  Whereflames had been there were now streamers of smoke; but the countlessruins of shattered and gutted houses and blasted and blackened treesthat the night had hidden stood out now gaunt and terrible in thepitiless light of dawn.  Yet here and there some object had had theluck to escape--a white railway signal here, the end of a greenhousethere, white and fresh amid the wreckage.  Never before in the historyof warfare had destruction been so indiscriminate and so universal.And shining with the growing light of the east, three of the metallicgiants stood about the pit, their cowls rotating as though they weresurveying the desolation they had made.It seemed to me that the pit had been enlarged, and ever and againpuffs of vivid green vapour streamed up and out of it towards thebrightening dawn--streamed up, whirled, broke, and vanished.Beyond were the pillars of fire about Chobham.  They became pillarsof bloodshot smoke at the first touch of day.CHAPTER TWELVEWHAT I SAW OF THE DESTRUCTION OF WEYBRIDGE AND SHEPPERTONAs the dawn grew brighter we withdrew from the window from which wehad watched the Martians, and went very quietly downstairs.The artilleryman agreed with me that the house was no place to stayin.  He proposed, he said, to make his way Londonward, and thencerejoin his battery--No. 12, of the Horse Artillery.  My plan was toreturn at once to Leatherhead; and so greatly had the strength of theMartians impressed me that I had determined to take my wife toNewhaven, and go with her out of the country forthwith.  For I alreadyperceived clearly that the country about London must inevitably be thescene of a disastrous struggle before such creatures as these could bedestroyed.Between us and Leatherhead, however, lay the third cylinder, withits guarding giants.  Had I been alone, I think I should have taken mychance and struck across country.  But the artilleryman dissuaded me:&quot;It's no kindness to the right sort of wife,&quot; he said, &quot;to make her awidow&quot;; and in the end I agreed to go with him, under cover of thewoods, northward as far as Street Cobham before I parted with him.Thence I would make a big detour by Epsom to reach Leatherhead.I should have started at once, but my companion had been in activeservice and he knew better than that.  He made me ransack the housefor a flask, which he filled with whiskey; and we lined everyavailable pocket with packets of biscuits and slices of meat.  Thenwe crept out of the house, and ran as quickly as we could down theill-made road by which I had come overnight.  The houses seemeddeserted. In the road lay a group of three charred bodies closetogether, struck dead by the Heat-Ray; and here and there were thingsthat people had dropped--a clock, a slipper, a silver spoon, and thelike poor valuables.  At the corner turning up towards the postoffice a little cart, filled with boxes and furniture, and horseless,heeled over on a broken wheel.  A cash box had been hastily smashedopen and thrown under the debris.Except the lodge at the Orphanage, which was still on fire, none ofthe houses had suffered very greatly here.  The Heat-Ray had shavedthe chimney tops and passed.  Yet, save ourselves, there did not seemto be a living soul on Maybury Hill.  The majority of the inhabitantshad escaped, I suppose, by way of the Old Woking road--the road I hadtaken when I drove to Leatherhead--or they had hidden.We went down the lane, by the body of the man in black, sodden nowfrom the overnight hail, and broke into the woods at the foot of thehill.  We pushed through these towards the railway without meeting asoul.  The woods across the line were but the scarred and blackenedruins of woods; for the most part the trees had fallen, but a certainproportion still stood, dismal grey stems, with dark brown foliageinstead of green.On our side the fire had done no more than scorch the nearer trees;it had failed to secure its footing.  In one place the woodmen hadbeen at work on Saturday; trees, felled and freshly trimmed, lay in aclearing, with heaps of sawdust by the sawing-machine and its engine.Hard by was a temporary hut, deserted.  There was not a breath of windthis morning, and everything was strangely still.  Even the birds werehushed, and as we hurried along I and the artilleryman talked inwhispers and looked now and again over our shoulders.  Once or twicewe stopped to listen.After a time we drew near the road, and as we did so we heard theclatter of hoofs and saw through the tree stems three cavalry soldiersriding slowly towards Woking.  We hailed them, and they halted whilewe hurried towards them.  It was a lieutenant and a couple of privatesof the 8th Hussars, with a stand like a theodolite, which theartilleryman told me was a heliograph.&quot;You are the first men I've seen coming this way this morning,&quot;said the lieutenant.  &quot;What's brewing?&quot;His voice and face were eager.  The men behind him staredcuriously.  The artilleryman jumped down the bank into the road andsaluted.&quot;Gun destroyed last night, sir.  Have been hiding.  Trying torejoin battery, sir.  You'll come in sight of the Martians, I expect,about half a mile along this road.&quot;&quot;What the dickens are they like?&quot; asked the lieutenant.&quot;Giants in armour, sir.  Hundred feet high.  Three legs and a bodylike 'luminium, with a mighty great head in a hood, sir.&quot;&quot;Get out!&quot; said the lieutenant.  &quot;What confounded nonsense!&quot;&quot;You'll see, sir.  They carry a kind of box, sir, that shoots fireand strikes you dead.&quot;&quot;What d'ye mean--a gun?&quot;&quot;No, sir,&quot; and the artilleryman began a vivid account of the Heat-Ray.Halfway through, the lieutenant interrupted him and looked up atme.  I was still standing on the bank by the side of the road.&quot;It's perfectly true,&quot; I said.&quot;Well,&quot; said the lieutenant, &quot;I suppose it's my business to see ittoo.  Look here&quot;--to the artilleryman--&quot;we're detailed here clearingpeople out of their houses.  You'd better go along and report yourselfto Brigadier-General Marvin, and tell him all you know.  He's atWeybridge.  Know the way?&quot;&quot;I do,&quot; I said; and he turned his horse southward again.&quot;Half a mile, you say?&quot; said he.&quot;At most,&quot; I answered, and pointed over the treetops southward.  Hethanked me and rode on, and we saw them no more.Farther along we came upon a group of three women and two childrenin the road, busy clearing out a labourer's cottage.  They hadgot hold of a little hand truck, and were piling it up withunclean-looking bundles and shabby furniture.  They were all tooassiduously engaged to talk to us as we passed.By Byfleet station we emerged from the pine trees, and found thecountry calm and peaceful under the morning sunlight.  We were farbeyond the range of the Heat-Ray there, and had it not been for thesilent desertion of some of the houses, the stirring movement ofpacking in others, and the knot of soldiers standing on the bridgeover the railway and staring down the line towards Woking, the daywould have seemed very like any other Sunday.Several farm waggons and carts were moving creakily along the roadto Addlestone, and suddenly through the gate of a field we saw, acrossa stretch of flat meadow, six twelve-pounders standing neatly at equaldistances pointing towards Woking.  The gunners stood by the gunswaiting, and the ammunition waggons were at a business-like distance.The men stood almost as if under inspection.&quot;That's good!&quot; said I.  &quot;They will get one fair shot, at any rate.&quot;The artilleryman hesitated at the gate.&quot;I shall go on,&quot; he said.Farther on towards Weybridge, just over the bridge, there were anumber of men in white fatigue jackets throwing up a long rampart, andmore guns behind.&quot;It's bows and arrows against the lightning, anyhow,&quot; said theartilleryman.  &quot;They 'aven't seen that fire-beam yet.&quot;The officers who were not actively engaged stood and stared overthe treetops southwestward, and the men digging would stop every nowand again to stare in the same direction.Byfleet was in a tumult; people packing, and a score of hussars,some of them dismounted, some on horseback, were hunting them about.Three or four black government waggons, with crosses in white circles,and an old omnibus, among other vehicles, were being loaded in thevillage street.  There were scores of people, most of themsufficiently sabbatical to have assumed their best clothes.  Thesoldiers were having the greatest difficulty in making them realisethe gravity of their position.  We saw one shrivelled old fellow witha huge box and a score or more of flower pots containing orchids,angrily expostulating with the corporal who would leave them behind.I stopped and gripped his arm.&quot;Do you know what's over there?&quot; I said, pointing at the pine topsthat hid the Martians.&quot;Eh?&quot; said he, turning.  &quot;I was explainin' these is vallyble.&quot;&quot;Death!&quot; I shouted.  &quot;Death is coming!  Death!&quot; and leaving him todigest that if he could, I hurried on after the artillery-man.  At thecorner I looked back.  The soldier had left him, and he was stillstanding by his box, with the pots of orchids on the lid of it, andstaring vaguely over the trees.No one in Weybridge could tell us where the headquarters wereestablished; the whole place was in such confusion as I had never seenin any town before.  Carts, carriages everywhere, the most astonishingmiscellany of conveyances and horseflesh.  The respectable inhabitantsof the place, men in golf and boating costumes, wives prettilydressed, were packing, river-side loafers energetically helping,children excited, and, for the most part, highly delighted at thisastonishing variation of their Sunday experiences.  In the midst of itall the worthy vicar was very pluckily holding an early celebration,and his bell was jangling out above the excitement.I and the artilleryman, seated on the step of the drinkingfountain, made a very passable meal upon what we had brought withus. Patrols of soldiers--here no longer hussars, but grenadiers inwhite--were warning people to move now or to take refuge in theircellars as soon as the firing began.  We saw as we crossed therailway bridge that a growing crowd of people had assembled in andabout the railway station, and the swarming platform was piled withboxes and packages. The ordinary traffic had been stopped, I believe,in order to allow of the passage of troops and guns to Chertsey, andI have heard since that a savage struggle occurred for places in thespecial trains that were put on at a later hour.We remained at Weybridge until midday, and at that hour we foundourselves at the place near Shepperton Lock where the Wey and Thamesjoin.  Part of the time we spent helping two old women to pack alittle cart.  The Wey has a treble mouth, and at this point boats areto be hired, and there was a ferry across the river.  On theShepperton side was an inn with a lawn, and beyond that the tower ofShepperton Church--it has been replaced by a spire--rose above thetrees.Here we found an excited and noisy crowd of fugitives.  As yet theflight had not grown to a panic, but there were already far morepeople than all the boats going to and fro could enable to cross.People came panting along under heavy burdens; one husband and wifewere even carrying a small outhouse door between them, with some oftheir household goods piled thereon.  One man told us he meant to tryto get away from Shepperton station.There was a lot of shouting, and one man was even jesting.  The ideapeople seemed to have here was that the Martians were simplyformidable human beings, who might attack and sack the town, to becertainly destroyed in the end.  Every now and then people wouldglance nervously across the Wey, at the meadows towards Chertsey, buteverything over there was still.Across the Thames, except just where the boats landed, everythingwas quiet, in vivid contrast with the Surrey side.  The people wholanded there from the boats went tramping off down the lane.  The bigferryboat had just made a journey.  Three or four soldiers stood onthe lawn of the inn, staring and jesting at the fugitives, withoutoffering to help.  The inn was closed, as it was now within prohibitedhours.&quot;What's that?&quot; cried a boatman, and &quot;Shut up, you fool!&quot; said a mannear me to a yelping dog.  Then the sound came again, this time fromthe direction of Chertsey, a muffled thud--the sound of a gun.The fighting was beginning.  Almost immediately unseen batteriesacross the river to our right, unseen because of the trees, took upthe chorus, firing heavily one after the other.  A woman screamed.Everyone stood arrested by the sudden stir of battle, near us and yetinvisible to us.  Nothing was to be seen save flat meadows, cowsfeeding unconcernedly for the most part, and silvery pollard willowsmotionless in the warm sunlight.&quot;The sojers'll stop 'em,&quot; said a woman beside me, doubtfully.  Ahaziness rose over the treetops.Then suddenly we saw a rush of smoke far away up the river, a puffof smoke that jerked up into the air and hung; and forthwith theground heaved under foot and a heavy explosion shook the air, smashingtwo or three windows in the houses near, and leaving us astonished.&quot;Here they are!&quot; shouted a man in a blue jersey.  &quot;Yonder! D'yersee them?  Yonder!&quot;Quickly, one after the other, one, two, three, four of the armouredMartians appeared, far away over the little trees, across the flatmeadows that stretched towards Chertsey, and striding hurriedlytowards the river.  Little cowled figures they seemed at first, goingwith a rolling motion and as fast as flying birds.Then, advancing obliquely towards us, came a fifth.  Their armouredbodies glittered in the sun as they swept swiftly forward upon theguns, growing rapidly larger as they drew nearer.  One on the extremeleft, the remotest that is, flourished a huge case high in the air,and the ghostly, terrible Heat-Ray I had already seen on Friday nightsmote towards Chertsey, and struck the town.At sight of these strange, swift, and terrible creatures the crowdnear the water's edge seemed to me to be for a moment horror-struck.There was no screaming or shouting, but a silence.  Then a hoarsemurmur and a movement of feet--a splashing from the water.  A man, toofrightened to drop the portmanteau he carried on his shoulder, swunground and sent me staggering with a blow from the corner of hisburden.  A woman thrust at me with her hand and rushed past me.  Iturned with the rush of the people, but I was not too terrified forthought.  The terrible Heat-Ray was in my mind.  To get under water!That was it!&quot;Get under water!&quot; I shouted, unheeded.I faced about again, and rushed towards the approaching Martian,rushed right down the gravelly beach and headlong into the water.Others did the same.  A boatload of people putting back came leapingout as I rushed past.  The stones under my feet were muddy andslippery, and the river was so low that I ran perhaps twenty feetscarcely waist-deep.  Then, as the Martian towered overhead scarcelya couple of hundred yards away, I flung myself forward under thesurface.  The splashes of the people in the boats leaping into theriver sounded like thunderclaps in my ears.  People were landinghastily on both sides of the river.  But the Martian machine took nomore notice for the moment of the people running this way and thatthan a man would of the confusion of ants in a nest against which hisfoot has kicked.  When, half suffocated, I raised my head above water,the Martian's hood pointed at the batteries that were still firingacross the river, and as it advanced it swung loose what must havebeen the generator of the Heat-Ray.In another moment it was on the bank, and in a stride wadinghalfway across.  The knees of its foremost legs bent at the fartherbank, and in another moment it had raised itself to its full heightagain, close to the village of Shepperton.  Forthwith the six gunswhich, unknown to anyone on the right bank, had been hidden behind theoutskirts of that village, fired simultaneously.  The sudden nearconcussion, the last close upon the first, made my heart jump.  Themonster was already raising the case generating the Heat-Ray as thefirst shell burst six yards above the hood.I gave a cry of astonishment.  I saw and thought nothing of theother four Martian monsters; my attention was riveted upon the nearerincident.  Simultaneously two other shells burst in the air near thebody as the hood twisted round in time to receive, but not in time tododge, the fourth shell.The shell burst clean in the face of the Thing.  The hood bulged,flashed, was whirled off in a dozen tattered fragments of red fleshand glittering metal.&quot;Hit!&quot; shouted I, with something between a scream and a cheer.I heard answering shouts from the people in the water about me.  Icould have leaped out of the water with that momentary exultation.The decapitated colossus reeled like a drunken giant; but it didnot fall over.  It recovered its balance by a miracle, and, no longerheeding its steps and with the camera that fired the Heat-Ray nowrigidly upheld, it reeled swiftly upon Shepperton.  The livingintelligence, the Martian within the hood, was slain and splashed tothe four winds of heaven, and the Thing was now but a mere intricatedevice of metal whirling to destruction.  It drove along in a straightline, incapable of guidance.  It struck the tower of SheppertonChurch, smashing it down as the impact of a battering ram might havedone, swerved aside, blundered on and collapsed with tremendous forceinto the river out of my sight.A violent explosion shook the air, and a spout of water, steam,mud, and shattered metal shot far up into the sky.  As the camera ofthe Heat-Ray hit the water, the latter had immediately flashed intosteam.  In another moment a huge wave, like a muddy tidal bore butalmost scaldingly hot, came sweeping round the bend upstream.  I sawpeople struggling shorewards, and heard their screaming and shoutingfaintly above the seething and roar of the Martian's collapse.For a moment I heeded nothing of the heat, forgot the patent needof self-preservation.  I splashed through the tumultuous water,pushing aside a man in black to do so, until I could see round thebend.  Half a dozen deserted boats pitched aimlessly upon theconfusion of the waves.  The fallen Martian came into sightdownstream, lying across the river, and for the most part submerged.Thick clouds of steam were pouring off the wreckage, and throughthe tumultuously whirling wisps I could see, intermittently andvaguely, the gigantic limbs churning the water and flinging a splashand spray of mud and froth into the air.  The tentacles swayed andstruck like living arms, and, save for the helpless purposelessness ofthese movements, it was as if some wounded thing were struggling forits life amid the waves.  Enormous quantities of a ruddy-brown fluidwere spurting up in noisy jets out of the machine.My attention was diverted from this death flurry by a furiousyelling, like that of the thing called a siren in our manufacturingtowns.  A man, knee-deep near the towing path, shouted inaudibly to meand pointed.  Looking back, I saw the other Martians advancing withgigantic strides down the riverbank from the direction of Chertsey.The Shepperton guns spoke this time unavailingly.At that I ducked at once under water, and, holding my breath untilmovement was an agony, blundered painfully ahead under the surface aslong as I could.  The water was in a tumult about me, and rapidlygrowing hotter.When for a moment I raised my head to take breath and throw thehair and water from my eyes, the steam was rising in a whirling whitefog that at first hid the Martians altogether.  The noise wasdeafening.  Then I saw them dimly, colossal figures of grey, magnifiedby the mist.  They had passed by me, and two were stooping over thefrothing, tumultuous ruins of their comrade.The third and fourth stood beside him in the water, one perhaps twohundred yards from me, the other towards Laleham.  The generators ofthe Heat-Rays waved high, and the hissing beams smote down this wayand that.The air was full of sound, a deafening and confusing conflict ofnoises--the clangorous din of the Martians, the crash of fallinghouses, the thud of trees, fences, sheds flashing into flame, and thecrackling and roaring of fire.  Dense black smoke was leaping up tomingle with the steam from the river, and as the Heat-Ray went to andfro over Weybridge its impact was marked by flashes of incandescentwhite, that gave place at once to a smoky dance of lurid flames.  Thenearer houses still stood intact, awaiting their fate, shadowy, faintand pallid in the steam, with the fire behind them going to and fro.For a moment perhaps I stood there, breast-high in the almostboiling water, dumbfounded at my position, hopeless of escape.  Throughthe reek I could see the people who had been with me in the riverscrambling out of the water through the reeds, like little frogshurrying through grass from the advance of a man, or running to andfro in utter dismay on the towing path.Then suddenly the white flashes of the Heat-Ray came leapingtowards me.  The houses caved in as they dissolved at its touch, anddarted out flames; the trees changed to fire with a roar.  The Rayflickered up and down the towing path, licking off the people who ranthis way and that, and came down to the water's edge not fifty yardsfrom where I stood.  It swept across the river to Shepperton, and thewater in its track rose in a boiling weal crested with steam.  Iturned shoreward.In another moment the huge wave, well-nigh at the boiling-point hadrushed upon me.  I screamed aloud, and scalded, half blinded,agonised, I staggered through the leaping, hissing water towards theshore.  Had my foot stumbled, it would have been the end.  I fellhelplessly, in full sight of the Martians, upon the broad, baregravelly spit that runs down to mark the angle of the Wey and Thames.I expected nothing but death.I have a dim memory of the foot of a Martian coming down within ascore of yards of my head, driving straight into the loose gravel,whirling it this way and that and lifting again; of a long suspense,and then of the four carrying the debris of their comrade betweenthem, now clear and then presently faint through a veil of smoke,receding interminably, as it seemed to me, across a vast space ofriver and meadow.  And then, very slowly, I realised that by a miracleI had escaped.CHAPTER THIRTEENHOW I FELL IN WITH THE CURATEAfter getting this sudden lesson in the power of terrestrialweapons, the Martians retreated to their original position uponHorsell Common; and in their haste, and encumbered with the debris oftheir smashed companion, they no doubt overlooked many such a strayand negligible victim as myself.  Had they left their comrade andpushed on forthwith, there was nothing at that time between them andLondon but batteries of twelve-pounder guns, and they would certainlyhave reached the capital in advance of the tidings of their approach;as sudden, dreadful, and destructive their advent would have been asthe earthquake that destroyed Lisbon a century ago.But they were in no hurry.  Cylinder followed cylinder on itsinterplanetary flight; every twenty-four hours brought themreinforcement.  And meanwhile the military and naval authorities, nowfully alive to the tremendous power of their antagonists, worked withfurious energy.  Every minute a fresh gun came into position until,before twilight, every copse, every row of suburban villas on thehilly slopes about Kingston and Richmond, masked an expectant blackmuzzle.  And through the charred and desolated area--perhaps twentysquare miles altogether--that encircled the Martian encampment onHorsell Common, through charred and ruined villages among the greentrees, through the blackened and smoking arcades that had been but aday ago pine spinneys, crawled the devoted scouts with the heliographsthat were presently to warn the gunners of the Martian approach.  Butthe Martians now understood our command of artillery and the danger ofhuman proximity, and not a man ventured within a mile of eithercylinder, save at the price of his life.It would seem that these giants spent the earlier part of theafternoon in going to and fro, transferring everything from the secondand third cylinders--the second in Addlestone Golf Links and the thirdat Pyrford--to their original pit on Horsell Common.  Over that, abovethe blackened heather and ruined buildings that stretched far andwide, stood one as sentinel, while the rest abandoned their vastfighting-machines and descended into the pit.  They were hard at workthere far into the night, and the towering pillar of dense green smokethat rose therefrom could be seen from the hills about Merrow, andeven, it is said, from Banstead and Epsom Downs.And while the Martians behind me were thus preparing for their nextsally, and in front of me Humanity gathered for the battle, I made myway with infinite pains and labour from the fire and smoke of burningWeybridge towards London.I saw an abandoned boat, very small and remote, drifting down-stream;and throwing off the most of my sodden clothes, I went after it,gained it, and so escaped out of that destruction.  There were nooars in the boat, but I contrived to paddle, as well as my parboiledhands would allow, down the river towards Halliford and Walton, goingvery tediously and continually looking behind me, as you may wellunderstand.  I followed the river, because I considered that the watergave me my best chance of escape should these giants return.The hot water from the Martian's overthrow drifted downstream withme, so that for the best part of a mile I could see little of eitherbank.  Once, however, I made out a string of black figures hurryingacross the meadows from the direction of Weybridge.  Halliford, itseemed, was deserted, and several of the houses facing the river wereon fire.  It was strange to see the place quite tranquil, quitedesolate under the hot blue sky, with the smoke and little threads offlame going straight up into the heat of the afternoon.  Never beforehad I seen houses burning without the accompaniment of an obstructivecrowd.  A little farther on the dry reeds up the bank were smoking andglowing, and a line of fire inland was marching steadily across a latefield of hay.For a long time I drifted, so painful and weary was I after theviolence I had been through, and so intense the heat upon the water.Then my fears got the better of me again, and I resumed my paddling.The sun scorched my bare back.  At last, as the bridge at Walton wascoming into sight round the bend, my fever and faintness overcame myfears, and I landed on the Middlesex bank and lay down, deadly sick,amid the long grass.  I suppose the time was then about four or fiveo'clock.  I got up presently, walked perhaps half a mile withoutmeeting a soul, and then lay down again in the shadow of a hedge.  Iseem to remember talking, wanderingly, to myself during that lastspurt.  I was also very thirsty, and bitterly regretful I had drunk nomore water.  It is a curious thing that I felt angry with my wife; Icannot account for it, but my impotent desire to reach Leatherheadworried me excessively.I do not clearly remember the arrival of the curate, so that probablyI dozed.  I became aware of him as a seated figure in soot-smudgedshirt sleeves, and with his upturned, clean-shaven face staring ata faint flickering that danced over the sky.  The sky was what iscalled a mackerel sky--rows and rows of faint down-plumes ofcloud, just tinted with the midsummer sunset.I sat up, and at the rustle of my motion he looked at me quickly.&quot;Have you any water?&quot; I asked abruptly.He shook his head.&quot;You have been asking for water for the last hour,&quot; he said.For a moment we were silent, taking stock of each other.  Idare say he found me a strange enough figure, naked, save for mywater-soaked trousers and socks, scalded, and my face and shouldersblackened by the smoke.  His face was a fair weakness, his chinretreated, and his hair lay in crisp, almost flaxen curls on his lowforehead; his eyes were rather large, pale blue, and blankly staring.He spoke abruptly, looking vacantly away from me.&quot;What does it mean?&quot; he said.  &quot;What do these things mean?&quot;I stared at him and made no answer.He extended a thin white hand and spoke in almost a complainingtone.&quot;Why are these things permitted?  What sins have we done?  Themorning service was over, I was walking through the roads to clear mybrain for the afternoon, and then--fire, earthquake, death!  As if itwere Sodom and Gomorrah!  All our work undone, all the work---- Whatare these Martians?&quot;&quot;What are we?&quot; I answered, clearing my throat.He gripped his knees and turned to look at me again.  For half aminute, perhaps, he stared silently.&quot;I was walking through the roads to clear my brain,&quot; he said.  &quot;Andsuddenly--fire, earthquake, death!&quot;He relapsed into silence, with his chin now sunken almost to hisknees.Presently he began waving his hand.&quot;All the work--all the Sunday schools--What have we done--what hasWeybridge done?  Everything gone--everything destroyed.  The church!We rebuilt it only three years ago.  Gone!  Swept out of existence!Why?&quot;Another pause, and he broke out again like one demented.&quot;The smoke of her burning goeth up for ever and ever!&quot; he shouted.His eyes flamed, and he pointed a lean finger in the direction ofWeybridge.By this time I was beginning to take his measure.  The tremendoustragedy in which he had been involved--it was evident he was afugitive from Weybridge--had driven him to the very verge of hisreason.&quot;Are we far from Sunbury?&quot; I said, in a matter-of-fact tone.&quot;What are we to do?&quot; he asked.  &quot;Are these creatures everywhere?Has the earth been given over to them?&quot;&quot;Are we far from Sunbury?&quot;&quot;Only this morning I officiated at early celebration----&quot;&quot;Things have changed,&quot; I said, quietly.  &quot;You must keep your head.There is still hope.&quot;&quot;Hope!&quot;&quot;Yes.  Plentiful hope--for all this destruction!&quot;I began to explain my view of our position.  He listened at first,but as I went on the interest dawning in his eyes gave place to theirformer stare, and his regard wandered from me.&quot;This must be the beginning of the end,&quot; he said, interrupting me.&quot;The end!  The great and terrible day of the Lord!  When men shallcall upon the mountains and the rocks to fall upon them and hidethem--hide them from the face of Him that sitteth upon the throne!&quot;I began to understand the position.  I ceased my labouredreasoning, struggled to my feet, and, standing over him, laid my handon his shoulder.&quot;Be a man!&quot; said I.  &quot;You are scared out of your wits!  What goodis religion if it collapses under calamity?  Think of what earthquakesand floods, wars and volcanoes, have done before to men!  Did youthink God had exempted Weybridge?  He is not an insurance agent.&quot;For a time he sat in blank silence.&quot;But how can we escape?&quot; he asked, suddenly.  &quot;They areinvulnerable, they are pitiless.&quot;&quot;Neither the one nor, perhaps, the other,&quot; I answered. &quot;And themightier they are the more sane and wary should we be.  One of themwas killed yonder not three hours ago.&quot;&quot;Killed!&quot; he said, staring about him.  &quot;How can God's ministers bekilled?&quot;&quot;I saw it happen.&quot; I proceeded to tell him.  &quot;We have chanced tocome in for the thick of it,&quot; said I, &quot;and that is all.&quot;&quot;What is that flicker in the sky?&quot; he asked abruptly.I told him it was the heliograph signalling--that it was the signof human help and effort in the sky.&quot;We are in the midst of it,&quot; I said, &quot;quiet as it is.  That flickerin the sky tells of the gathering storm.  Yonder, I take it are theMartians, and Londonward, where those hills rise about Richmond andKingston and the trees give cover, earthworks are being thrown up andguns are being placed.  Presently the Martians will be coming this wayagain.&quot;And even as I spoke he sprang to his feet and stopped me by agesture.&quot;Listen!&quot; he said.From beyond the low hills across the water came the dull resonanceof distant guns and a remote weird crying.  Then everything was still.A cockchafer came droning over the hedge and past us.  High in thewest the crescent moon hung faint and pale above the smoke ofWeybridge and Shepperton and the hot, still splendour of the sunset.&quot;We had better follow this path,&quot; I said, &quot;northward.&quot;CHAPTER FOURTEENIN LONDONMy younger brother was in London when the Martians fell at Woking.He was a medical student working for an imminent examination, and heheard nothing of the arrival until Saturday morning.  The morningpapers on Saturday contained, in addition to lengthy special articleson the planet Mars, on life in the planets, and so forth, a brief andvaguely worded telegram, all the more striking for its brevity.The Martians, alarmed by the approach of a crowd, had killed anumber of people with a quick-firing gun, so the story ran.  Thetelegram concluded with the words: &quot;Formidable as they seem to be, theMartians have not moved from the pit into which they have fallen, and,indeed, seem incapable of doing so.  Probably this is due to therelative strength of the earth's gravitational energy.&quot;  On that lasttext their leader-writer expanded very comfortingly.Of course all the students in the crammer's biology class, to whichmy brother went that day, were intensely interested, but there were nosigns of any unusual excitement in the streets.  The afternoon paperspuffed scraps of news under big headlines.  They had nothing to tellbeyond the movements of troops about the common, and the burning ofthe pine woods between Woking and Weybridge, until eight.  Then the_St. James's Gazette_, in an extra-special edition, announced the barefact of the interruption of telegraphic communication.  This wasthought to be due to the falling of burning pine trees across theline.  Nothing more of the fighting was known that night, the night ofmy drive to Leatherhead and back.My brother felt no anxiety about us, as he knew from thedescription in the papers that the cylinder was a good two miles frommy house.  He made up his mind to run down that night to me, in order,as he says, to see the Things before they were killed.  He dispatcheda telegram, which never reached me, about four o'clock, and spent theevening at a music hall.In London, also, on Saturday night there was a thunderstorm, and mybrother reached Waterloo in a cab.  On the platform from which themidnight train usually starts he learned, after some waiting, that anaccident prevented trains from reaching Woking that night.  The natureof the accident he could not ascertain; indeed, the railwayauthorities did not clearly know at that time.  There was very littleexcitement in the station, as the officials, failing to realise thatanything further than a breakdown between Byfleet and Woking junctionhad occurred, were running the theatre trains which usually passedthrough Woking round by Virginia Water or Guildford.  They were busymaking the necessary arrangements to alter the route of theSouthampton and Portsmouth Sunday League excursions.  A nocturnalnewspaper reporter, mistaking my brother for the traffic manager, towhom he bears a slight resemblance, waylaid and tried to interviewhim.  Few people, excepting the railway officials, connected thebreakdown with the Martians.I have read, in another account of these events, that on Sundaymorning &quot;all London was electrified by the news from Woking.&quot;  As amatter of fact, there was nothing to justify that very extravagantphrase.  Plenty of Londoners did not hear of the Martians until thepanic of Monday morning.  Those who did took some time to realise allthat the hastily worded telegrams in the Sunday papers conveyed.  Themajority of people in London do not read Sunday papers.The habit of personal security, moreover, is so deeply fixed in theLondoner's mind, and startling intelligence so much a matter of coursein the papers, that they could read without any personal tremors:&quot;About seven o'clock last night the Martians came out of the cylinder,and, moving about under an armour of metallic shields, have completelywrecked Woking station with the adjacent houses, and massacred anentire battalion of the Cardigan Regiment.  No details are known.Maxims have been absolutely useless against their armour; the fieldguns have been disabled by them.  Flying hussars have been gallopinginto Chertsey.  The Martians appear to be moving slowly towardsChertsey or Windsor.  Great anxiety prevails in West Surrey, andearthworks are being thrown up to check the advance Londonward.&quot;  Thatwas how the Sunday _Sun_ put it, and a clever and remarkably prompt&quot;handbook&quot; article in the _Referee_ compared the affair to a menageriesuddenly let loose in a village.No one in London knew positively of the nature of the armouredMartians, and there was still a fixed idea that these monsters must besluggish: &quot;crawling,&quot; &quot;creeping painfully&quot;--such expressions occurredin almost all the earlier reports.  None of the telegrams could havebeen written by an eyewitness of their advance.  The Sunday papersprinted separate editions as further news came to hand, some even indefault of it.  But there was practically nothing more to tell peopleuntil late in the afternoon, when the authorities gave the pressagencies the news in their possession.  It was stated that the peopleof Walton and Weybridge, and all the district were pouring along theroads Londonward, and that was all.My brother went to church at the Foundling Hospital in the morning,still in ignorance of what had happened on the previous night.  Therehe heard allusions made to the invasion, and a special prayer forpeace.  Coming out, he bought a _Referee_.  He became alarmed at thenews in this, and went again to Waterloo station to find out ifcommunication were restored.  The omnibuses, carriages, cyclists, andinnumerable people walking in their best clothes seemed scarcelyaffected by the strange intelligence that the news venders weredisseminating.  People were interested, or, if alarmed, alarmed onlyon account of the local residents.  At the station he heard for thefirst time that the Windsor and Chertsey lines were now interrupted.The porters told him that several remarkable telegrams had beenreceived in the morning from Byfleet and Chertsey stations, but thatthese had abruptly ceased.  My brother could get very little precisedetail out of them.&quot;There's fighting going on about Weybridge&quot; was the extent of theirinformation.The train service was now very much disorganised.  Quite a numberof people who had been expecting friends from places on theSouth-Western network were standing about the station.  Onegrey-headed old gentleman came and abused the South-Western Companybitterly to my brother.  &quot;It wants showing up,&quot; he said.One or two trains came in from Richmond, Putney, and Kingston,containing people who had gone out for a day's boating and found thelocks closed and a feeling of panic in the air.  A man in a blue andwhite blazer addressed my brother, full of strange tidings.&quot;There's hosts of people driving into Kingston in traps and cartsand things, with boxes of valuables and all that,&quot; he said.  &quot;Theycome from Molesey and Weybridge and Walton, and they say there's beenguns heard at Chertsey, heavy firing, and that mounted soldiers havetold them to get off at once because the Martians are coming.  Weheard guns firing at Hampton Court station, but we thought it wasthunder.  What the dickens does it all mean?  The Martians can't getout of their pit, can they?&quot;My brother could not tell him.Afterwards he found that the vague feeling of alarm had spread tothe clients of the underground railway, and that the Sundayexcursionists began to return from all over the South-Western&quot;lung&quot;--Barnes, Wimbledon, Richmond Park, Kew, and so forth--atunnaturally early hours; but not a soul had anything more than vaguehearsay to tell of.  Everyone connected with the terminus seemedill-tempered.About five o'clock the gathering crowd in the station was immenselyexcited by the opening of the line of communication, which is almostinvariably closed, between the South-Eastern and the South-Westernstations, and the passage of carriage trucks bearing huge guns andcarriages crammed with soldiers.  These were the guns that werebrought up from Woolwich and Chatham to cover Kingston.  There wasan exchange of pleasantries: &quot;You'll get eaten!&quot;  &quot;We're thebeast-tamers!&quot; and so forth.  A little while after that a squad ofpolice came into the station and began to clear the public off theplatforms, and my brother went out into the street again.The church bells were ringing for evensong, and a squad ofSalvation Army lassies came singing down Waterloo Road.  On the bridgea number of loafers were watching a curious brown scum that camedrifting down the stream in patches.  The sun was just setting, and theClock Tower and the Houses of Parliament rose against one of the mostpeaceful skies it is possible to imagine, a sky of gold, barred withlong transverse stripes of reddish-purple cloud.  There was talk of afloating body.  One of the men there, a reservist he said he was, toldmy brother he had seen the heliograph flickering in the west.In Wellington Street my brother met a couple of sturdy roughs whohad just been rushed out of Fleet Street with still-wet newspapers andstaring placards.  &quot;Dreadful catastrophe!&quot; they bawled one to theother down Wellington Street.  &quot;Fighting at Weybridge!  Fulldescription!  Repulse of the Martians! London in Danger!&quot;  He had togive threepence for a copy of that paper.Then it was, and then only, that he realised something of the fullpower and terror of these monsters.  He learned that they were notmerely a handful of small sluggish creatures, but that they were mindsswaying vast mechanical bodies; and that they could move swiftly andsmite with such power that even the mightiest guns could not standagainst them.They were described as &quot;vast spiderlike machines, nearly a hundredfeet high, capable of the speed of an express train, and able to shootout a beam of intense heat.&quot;  Masked batteries, chiefly of field guns,had been planted in the country about Horsell Common, and especiallybetween the Woking district and London.  Five of the machines had beenseen moving towards the Thames, and one, by a happy chance, had beendestroyed.  In the other cases the shells had missed, and thebatteries had been at once annihilated by the Heat-Rays.  Heavylosses of soldiers were mentioned, but the tone of the dispatch wasoptimistic.The Martians had been repulsed; they were not invulnerable.  Theyhad retreated to their triangle of cylinders again, in the circleabout Woking.  Signallers with heliographs were pushing forward uponthem from all sides.  Guns were in rapid transit from Windsor,Portsmouth, Aldershot, Woolwich--even from the north; among others,long wire-guns of ninety-five tons from Woolwich.  Altogether onehundred and sixteen were in position or being hastily placed, chieflycovering London.  Never before in England had there been such a vastor rapid concentration of military material.Any further cylinders that fell, it was hoped, could be destroyedat once by high explosives, which were being rapidly manufactured anddistributed.  No doubt, ran the report, the situation was of thestrangest and gravest description, but the public was exhorted toavoid and discourage panic.  No doubt the Martians were strange andterrible in the extreme, but at the outside there could not be morethan twenty of them against our millions.The authorities had reason to suppose, from the size of thecylinders, that at the outside there could not be more than five ineach cylinder--fifteen altogether.  And one at least was disposedof--perhaps more.  The public would be fairly warned of the approachof danger, and elaborate measures were being taken for the protectionof the people in the threatened southwestern suburbs.  And so, withreiterated assurances of the safety of London and the ability of theauthorities to cope with the difficulty, this quasi-proclamationclosed.This was printed in enormous type on paper so fresh that it wasstill wet, and there had been no time to add a word of comment.  Itwas curious, my brother said, to see how ruthlessly the usual contentsof the paper had been hacked and taken out to give this place.All down Wellington Street people could be seen fluttering out thepink sheets and reading, and the Strand was suddenly noisy with thevoices of an army of hawkers following these pioneers.  Men camescrambling off buses to secure copies.  Certainly this news excitedpeople intensely, whatever their previous apathy.  The shutters of amap shop in the Strand were being taken down, my brother said, and aman in his Sunday raiment, lemon-yellow gloves even, was visibleinside the window hastily fastening maps of Surrey to the glass.Going on along the Strand to Trafalgar Square, the paper in hishand, my brother saw some of the fugitives from West Surrey.  Therewas a man with his wife and two boys and some articles of furniture ina cart such as greengrocers use.  He was driving from the direction ofWestminster Bridge; and close behind him came a hay waggon with fiveor six respectable-looking people in it, and some boxes and bundles.The faces of these people were haggard, and their entire appearancecontrasted conspicuously with the Sabbath-best appearance of thepeople on the omnibuses.  People in fashionable clothing peeped atthem out of cabs.  They stopped at the Square as if undecided whichway to take, and finally turned eastward along the Strand.  Some waybehind these came a man in workday clothes, riding one of thoseold-fashioned tricycles with a small front wheel.  He was dirty andwhite in the face.My brother turned down towards Victoria, and met a number of suchpeople.  He had a vague idea that he might see something of me.  Henoticed an unusual number of police regulating the traffic.  Some ofthe refugees were exchanging news with the people on the omnibuses.One was professing to have seen the Martians.  &quot;Boilers on stilts, Itell you, striding along like men.&quot;  Most of them were excited andanimated by their strange experience.Beyond Victoria the public-houses were doing a lively trade withthese arrivals.  At all the street corners groups of people werereading papers, talking excitedly, or staring at these unusual Sundayvisitors.  They seemed to increase as night drew on, until at last theroads, my brother said, were like Epsom High Street on a Derby Day.  Mybrother addressed several of these fugitives and got unsatisfactoryanswers from most.None of them could tell him any news of Woking except one man, whoassured him that Woking had been entirely destroyed on the previousnight.&quot;I come from Byfleet,&quot; he said; &quot;man on a bicycle came through theplace in the early morning, and ran from door to door warning us tocome away.  Then came soldiers.  We went out to look, and there wereclouds of smoke to the south--nothing but smoke, and not a soul comingthat way.  Then we heard the guns at Chertsey, and folks coming fromWeybridge.  So I've locked up my house and come on.&quot;At the time there was a strong feeling in the streets that theauthorities were to blame for their incapacity to dispose of theinvaders without all this inconvenience.About eight o'clock a noise of heavy firing was distinctly audibleall over the south of London.  My brother could not hear it for thetraffic in the main thoroughfares, but by striking through the quietback streets to the river he was able to distinguish it quite plainly.He walked from Westminster to his apartments near Regent's Park,about two.  He was now very anxious on my account, and disturbed atthe evident magnitude of the trouble.  His mind was inclined to run,even as mine had run on Saturday, on military details.  He thought ofall those silent, expectant guns, of the suddenly nomadic countryside;he tried to imagine &quot;boilers on stilts&quot; a hundred feet high.There were one or two cartloads of refugees passing along OxfordStreet, and several in the Marylebone Road, but so slowly was the newsspreading that Regent Street and Portland Place were full of theirusual Sunday-night promenaders, albeit they talked in groups, andalong the edge of Regent's Park there were as many silent couples&quot;walking out&quot; together under the scattered gas lamps as ever there hadbeen.  The night was warm and still, and a little oppressive; thesound of guns continued intermittently, and after midnight thereseemed to be sheet lightning in the south.He read and re-read the paper, fearing the worst had happened to me.He was restless, and after supper prowled out again aimlessly.  Hereturned and tried in vain to divert his attention to his examinationnotes.  He went to bed a little after midnight, and was awakened fromlurid dreams in the small hours of Monday by the sound of doorknockers, feet running in the street, distant drumming, and a clamourof bells.  Red reflections danced on the ceiling.  For a moment he layastonished, wondering whether day had come or the world gone mad.Then he jumped out of bed and ran to the window.His room was an attic and as he thrust his head out, up and downthe street there were a dozen echoes to the noise of his window sash,and heads in every kind of night disarray appeared.  Enquiries werebeing shouted.  &quot;They are coming!&quot; bawled a policeman, hammering atthe door; &quot;the Martians are coming!&quot; and hurried to the next door.The sound of drumming and trumpeting came from the Albany StreetBarracks, and every church within earshot was hard at work killingsleep with a vehement disorderly tocsin.  There was a noise of doorsopening, and window after window in the houses opposite flashed fromdarkness into yellow illumination.Up the street came galloping a closed carriage, bursting abruptlyinto noise at the corner, rising to a clattering climax under thewindow, and dying away slowly in the distance.  Close on the rear ofthis came a couple of cabs, the forerunners of a long procession offlying vehicles, going for the most part to Chalk Farm station, wherethe North-Western special trains were loading up, instead of comingdown the gradient into Euston.For a long time my brother stared out of the window in blankastonishment, watching the policemen hammering at door after door, anddelivering their incomprehensible message.  Then the door behind himopened, and the man who lodged across the landing came in, dressedonly in shirt, trousers, and slippers, his braces loose about hiswaist, his hair disordered from his pillow.&quot;What the devil is it?&quot; he asked.  &quot;A fire?  What a devil of arow!&quot;They both craned their heads out of the window, straining to hearwhat the policemen were shouting.  People were coming out of the sidestreets, and standing in groups at the corners talking.&quot;What the devil is it all about?&quot; said my brother's fellow lodger.My brother answered him vaguely and began to dress, running witheach garment to the window in order to miss nothing of the growingexcitement.  And presently men selling unnaturally early newspaperscame bawling into the street:&quot;London in danger of suffocation!  The Kingston and Richmonddefences forced!  Fearful massacres in the Thames Valley!&quot;And all about him--in the rooms below, in the houses on each sideand across the road, and behind in the Park Terraces and in thehundred other streets of that part of Marylebone, and the WestbournePark district and St. Pancras, and westward and northward in Kilburnand St. John's Wood and Hampstead, and eastward in Shoreditch andHighbury and Haggerston and Hoxton, and, indeed, through all thevastness of London from Ealing to East Ham--people were rubbing theireyes, and opening windows to stare out and ask aimless questions,dressing hastily as the first breath of the coming storm of Fear blewthrough the streets.  It was the dawn of the great panic.  London,which had gone to bed on Sunday night oblivious and inert, wasawakened, in the small hours of Monday morning, to a vivid sense ofdanger.Unable from his window to learn what was happening, my brother wentdown and out into the street, just as the sky between the parapets ofthe houses grew pink with the early dawn.  The flying people on footand in vehicles grew more numerous every moment.  &quot;Black Smoke!&quot; heheard people crying, and again &quot;Black Smoke!&quot;  The contagion of sucha unanimous fear was inevitable.  As my brother hesitated on thedoor-step, he saw another news vender approaching, and got a paperforthwith.  The man was running away with the rest, and selling hispapers for a shilling each as he ran--a grotesque mingling of profitand panic.And from this paper my brother read that catastrophic dispatch ofthe Commander-in-Chief:&quot;The Martians are able to discharge enormous clouds of a black andpoisonous vapour by means of rockets.  They have smothered ourbatteries, destroyed Richmond, Kingston, and Wimbledon, and areadvancing slowly towards London, destroying everything on the way.  Itis impossible to stop them.  There is no safety from the Black Smokebut in instant flight.&quot;That was all, but it was enough.  The whole population of the greatsix-million city was stirring, slipping, running; presently it wouldbe pouring _en masse_ northward.&quot;Black Smoke!&quot; the voices cried.  &quot;Fire!&quot;The bells of the neighbouring church made a jangling tumult, a cartcarelessly driven smashed, amid shrieks and curses, against the watertrough up the street.  Sickly yellow lights went to and fro in thehouses, and some of the passing cabs flaunted unextinguished lamps.And overhead the dawn was growing brighter, clear and steady and calm.He heard footsteps running to and fro in the rooms, and up and downstairs behind him.  His landlady came to the door, loosely wrapped indressing gown and shawl; her husband followed ejaculating.As my brother began to realise the import of all these things, heturned hastily to his own room, put all his available money--some tenpounds altogether--into his pockets, and went out again into thestreets.CHAPTER FIFTEENWHAT HAD HAPPENED IN SURREYIt was while the curate had sat and talked so wildly to me underthe hedge in the flat meadows near Halliford, and while my brother waswatching the fugitives stream over Westminster Bridge, that theMartians had resumed the offensive.  So far as one can ascertain fromthe conflicting accounts that have been put forth, the majority ofthem remained busied with preparations in the Horsell pit until ninethat night, hurrying on some operation that disengaged huge volumes ofgreen smoke.But three certainly came out about eight o'clock and, advancingslowly and cautiously, made their way through Byfleet and Pyrfordtowards Ripley and Weybridge, and so came in sight of the expectantbatteries against the setting sun.  These Martians did not advance ina body, but in a line, each perhaps a mile and a half from his nearestfellow.  They communicated with one another by means of sirenlikehowls, running up and down the scale from one note to another.It was this howling and firing of the guns at Ripley and St.George's Hill that we had heard at Upper Halliford.  The Ripleygunners, unseasoned artillery volunteers who ought never to have beenplaced in such a position, fired one wild, premature, ineffectualvolley, and bolted on horse and foot through the deserted village,while the Martian, without using his Heat-Ray, walked serenely overtheir guns, stepped gingerly among them, passed in front of them, andso came unexpectedly upon the guns in Painshill Park, which hedestroyed.The St. George's Hill men, however, were better led or of a bettermettle.  Hidden by a pine wood as they were, they seem to have beenquite unsuspected by the Martian nearest to them.  They laid theirguns as deliberately as if they had been on parade, and fired at abouta thousand yards' range.The shells flashed all round him, and he was seen to advance a fewpaces, stagger, and go down.  Everybody yelled together, and the gunswere reloaded in frantic haste.  The overthrown Martian set up aprolonged ululation, and immediately a second glittering giant,answering him, appeared over the trees to the south.  It would seemthat a leg of the tripod had been smashed by one of the shells.  Thewhole of the second volley flew wide of the Martian on the ground,and, simultaneously, both his companions brought their Heat-Rays tobear on the battery.  The ammunition blew up, the pine trees all aboutthe guns flashed into fire, and only one or two of the men who werealready running over the crest of the hill escaped.After this it would seem that the three took counsel together andhalted, and the scouts who were watching them report that theyremained absolutely stationary for the next half hour.  The Martianwho had been overthrown crawled tediously out of his hood, a smallbrown figure, oddly suggestive from that distance of a speck ofblight, and apparently engaged in the repair of his support.  Aboutnine he had finished, for his cowl was then seen above the treesagain.It was a few minutes past nine that night when these threesentinels were joined by four other Martians, each carrying a thickblack tube.  A similar tube was handed to each of the three, and theseven proceeded to distribute themselves at equal distances along acurved line between St. George's Hill, Weybridge, and the village ofSend, southwest of Ripley.A dozen rockets sprang out of the hills before them so soon as theybegan to move, and warned the waiting batteries about Ditton andEsher.  At the same time four of their fighting machines, similarlyarmed with tubes, crossed the river, and two of them, black againstthe western sky, came into sight of myself and the curate as wehurried wearily and painfully along the road that runs northward outof Halliford.  They moved, as it seemed to us, upon a cloud, for amilky mist covered the fields and rose to a third of their height.At this sight the curate cried faintly in his throat, and beganrunning; but I knew it was no good running from a Martian, and Iturned aside and crawled through dewy nettles and brambles into thebroad ditch by the side of the road.  He looked back, saw what I wasdoing, and turned to join me.The two halted, the nearer to us standing and facing Sunbury, theremoter being a grey indistinctness towards the evening star, awaytowards Staines.The occasional howling of the Martians had ceased; they took uptheir positions in the huge crescent about their cylinders in absolutesilence.  It was a crescent with twelve miles between its horns.  Neversince the devising of gunpowder was the beginning of a battle sostill.  To us and to an observer about Ripley it would have hadprecisely the same effect--the Martians seemed in solitary possessionof the darkling night, lit only as it was by the slender moon, thestars, the afterglow of the daylight, and the ruddy glare from St.George's Hill and the woods of Painshill.But facing that crescent everywhere--at Staines, Hounslow, Ditton,Esher, Ockham, behind hills and woods south of the river, and acrossthe flat grass meadows to the north of it, wherever a cluster of treesor village houses gave sufficient cover--the guns were waiting.  Thesignal rockets burst and rained their sparks through the night andvanished, and the spirit of all those watching batteries rose to atense expectation.  The Martians had but to advance into the line offire, and instantly those motionless black forms of men, those gunsglittering so darkly in the early night, would explode into athunderous fury of battle.No doubt the thought that was uppermost in a thousand of thosevigilant minds, even as it was uppermost in mine, was the riddle--howmuch they understood of us.  Did they grasp that we in our millionswere organized, disciplined, working together?  Or did they interpretour spurts of fire, the sudden stinging of our shells, our steadyinvestment of their encampment, as we should the furious unanimity ofonslaught in a disturbed hive of bees?  Did they dream they mightexterminate us?  (At that time no one knew what food they needed.)  Ahundred such questions struggled together in my mind as I watched thatvast sentinel shape.  And in the back of my mind was the sense of allthe huge unknown and hidden forces Londonward.  Had they preparedpitfalls? Were the powder mills at Hounslow ready as a snare?  Wouldthe Londoners have the heart and courage to make a greater Moscow oftheir mighty province of houses?Then, after an interminable time, as it seemed to us, crouching andpeering through the hedge, came a sound like the distant concussion ofa gun.  Another nearer, and then another.  And then the Martian besideus raised his tube on high and discharged it, gunwise, with a heavyreport that made the ground heave.  The one towards Staines answeredhim.  There was no flash, no smoke, simply that loaded detonation.I was so excited by these heavy minute-guns following one anotherthat I so far forgot my personal safety and my scalded hands as toclamber up into the hedge and stare towards Sunbury.  As I did so asecond report followed, and a big projectile hurtled overhead towardsHounslow.  I expected at least to see smoke or fire, or some suchevidence of its work.  But all I saw was the deep blue sky above, withone solitary star, and the white mist spreading wide and low beneath.And there had been no crash, no answering explosion.  The silence wasrestored; the minute lengthened to three.&quot;What has happened?&quot; said the curate, standing up beside me.&quot;Heaven knows!&quot; said I.A bat flickered by and vanished.  A distant tumult of shoutingbegan and ceased.  I looked again at the Martian, and saw he was nowmoving eastward along the riverbank, with a swift, rolling motion.Every moment I expected the fire of some hidden battery to springupon him; but the evening calm was unbroken.  The figure of the Martiangrew smaller as he receded, and presently the mist and the gatheringnight had swallowed him up.  By a common impulse we clambered higher.Towards Sunbury was a dark appearance, as though a conical hill hadsuddenly come into being there, hiding our view of the farthercountry; and then, remoter across the river, over Walton, we sawanother such summit.  These hill-like forms grew lower and broadereven as we stared.Moved by a sudden thought, I looked northward, and there Iperceived a third of these cloudy black kopjes had risen.Everything had suddenly become very still.  Far away to thesoutheast, marking the quiet, we heard the Martians hooting to oneanother, and then the air quivered again with the distant thud oftheir guns.  But the earthly artillery made no reply.Now at the time we could not understand these things, but later Iwas to learn the meaning of these ominous kopjes that gathered in thetwilight.  Each of the Martians, standing in the great crescent I havedescribed, had discharged, by means of the gunlike tube he carried, ahuge canister over whatever hill, copse, cluster of houses, or otherpossible cover for guns, chanced to be in front of him.  Some firedonly one of these, some two--as in the case of the one we had seen;the one at Ripley is said to have discharged no fewer than five atthat time.  These canisters smashed on striking the ground--they didnot explode--and incontinently disengaged an enormous volume of heavy,inky vapour, coiling and pouring upward in a huge and ebony cumuluscloud, a gaseous hill that sank and spread itself slowly over thesurrounding country.  And the touch of that vapour, the inhaling ofits pungent wisps, was death to all that breathes.It was heavy, this vapour, heavier than the densest smoke, so that,after the first tumultuous uprush and outflow of its impact, it sankdown through the air and poured over the ground in a manner ratherliquid than gaseous, abandoning the hills, and streaming into thevalleys and ditches and watercourses even as I have heard thecarbonic-acid gas that pours from volcanic clefts is wont to do.  Andwhere it came upon water some chemical action occurred, and thesurface would be instantly covered with a powdery scum that sankslowly and made way for more.  The scum was absolutely insoluble, andit is a strange thing, seeing the instant effect of the gas, that onecould drink without hurt the water from which it had been strained.The vapour did not diffuse as a true gas would do.  It hung togetherin banks, flowing sluggishly down the slope of the land and drivingreluctantly before the wind, and very slowly it combined with the mistand moisture of the air, and sank to the earth in the form of dust.Save that an unknown element giving a group of four lines in the blueof the spectrum is concerned, we are still entirely ignorant of thenature of this substance.Once the tumultuous upheaval of its dispersion was over, the blacksmoke clung so closely to the ground, even before its precipitation,that fifty feet up in the air, on the roofs and upper stories of highhouses and on great trees, there was a chance of escaping its poisonaltogether, as was proved even that night at Street Cobham and Ditton.The man who escaped at the former place tells a wonderful story ofthe strangeness of its coiling flow, and how he looked down from thechurch spire and saw the houses of the village rising like ghosts outof its inky nothingness.  For a day and a half he remained there,weary, starving and sun-scorched, the earth under the blue sky andagainst the prospect of the distant hills a velvet-black expanse, withred roofs, green trees, and, later, black-veiled shrubs and gates,barns, outhouses, and walls, rising here and there into the sunlight.But that was at Street Cobham, where the black vapour was allowedto remain until it sank of its own accord into the ground.  As a rulethe Martians, when it had served its purpose, cleared the air of itagain by wading into it and directing a jet of steam upon it.This they did with the vapour banks near us, as we saw in thestarlight from the window of a deserted house at Upper Halliford,whither we had returned.  From there we could see the searchlights onRichmond Hill and Kingston Hill going to and fro, and about eleven thewindows rattled, and we heard the sound of the huge siege guns thathad been put in position there.  These continued intermittently forthe space of a quarter of an hour, sending chance shots at theinvisible Martians at Hampton and Ditton, and then the pale beams ofthe electric light vanished, and were replaced by a bright red glow.Then the fourth cylinder fell--a brilliant green meteor--as Ilearned afterwards, in Bushey Park.  Before the guns on the Richmondand Kingston line of hills began, there was a fitful cannonade faraway in the southwest, due, I believe, to guns being fired haphazardbefore the black vapour could overwhelm the gunners.So, setting about it as methodically as men might smoke out awasps' nest, the Martians spread this strange stifling vapour over theLondonward country.  The horns of the crescent slowly moved apart,until at last they formed a line from Hanwell to Coombe and Malden.All night through their destructive tubes advanced.  Never once, afterthe Martian at St. George's Hill was brought down, did they give theartillery the ghost of a chance against them.  Wherever there was apossibility of guns being laid for them unseen, a fresh canister ofthe black vapour was discharged, and where the guns were openlydisplayed the Heat-Ray was brought to bear.By midnight the blazing trees along the slopes of Richmond Park andthe glare of Kingston Hill threw their light upon a network of blacksmoke, blotting out the whole valley of the Thames and extending asfar as the eye could reach.  And through this two Martians slowlywaded, and turned their hissing steam jets this way and that.They were sparing of the Heat-Ray that night, either because theyhad but a limited supply of material for its production or becausethey did not wish to destroy the country but only to crush and overawethe opposition they had aroused.  In the latter aim they certainlysucceeded.  Sunday night was the end of the organised opposition totheir movements.  After that no body of men would stand against them,so hopeless was the enterprise.  Even the crews of the torpedo-boatsand destroyers that had brought their quick-firers up the Thamesrefused to stop, mutinied, and went down again.  The only offensiveoperation men ventured upon after that night was the preparation ofmines and pitfalls, and even in that their energies were frantic andspasmodic.One has to imagine, as well as one may, the fate of those batteriestowards Esher, waiting so tensely in the twilight.  Survivors therewere none.  One may picture the orderly expectation, the officersalert and watchful, the gunners ready, the ammunition piled to hand,the limber gunners with their horses and waggons, the groups ofcivilian spectators standing as near as they were permitted, theevening stillness, the ambulances and hospital tents with the burnedand wounded from Weybridge; then the dull resonance of the shots theMartians fired, and the clumsy projectile whirling over the trees andhouses and smashing amid the neighbouring fields.One may picture, too, the sudden shifting of the attention, theswiftly spreading coils and bellyings of that blackness advancingheadlong, towering heavenward, turning the twilight to a palpabledarkness, a strange and horrible antagonist of vapour striding uponits victims, men and horses near it seen dimly, running, shrieking,falling headlong, shouts of dismay, the guns suddenly abandoned, menchoking and writhing on the ground, and the swift broadening-out ofthe opaque cone of smoke.  And then night and extinction--nothing buta silent mass of impenetrable vapour hiding its dead.Before dawn the black vapour was pouring through the streets ofRichmond, and the disintegrating organism of government was, with alast expiring effort, rousing the population of London to thenecessity of flight.CHAPTER SIXTEENTHE EXODUS FROM LONDONSo you understand the roaring wave of fear that swept through thegreatest city in the world just as Monday was dawning--the stream offlight rising swiftly to a torrent, lashing in a foaming tumult roundthe railway stations, banked up into a horrible struggle about theshipping in the Thames, and hurrying by every available channelnorthward and eastward.  By ten o'clock the police organisation, andby midday even the railway organisations, were losing coherency,losing shape and efficiency, guttering, softening, running at last inthat swift liquefaction of the social body.All the railway lines north of the Thames and the South-Easternpeople at Cannon Street had been warned by midnight on Sunday, andtrains were being filled.  People were fighting savagely forstanding-room in the carriages even at two o'clock.  By three, peoplewere being trampled and crushed even in Bishopsgate Street, a coupleof hundred yards or more from Liverpool Street station; revolvers werefired, people stabbed, and the policemen who had been sent to directthe traffic, exhausted and infuriated, were breaking the heads of thepeople they were called out to protect.And as the day advanced and the engine drivers and stokers refusedto return to London, the pressure of the flight drove the people in anever-thickening multitude away from the stations and along thenorthward-running roads.  By midday a Martian had been seen at Barnes,and a cloud of slowly sinking black vapour drove along the Thames andacross the flats of Lambeth, cutting off all escape over the bridgesin its sluggish advance.  Another bank drove over Ealing, andsurrounded a little island of survivors on Castle Hill, alive, butunable to escape.After a fruitless struggle to get aboard a North-Western train atChalk Farm--the engines of the trains that had loaded in the goodsyard there _ploughed_ through shrieking people, and a dozen stalwart menfought to keep the crowd from crushing the driver against hisfurnace--my brother emerged upon the Chalk Farm road, dodged acrossthrough a hurrying swarm of vehicles, and had the luck to be foremostin the sack of a cycle shop.  The front tire of the machine he got waspunctured in dragging it through the window, but he got up and off,notwithstanding, with no further injury than a cut wrist.  The steepfoot of Haverstock Hill was impassable owing to several overturnedhorses, and my brother struck into Belsize Road.So he got out of the fury of the panic, and, skirting the EdgwareRoad, reached Edgware about seven, fasting and wearied, but well aheadof the crowd.  Along the road people were standing in the roadway,curious, wondering.  He was passed by a number of cyclists, somehorsemen, and two motor cars.  A mile from Edgware the rim of thewheel broke, and the machine became unridable.  He left it by theroadside and trudged through the village.  There were shops halfopened in the main street of the place, and people crowded on thepavement and in the doorways and windows, staring astonished at thisextraordinary procession of fugitives that was beginning.  Hesucceeded in getting some food at an inn.For a time he remained in Edgware not knowing what next to do.  Theflying people increased in number.  Many of them, like my brother,seemed inclined to loiter in the place.  There was no fresh news ofthe invaders from Mars.At that time the road was crowded, but as yet far from congested.Most of the fugitives at that hour were mounted on cycles, but therewere soon motor cars, hansom cabs, and carriages hurrying along, andthe dust hung in heavy clouds along the road to St. Albans.It was perhaps a vague idea of making his way to Chelmsford, wheresome friends of his lived, that at last induced my brother to strikeinto a quiet lane running eastward.  Presently he came upon a stile,and, crossing it, followed a footpath northeastward.  He passed nearseveral farmhouses and some little places whose names he did notlearn.  He saw few fugitives until, in a grass lane towards HighBarnet, he happened upon two ladies who became his fellow travellers.He came upon them just in time to save them.He heard their screams, and, hurrying round the corner, saw acouple of men struggling to drag them out of the little pony-chaise inwhich they had been driving, while a third with difficulty held thefrightened pony's head.  One of the ladies, a short woman dressed inwhite, was simply screaming; the other, a dark, slender figure,slashed at the man who gripped her arm with a whip she held in herdisengaged hand.My brother immediately grasped the situation, shouted, and hurriedtowards the struggle.  One of the men desisted and turned towards him,and my brother, realising from his antagonist's face that a fight wasunavoidable, and being an expert boxer, went into him forthwith andsent him down against the wheel of the chaise.It was no time for pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid himquiet with a kick, and gripped the collar of the man who pulled at theslender lady's arm.  He heard the clatter of hoofs, the whip stungacross his face, a third antagonist struck him between the eyes, andthe man he held wrenched himself free and made off down the lane inthe direction from which he had come.Partly stunned, he found himself facing the man who had held thehorse's head, and became aware of the chaise receding from him downthe lane, swaying from side to side, and with the women in it lookingback.  The man before him, a burly rough, tried to close, and hestopped him with a blow in the face.  Then, realising that he wasdeserted, he dodged round and made off down the lane after the chaise,with the sturdy man close behind him, and the fugitive, who had turnednow, following remotely.Suddenly he stumbled and fell; his immediate pursuer went headlong,and he rose to his feet to find himself with a couple of antagonistsagain.  He would have had little chance against them had not theslender lady very pluckily pulled up and returned to his help.  Itseems she had had a revolver all this time, but it had been under theseat when she and her companion were attacked.  She fired at sixyards' distance, narrowly missing my brother.  The less courageous ofthe robbers made off, and his companion followed him, cursing hiscowardice.  They both stopped in sight down the lane, where the thirdman lay insensible.&quot;Take this!&quot; said the slender lady, and she gave my brother herrevolver.&quot;Go back to the chaise,&quot; said my brother, wiping the blood from hissplit lip.She turned without a word--they were both panting--and they wentback to where the lady in white struggled to hold back the frightenedpony.The robbers had evidently had enough of it.  When my brother lookedagain they were retreating.&quot;I'll sit here,&quot; said my brother, &quot;if I may&quot;; and he got upon theempty front seat.  The lady looked over her shoulder.&quot;Give me the reins,&quot; she said, and laid the whip along the pony'sside.  In another moment a bend in the road hid the three men from mybrother's eyes.So, quite unexpectedly, my brother found himself, panting, with acut mouth, a bruised jaw, and bloodstained knuckles, driving along anunknown lane with these two women.He learned they were the wife and the younger sister of a surgeonliving at Stanmore, who had come in the small hours from a dangerouscase at Pinner, and heard at some railway station on his way of theMartian advance.  He had hurried home, roused the women--their servanthad left them two days before--packed some provisions, put hisrevolver under the seat--luckily for my brother--and told them todrive on to Edgware, with the idea of getting a train there.  Hestopped behind to tell the neighbours.  He would overtake them, hesaid, at about half past four in the morning, and now it was nearlynine and they had seen nothing of him.  They could not stop in Edgwarebecause of the growing traffic through the place, and so they had comeinto this side lane.That was the story they told my brother in fragments when presentlythey stopped again, nearer to New Barnet.  He promised to stay withthem, at least until they could determine what to do, or until themissing man arrived, and professed to be an expert shot with therevolver--a weapon strange to him--in order to give them confidence.They made a sort of encampment by the wayside, and the pony becamehappy in the hedge.  He told them of his own escape out of London, andall that he knew of these Martians and their ways.  The sun crepthigher in the sky, and after a time their talk died out and gave placeto an uneasy state of anticipation.  Several wayfarers came along thelane, and of these my brother gathered such news as he could.  Everybroken answer he had deepened his impression of the great disasterthat had come on humanity, deepened his persuasion of the immediatenecessity for prosecuting this flight.  He urged the matter upon them.&quot;We have money,&quot; said the slender woman, and hesitated.Her eyes met my brother's, and her hesitation ended.&quot;So have I,&quot; said my brother.She explained that they had as much as thirty pounds in gold,besides a five-pound note, and suggested that with that they might getupon a train at St. Albans or New Barnet.  My brother thought that washopeless, seeing the fury of the Londoners to crowd upon the trains,and broached his own idea of striking across Essex towards Harwich andthence escaping from the country altogether.Mrs. Elphinstone--that was the name of the woman in white--wouldlisten to no reasoning, and kept calling upon &quot;George&quot;; but hersister-in-law was astonishingly quiet and deliberate, and at lastagreed to my brother's suggestion.  So, designing to cross the GreatNorth Road, they went on towards Barnet, my brother leading the ponyto save it as much as possible.  As the sun crept up the sky the daybecame excessively hot, and under foot a thick, whitish sand grewburning and blinding, so that they travelled only very slowly.  Thehedges were grey with dust.  And as they advanced towards Barnet atumultuous murmuring grew stronger.They began to meet more people.  For the most part these werestaring before them, murmuring indistinct questions, jaded, haggard,unclean.  One man in evening dress passed them on foot, his eyes onthe ground.  They heard his voice, and, looking back at him, saw onehand clutched in his hair and the other beating invisible things.  Hisparoxysm of rage over, he went on his way without once looking back.As my brother's party went on towards the crossroads to the southof Barnet they saw a woman approaching the road across some fields ontheir left, carrying a child and with two other children; and thenpassed a man in dirty black, with a thick stick in one hand and asmall portmanteau in the other.  Then round the corner of the lane,from between the villas that guarded it at its confluence with thehigh road, came a little cart drawn by a sweating black pony anddriven by a sallow youth in a bowler hat, grey with dust.  There werethree girls, East End factory girls, and a couple of little childrencrowded in the cart.&quot;This'll tike us rahnd Edgware?&quot; asked the driver, wild-eyed,white-faced; and when my brother told him it would if he turned to theleft, he whipped up at once without the formality of thanks.My brother noticed a pale grey smoke or haze rising among thehouses in front of them, and veiling the white facade of a terracebeyond the road that appeared between the backs of the villas.  Mrs.Elphinstone suddenly cried out at a number of tongues of smoky redflame leaping up above the houses in front of them against the hot,blue sky.  The tumultuous noise resolved itself now into thedisorderly mingling of many voices, the gride of many wheels, thecreaking of waggons, and the staccato of hoofs.  The lane came roundsharply not fifty yards from the crossroads.&quot;Good heavens!&quot; cried Mrs. Elphinstone.  &quot;What is this you aredriving us into?&quot;My brother stopped.For the main road was a boiling stream of people, a torrent ofhuman beings rushing northward, one pressing on another.  A great bankof dust, white and luminous in the blaze of the sun, made everythingwithin twenty feet of the ground grey and indistinct and wasperpetually renewed by the hurrying feet of a dense crowd of horsesand of men and women on foot, and by the wheels of vehicles of everydescription.&quot;Way!&quot; my brother heard voices crying.  &quot;Make way!&quot;It was like riding into the smoke of a fire to approach the meetingpoint of the lane and road; the crowd roared like a fire, and the dustwas hot and pungent.  And, indeed, a little way up the road a villawas burning and sending rolling masses of black smoke across the roadto add to the confusion.Two men came past them.  Then a dirty woman, carrying a heavybundle and weeping.  A lost retriever dog, with hanging tongue,circled dubiously round them, scared and wretched, and fled at mybrother's threat.So much as they could see of the road Londonward between the housesto the right was a tumultuous stream of dirty, hurrying people, pentin between the villas on either side; the black heads, the crowdedforms, grew into distinctness as they rushed towards the corner,hurried past, and merged their individuality again in a recedingmultitude that was swallowed up at last in a cloud of dust.&quot;Go on!  Go on!&quot; cried the voices.  &quot;Way!  Way!&quot;One man's hands pressed on the back of another.  My brother stoodat the pony's head.  Irresistibly attracted, he advanced slowly, paceby pace, down the lane.Edgware had been a scene of confusion, Chalk Farm a riotous tumult,but this was a whole population in movement.  It is hard to imaginethat host.  It had no character of its own.  The figures poured outpast the corner, and receded with their backs to the group in thelane.  Along the margin came those who were on foot threatened by thewheels, stumbling in the ditches, blundering into one another.The carts and carriages crowded close upon one another, makinglittle way for those swifter and more impatient vehicles that dartedforward every now and then when an opportunity showed itself of doingso, sending the people scattering against the fences and gates of thevillas.&quot;Push on!&quot; was the cry.  &quot;Push on!  They are coming!&quot;In one cart stood a blind man in the uniform of the Salvation Army,gesticulating with his crooked fingers and bawling, &quot;Eternity!Eternity!&quot;  His voice was hoarse and very loud so that my brothercould hear him long after he was lost to sight in the dust.  Some ofthe people who crowded in the carts whipped stupidly at their horsesand quarrelled with other drivers; some sat motionless, staring atnothing with miserable eyes; some gnawed their hands with thirst, orlay prostrate in the bottoms of their conveyances.  The horses' bitswere covered with foam, their eyes bloodshot.There were cabs, carriages, shop cars, waggons, beyond counting; amail cart, a road-cleaner's cart marked &quot;Vestry of St. Pancras,&quot; ahuge timber waggon crowded with roughs.  A brewer's dray rumbled bywith its two near wheels splashed with fresh blood.&quot;Clear the way!&quot; cried the voices.  &quot;Clear the way!&quot;&quot;Eter-nity!  Eter-nity!&quot; came echoing down the road.There were sad, haggard women tramping by, well dressed, withchildren that cried and stumbled, their dainty clothes smothered indust, their weary faces smeared with tears.  With many of these camemen, sometimes helpful, sometimes lowering and savage.  Fighting sideby side with them pushed some weary street outcast in faded blackrags, wide-eyed, loud-voiced, and foul-mouthed.  There were sturdyworkmen thrusting their way along, wretched, unkempt men, clothed likeclerks or shopmen, struggling spasmodically; a wounded soldier mybrother noticed, men dressed in the clothes of railway porters, onewretched creature in a nightshirt with a coat thrown over it.But varied as its composition was, certain things all that host hadin common.  There were fear and pain on their faces, and fear behindthem.  A tumult up the road, a quarrel for a place in a waggon, sentthe whole host of them quickening their pace; even a man so scared andbroken that his knees bent under him was galvanised for a moment intorenewed activity.  The heat and dust had already been at work uponthis multitude.  Their skins were dry, their lips black and cracked.They were all thirsty, weary, and footsore.  And amid the variouscries one heard disputes, reproaches, groans of weariness and fatigue;the voices of most of them were hoarse and weak.  Through it all ran arefrain:&quot;Way!  Way!  The Martians are coming!&quot;Few stopped and came aside from that flood.  The lane openedslantingly into the main road with a narrow opening, and had adelusive appearance of coming from the direction of London.  Yet akind of eddy of people drove into its mouth; weaklings elbowed out ofthe stream, who for the most part rested but a moment before plunginginto it again.  A little way down the lane, with two friends bendingover him, lay a man with a bare leg, wrapped about with bloody rags.He was a lucky man to have friends.A little old man, with a grey military moustache and a filthy blackfrock coat, limped out and sat down beside the trap, removed hisboot--his sock was blood-stained--shook out a pebble, and hobbled onagain; and then a little girl of eight or nine, all alone, threwherself under the hedge close by my brother, weeping.&quot;I can't go on!  I can't go on!&quot;My brother woke from his torpor of astonishment and lifted her up,speaking gently to her, and carried her to Miss Elphinstone.  So soonas my brother touched her she became quite still, as if frightened.&quot;Ellen!&quot; shrieked a woman in the crowd, with tears in hervoice--&quot;Ellen!&quot;  And the child suddenly darted away from my brother,crying &quot;Mother!&quot;&quot;They are coming,&quot; said a man on horseback, riding past along thelane.&quot;Out of the way, there!&quot; bawled a coachman, towering high; and mybrother saw a closed carriage turning into the lane.The people crushed back on one another to avoid the horse.  Mybrother pushed the pony and chaise back into the hedge, and the mandrove by and stopped at the turn of the way.  It was a carriage, witha pole for a pair of horses, but only one was in the traces.  Mybrother saw dimly through the dust that two men lifted out somethingon a white stretcher and put it gently on the grass beneath the privethedge.One of the men came running to my brother.&quot;Where is there any water?&quot; he said.  &quot;He is dying fast, and verythirsty.  It is Lord Garrick.&quot;&quot;Lord Garrick!&quot; said my brother; &quot;the Chief Justice?&quot;&quot;The water?&quot; he said.&quot;There may be a tap,&quot; said my brother, &quot;in some of the houses.  Wehave no water.  I dare not leave my people.&quot;The man pushed against the crowd towards the gate of the cornerhouse.&quot;Go on!&quot; said the people, thrusting at him.  &quot;They are coming!  Goon!&quot;Then my brother's attention was distracted by a bearded, eagle-facedman lugging a small handbag, which split even as my brother'seyes rested on it and disgorged a mass of sovereigns that seemed tobreak up into separate coins as it struck the ground.  They rolledhither and thither among the struggling feet of men and horses.  Theman stopped and looked stupidly at the heap, and the shaft of a cabstruck his shoulder and sent him reeling.  He gave a shriek and dodgedback, and a cartwheel shaved him narrowly.&quot;Way!&quot; cried the men all about him.  &quot;Make way!&quot;So soon as the cab had passed, he flung himself, with both handsopen, upon the heap of coins, and began thrusting handfuls in hispocket.  A horse rose close upon him, and in another moment, halfrising, he had been borne down under the horse's hoofs.&quot;Stop!&quot; screamed my brother, and pushing a woman out of his way,tried to clutch the bit of the horse.Before he could get to it, he heard a scream under the wheels, andsaw through the dust the rim passing over the poor wretch's back.  Thedriver of the cart slashed his whip at my brother, who ran roundbehind the cart.  The multitudinous shouting confused his ears.  Theman was writhing in the dust among his scattered money, unable torise, for the wheel had broken his back, and his lower limbs lay limpand dead.  My brother stood up and yelled at the next driver, and aman on a black horse came to his assistance.&quot;Get him out of the road,&quot; said he; and, clutching the man's collarwith his free hand, my brother lugged him sideways.  But he stillclutched after his money, and regarded my brother fiercely, hammeringat his arm with a handful of gold.  &quot;Go on!  Go on!&quot; shouted angryvoices behind.&quot;Way!  Way!&quot;There was a smash as the pole of a carriage crashed into the cartthat the man on horseback stopped.  My brother looked up, and the manwith the gold twisted his head round and bit the wrist that held hiscollar.  There was a concussion, and the black horse came staggeringsideways, and the carthorse pushed beside it.  A hoof missed mybrother's foot by a hair's breadth.  He released his grip on thefallen man and jumped back.  He saw anger change to terror on the faceof the poor wretch on the ground, and in a moment he was hidden and mybrother was borne backward and carried past the entrance of the lane,and had to fight hard in the torrent to recover it.He saw Miss Elphinstone covering her eyes, and a little child, withall a child's want of sympathetic imagination, staring with dilatedeyes at a dusty something that lay black and still, ground and crushedunder the rolling wheels.  &quot;Let us go back!&quot; he shouted, and beganturning the pony round. &quot;We cannot cross this--hell,&quot; he said and theywent back a hundred yards the way they had come, until the fightingcrowd was hidden.  As they passed the bend in the lane my brother sawthe face of the dying man in the ditch under the privet, deadly whiteand drawn, and shining with perspiration.  The two women sat silent,crouching in their seat and shivering.Then beyond the bend my brother stopped again.  Miss Elphinstonewas white and pale, and her sister-in-law sat weeping, too wretchedeven to call upon &quot;George.&quot;  My brother was horrified and perplexed.So soon as they had retreated he realised how urgent and unavoidableit was to attempt this crossing.  He turned to Miss Elphinstone,suddenly resolute.&quot;We must go that way,&quot; he said, and led the pony round again.For the second time that day this girl proved her quality.  To forcetheir way into the torrent of people, my brother plunged into thetraffic and held back a cab horse, while she drove the pony across itshead.  A waggon locked wheels for a moment and ripped a long splinterfrom the chaise.  In another moment they were caught and swept forwardby the stream.  My brother, with the cabman's whip marks red acrosshis face and hands, scrambled into the chaise and took the reins fromher.&quot;Point the revolver at the man behind,&quot; he said, giving it to her,&quot;if he presses us too hard.  No!--point it at his horse.&quot;Then he began to look out for a chance of edging to the rightacross the road.  But once in the stream he seemed to lose volition,to become a part of that dusty rout.  They swept through ChippingBarnet with the torrent; they were nearly a mile beyond the centre ofthe town before they had fought across to the opposite side of theway.  It was din and confusion indescribable; but in and beyond thetown the road forks repeatedly, and this to some extent relieved thestress.They struck eastward through Hadley, and there on either side ofthe road, and at another place farther on they came upon a greatmultitude of people drinking at the stream, some fighting to come atthe water.  And farther on, from a lull near East Barnet, they sawtwo trains running slowly one after the other without signal ororder--trains swarming with people, with men even among the coalsbehind the engines--going northward along the Great Northern Railway.My brother supposes they must have filled outside London, for at thattime the furious terror of the people had rendered the centraltermini impossible.Near this place they halted for the rest of the afternoon, for theviolence of the day had already utterly exhausted all three of them.They began to suffer the beginnings of hunger; the night was cold, andnone of them dared to sleep.  And in the evening many people camehurrying along the road nearby their stopping place, fleeing fromunknown dangers before them, and going in the direction from which mybrother had come.CHAPTER SEVENTEENTHE &quot;THUNDER CHILD&quot;Had the Martians aimed only at destruction, they might on Mondayhave annihilated the entire population of London, as it spread itselfslowly through the home counties.  Not only along the road throughBarnet, but also through Edgware and Waltham Abbey, and along theroads eastward to Southend and Shoeburyness, and south of the Thamesto Deal and Broadstairs, poured the same frantic rout.  If one couldhave hung that June morning in a balloon in the blazing blue aboveLondon every northward and eastward road running out of the tangledmaze of streets would have seemed stippled black with the streamingfugitives, each dot a human agony of terror and physical distress.  Ihave set forth at length in the last chapter my brother's account ofthe road through Chipping Barnet, in order that my readers may realisehow that swarming of black dots appeared to one of those concerned.Never before in the history of the world had such a mass of humanbeings moved and suffered together.  The legendary hosts of Goths andHuns, the hugest armies Asia has ever seen, would have been but a dropin that current.  And this was no disciplined march; it was astampede--a stampede gigantic and terrible--without order and withouta goal, six million people unarmed and unprovisioned, drivingheadlong.  It was the beginning of the rout of civilisation, of themassacre of mankind.Directly below him the balloonist would have seen the network ofstreets far and wide, houses, churches, squares, crescents,gardens--already derelict--spread out like a huge map, and in thesouthward _blotted_.  Over Ealing, Richmond, Wimbledon, it wouldhave seemed as if some monstrous pen had flung ink upon the chart.Steadily, incessantly, each black splash grew and spread, shooting outramifications this way and that, now banking itself against risingground, now pouring swiftly over a crest into a new-found valley,exactly as a gout of ink would spread itself upon blotting paper.And beyond, over the blue hills that rise southward of the river,the glittering Martians went to and fro, calmly and methodicallyspreading their poison cloud over this patch of country and then overthat, laying it again with their steam jets when it had served itspurpose, and taking possession of the conquered country.  They do notseem to have aimed at extermination so much as at completedemoralisation and the destruction of any opposition.  They explodedany stores of powder they came upon, cut every telegraph, and wreckedthe railways here and there.  They were hamstringing mankind.  Theyseemed in no hurry to extend the field of their operations, and didnot come beyond the central part of London all that day.  It ispossible that a very considerable number of people in London stuck totheir houses through Monday morning.  Certain it is that many died athome suffocated by the Black Smoke.Until about midday the Pool of London was an astonishing scene.Steamboats and shipping of all sorts lay there, tempted by theenormous sums of money offered by fugitives, and it is said that manywho swam out to these vessels were thrust off with boathooks anddrowned.  About one o'clock in the afternoon the thinning remnant of acloud of the black vapour appeared between the arches of BlackfriarsBridge.  At that the Pool became a scene of mad confusion, fighting,and collision, and for some time a multitude of boats and bargesjammed in the northern arch of the Tower Bridge, and the sailors andlightermen had to fight savagely against the people who swarmed uponthem from the riverfront.  People were actually clambering down thepiers of the bridge from above.When, an hour later, a Martian appeared beyond the Clock Tower andwaded down the river, nothing but wreckage floated above Limehouse.Of the falling of the fifth cylinder I have presently to tell.  Thesixth star fell at Wimbledon.  My brother, keeping watch beside thewomen in the chaise in a meadow, saw the green flash of it far beyondthe hills.  On Tuesday the little party, still set upon getting acrossthe sea, made its way through the swarming country towards Colchester.The news that the Martians were now in possession of the whole ofLondon was confirmed.  They had been seen at Highgate, and even, itwas said, at Neasden.  But they did not come into my brother's viewuntil the morrow.That day the scattered multitudes began to realise the urgent needof provisions.  As they grew hungry the rights of property ceased tobe regarded.  Farmers were out to defend their cattle-sheds,granaries, and ripening root crops with arms in their hands.  A numberof people now, like my brother, had their faces eastward, and therewere some desperate souls even going back towards London to get food.These were chiefly people from the northern suburbs, whose knowledgeof the Black Smoke came by hearsay.  He heard that about half themembers of the government had gathered at Birmingham, and thatenormous quantities of high explosives were being prepared to be usedin automatic mines across the Midland counties.He was also told that the Midland Railway Company had replaced thedesertions of the first day's panic, had resumed traffic, and wasrunning northward trains from St. Albans to relieve the congestion ofthe home counties.  There was also a placard in Chipping Ongarannouncing that large stores of flour were available in the northerntowns and that within twenty-four hours bread would be distributedamong the starving people in the neighbourhood.  But this intelligencedid not deter him from the plan of escape he had formed, and the threepressed eastward all day, and heard no more of the bread distributionthan this promise.  Nor, as a matter of fact, did anyone else hearmore of it.  That night fell the seventh star, falling upon PrimroseHill.  It fell while Miss Elphinstone was watching, for she took thatduty alternately with my brother.  She saw it.On Wednesday the three fugitives--they had passed the night in afield of unripe wheat--reached Chelmsford, and there a body of theinhabitants, calling itself the Committee of Public Supply, seized thepony as provisions, and would give nothing in exchange for it but thepromise of a share in it the next day.  Here there were rumours ofMartians at Epping, and news of the destruction of Waltham AbbeyPowder Mills in a vain attempt to blow up one of the invaders.People were watching for Martians here from the church towers.  Mybrother, very luckily for him as it chanced, preferred to push on atonce to the coast rather than wait for food, although all three ofthem were very hungry.  By midday they passed through Tillingham,which, strangely enough, seemed to be quite silent and deserted, savefor a few furtive plunderers hunting for food.  Near Tillingham theysuddenly came in sight of the sea, and the most amazing crowd ofshipping of all sorts that it is possible to imagine.For after the sailors could no longer come up the Thames, they cameon to the Essex coast, to Harwich and Walton and Clacton, andafterwards to Foulness and Shoebury, to bring off the people.  Theylay in a huge sickle-shaped curve that vanished into mist at lasttowards the Naze.  Close inshore was a multitude of fishingsmacks--English, Scotch, French, Dutch, and Swedish; steam launchesfrom the Thames, yachts, electric boats; and beyond were ships of largeburden, a multitude of filthy colliers, trim merchantmen, cattle ships,passenger boats, petroleum tanks, ocean tramps, an old white transporteven, neat white and grey liners from Southampton and Hamburg; andalong the blue coast across the Blackwater my brother could make outdimly a dense swarm of boats chaffering with the people on the beach,a swarm which also extended up the Blackwater almost to Maldon.About a couple of miles out lay an ironclad, very low in the water,almost, to my brother's perception, like a water-logged ship.  Thiswas the ram _Thunder Child_.  It was the only warship in sight, but faraway to the right over the smooth surface of the sea--for that daythere was a dead calm--lay a serpent of black smoke to mark the nextironclads of the Channel Fleet, which hovered in an extended line,steam up and ready for action, across the Thames estuary during thecourse of the Martian conquest, vigilant and yet powerless to preventit.At the sight of the sea, Mrs. Elphinstone, in spite of theassurances of her sister-in-law, gave way to panic.  She had neverbeen out of England before, she would rather die than trust herselffriendless in a foreign country, and so forth.  She seemed, poor woman,to imagine that the French and the Martians might prove very similar.She had been growing increasingly hysterical, fearful, and depressedduring the two days' journeyings.  Her great idea was to return toStanmore.  Things had been always well and safe at Stanmore.  Theywould find George at Stanmore.It was with the greatest difficulty they could get her down to thebeach, where presently my brother succeeded in attracting theattention of some men on a paddle steamer from the Thames.  They senta boat and drove a bargain for thirty-six pounds for the three.  Thesteamer was going, these men said, to Ostend.It was about two o'clock when my brother, having paid their faresat the gangway, found himself safely aboard the steamboat with hischarges.  There was food aboard, albeit at exorbitant prices, and thethree of them contrived to eat a meal on one of the seats forward.There were already a couple of score of passengers aboard, some ofwhom had expended their last money in securing a passage, but thecaptain lay off the Blackwater until five in the afternoon, picking uppassengers until the seated decks were even dangerously crowded.  Hewould probably have remained longer had it not been for the sound ofguns that began about that hour in the south.  As if in answer, theironclad seaward fired a small gun and hoisted a string of flags.  Ajet of smoke sprang out of her funnels.Some of the passengers were of opinion that this firing came fromShoeburyness, until it was noticed that it was growing louder.  At thesame time, far away in the southeast the masts and upperworks of threeironclads rose one after the other out of the sea, beneath clouds ofblack smoke.  But my brother's attention speedily reverted to thedistant firing in the south.  He fancied he saw a column of smokerising out of the distant grey haze.The little steamer was already flapping her way eastward of the bigcrescent of shipping, and the low Essex coast was growing blue andhazy, when a Martian appeared, small and faint in the remote distance,advancing along the muddy coast from the direction of Foulness.  Atthat the captain on the bridge swore at the top of his voice with fearand anger at his own delay, and the paddles seemed infected with histerror.  Every soul aboard stood at the bulwarks or on the seats ofthe steamer and stared at that distant shape, higher than the trees orchurch towers inland, and advancing with a leisurely parody of a humanstride.It was the first Martian my brother had seen, and he stood, moreamazed than terrified, watching this Titan advancing deliberatelytowards the shipping, wading farther and farther into the water as thecoast fell away.  Then, far away beyond the Crouch, came another,striding over some stunted trees, and then yet another, still fartheroff, wading deeply through a shiny mudflat that seemed to hang halfwayup between sea and sky.  They were all stalking seaward, as if tointercept the escape of the multitudinous vessels that were crowdedbetween Foulness and the Naze.  In spite of the throbbing exertions ofthe engines of the little paddle-boat, and the pouring foam that herwheels flung behind her, she receded with terrifying slowness fromthis ominous advance.Glancing northwestward, my brother saw the large crescent ofshipping already writhing with the approaching terror; one shippassing behind another, another coming round from broadside to end on,steamships whistling and giving off volumes of steam, sails being letout, launches rushing hither and thither.  He was so fascinated bythis and by the creeping danger away to the left that he had no eyesfor anything seaward.  And then a swift movement of the steamboat (shehad suddenly come round to avoid being run down) flung him headlongfrom the seat upon which he was standing.  There was a shouting allabout him, a trampling of feet, and a cheer that seemed to be answeredfaintly.  The steamboat lurched and rolled him over upon his hands.He sprang to his feet and saw to starboard, and not a hundred yardsfrom their heeling, pitching boat, a vast iron bulk like the blade ofa plough tearing through the water, tossing it on either side in hugewaves of foam that leaped towards the steamer, flinging her paddleshelplessly in the air, and then sucking her deck down almost to thewaterline.A douche of spray blinded my brother for a moment.  When his eyeswere clear again he saw the monster had passed and was rushinglandward.  Big iron upperworks rose out of this headlong structure,and from that twin funnels projected and spat a smoking blast shotwith fire.  It was the torpedo ram, _Thunder Child_, steaming headlong,coming to the rescue of the threatened shipping.Keeping his footing on the heaving deck by clutching the bulwarks,my brother looked past this charging leviathan at the Martians again,and he saw the three of them now close together, and standing so farout to sea that their tripod supports were almost entirely submerged.Thus sunken, and seen in remote perspective, they appeared far lessformidable than the huge iron bulk in whose wake the steamer waspitching so helplessly.  It would seem they were regarding this newantagonist with astonishment.  To their intelligence, it may be, thegiant was even such another as themselves.  The _Thunder Child_ fired nogun, but simply drove full speed towards them.  It was probably hernot firing that enabled her to get so near the enemy as she did.  Theydid not know what to make of her.  One shell, and they would have senther to the bottom forthwith with the Heat-Ray.She was steaming at such a pace that in a minute she seemed halfwaybetween the steamboat and the Martians--a diminishing black bulkagainst the receding horizontal expanse of the Essex coast.Suddenly the foremost Martian lowered his tube and discharged acanister of the black gas at the ironclad.  It hit her larboard sideand glanced off in an inky jet that rolled away to seaward, anunfolding torrent of Black Smoke, from which the ironclad drove clear.To the watchers from the steamer, low in the water and with the sun intheir eyes, it seemed as though she were already among the Martians.They saw the gaunt figures separating and rising out of the wateras they retreated shoreward, and one of them raised the camera-likegenerator of the Heat-Ray.  He held it pointing obliquely downward,and a bank of steam sprang from the water at its touch.  It must havedriven through the iron of the ship's side like a white-hot iron rodthrough paper.A flicker of flame went up through the rising steam, and then theMartian reeled and staggered.  In another moment he was cut down, anda great body of water and steam shot high in the air.  The guns of the_Thunder Child_ sounded through the reek, going off one after the other,and one shot splashed the water high close by the steamer, ricochetedtowards the other flying ships to the north, and smashed a smack tomatchwood.But no one heeded that very much.  At the sight of the Martian'scollapse the captain on the bridge yelled inarticulately, and all thecrowding passengers on the steamer's stern shouted together.  And thenthey yelled again.  For, surging out beyond the white tumult, drovesomething long and black, the flames streaming from its middle parts,its ventilators and funnels spouting fire.She was alive still; the steering gear, it seems, was intact andher engines working.  She headed straight for a second Martian, andwas within a hundred yards of him when the Heat-Ray came to bear.  Thenwith a violent thud, a blinding flash, her decks, her funnels, leapedupward.  The Martian staggered with the violence of her explosion, andin another moment the flaming wreckage, still driving forward with theimpetus of its pace, had struck him and crumpled him up like a thingof cardboard.  My brother shouted involuntarily.  A boiling tumult ofsteam hid everything again.&quot;Two!&quot; yelled the captain.Everyone was shouting.  The whole steamer from end to end rang withfrantic cheering that was taken up first by one and then by all in thecrowding multitude of ships and boats that was driving out to sea.The steam hung upon the water for many minutes, hiding the thirdMartian and the coast altogether.  And all this time the boat waspaddling steadily out to sea and away from the fight; and when at lastthe confusion cleared, the drifting bank of black vapour intervened,and nothing of the _Thunder Child_ could be made out, nor could thethird Martian be seen.  But the ironclads to seaward were now quiteclose and standing in towards shore past the steamboat.The little vessel continued to beat its way seaward, and theironclads receded slowly towards the coast, which was hidden still bya marbled bank of vapour, part steam, part black gas, eddying andcombining in the strangest way.  The fleet of refugees was scatteringto the northeast; several smacks were sailing between the ironcladsand the steamboat.  After a time, and before they reached the sinkingcloud bank, the warships turned northward, and then abruptly wentabout and passed into the thickening haze of evening southward.  Thecoast grew faint, and at last indistinguishable amid the low banks ofclouds that were gathering about the sinking sun.Then suddenly out of the golden haze of the sunset came thevibration of guns, and a form of black shadows moving.  Everyonestruggled to the rail of the steamer and peered into the blindingfurnace of the west, but nothing was to be distinguished clearly.  Amass of smoke rose slanting and barred the face of the sun.  Thesteamboat throbbed on its way through an interminable suspense.The sun sank into grey clouds, the sky flushed and darkened, theevening star trembled into sight.  It was deep twilight when thecaptain cried out and pointed.  My brother strained his eyes.Something rushed up into the sky out of the greyness--rushedslantingly upward and very swiftly into the luminous clearness abovethe clouds in the western sky; something flat and broad, and verylarge, that swept round in a vast curve, grew smaller, sank slowly,and vanished again into the grey mystery of the night.  And as it flewit rained down darkness upon the land.BOOK TWOTHE EARTH UNDER THE MARTIANSCHAPTER ONEUNDER FOOTIn the first book I have wandered so much from my own adventures totell of the experiences of my brother that all through the last twochapters I and the curate have been lurking in the empty house atHalliford whither we fled to escape the Black Smoke.  There I willresume.  We stopped there all Sunday night and all the next day--theday of the panic--in a little island of daylight, cut off by the BlackSmoke from the rest of the world.  We could do nothing but wait inaching inactivity during those two weary days.My mind was occupied by anxiety for my wife.  I figured her atLeatherhead, terrified, in danger, mourning me already as a dead man.I paced the rooms and cried aloud when I thought of how I was cut offfrom her, of all that might happen to her in my absence.  My cousin Iknew was brave enough for any emergency, but he was not the sort ofman to realise danger quickly, to rise promptly.  What was needed nowwas not bravery, but circumspection.  My only consolation was tobelieve that the Martians were moving London-ward and away from her.Such vague anxieties keep the mind sensitive and painful.  I grew veryweary and irritable with the curate's perpetual ejaculations; I tiredof the sight of his selfish despair.  After some ineffectualremonstrance I kept away from him, staying in a room--evidently achildren's schoolroom--containing globes, forms, and copybooks.  Whenhe followed me thither, I went to a box room at the top of the houseand, in order to be alone with my aching miseries, locked myself in.We were hopelessly hemmed in by the Black Smoke all that day andthe morning of the next.  There were signs of people in the next houseon Sunday evening--a face at a window and moving lights, and later theslamming of a door.  But I do not know who these people were, nor whatbecame of them.  We saw nothing of them next day.  The Black Smokedrifted slowly riverward all through Monday morning, creeping nearerand nearer to us, driving at last along the roadway outside the housethat hid us.A Martian came across the fields about midday, laying the stuffwith a jet of superheated steam that hissed against the walls, smashedall the windows it touched, and scalded the curate's hand as he fledout of the front room.  When at last we crept across the sodden roomsand looked out again, the country northward was as though a blacksnowstorm had passed over it.  Looking towards the river, we wereastonished to see an unaccountable redness mingling with the black ofthe scorched meadows.For a time we did not see how this change affected our position,save that we were relieved of our fear of the Black Smoke.  But laterI perceived that we were no longer hemmed in, that now we might getaway.  So soon as I realised that the way of escape was open, my dreamof action returned.  But the curate was lethargic, unreasonable.&quot;We are safe here,&quot; he repeated; &quot;safe here.&quot;I resolved to leave him--would that I had!  Wiser now for theartilleryman's teaching, I sought out food and drink.  I had found oiland rags for my burns, and I also took a hat and a flannel shirt thatI found in one of the bedrooms.  When it was clear to him that I meantto go alone--had reconciled myself to going alone--he suddenly rousedhimself to come.  And all being quiet throughout the afternoon, westarted about five o'clock, as I should judge, along the blackenedroad to Sunbury.In Sunbury, and at intervals along the road, were dead bodies lyingin contorted attitudes, horses as well as men, overturned carts andluggage, all covered thickly with black dust.  That pall of cinderypowder made me think of what I had read of the destruction of Pompeii.We got to Hampton Court without misadventure, our minds full ofstrange and unfamiliar appearances, and at Hampton Court our eyes wererelieved to find a patch of green that had escaped the suffocatingdrift.  We went through Bushey Park, with its deer going to and frounder the chestnuts, and some men and women hurrying in the distancetowards Hampton, and so we came to Twickenham.  These were the firstpeople we saw.Away across the road the woods beyond Ham and Petersham were stillafire.  Twickenham was uninjured by either Heat-Ray or Black Smoke,and there were more people about here, though none could give us news.For the most part they were like ourselves, taking advantage of a lullto shift their quarters.  I have an impression that many of the houseshere were still occupied by scared inhabitants, too frightened evenfor flight.  Here too the evidence of a hasty rout was abundant alongthe road.  I remember most vividly three smashed bicycles in a heap,pounded into the road by the wheels of subsequent carts.  We crossedRichmond Bridge about half past eight.  We hurried across the exposedbridge, of course, but I noticed floating down the stream a numberof red masses, some many feet across.  I did not know what thesewere--there was no time for scrutiny--and I put a more horribleinterpretation on them than they deserved.  Here again on the Surreyside were black dust that had once been smoke, and dead bodies--a heapnear the approach to the station; but we had no glimpse of theMartians until we were some way towards Barnes.We saw in the blackened distance a group of three people runningdown a side street towards the river, but otherwise it seemeddeserted.  Up the hill Richmond town was burning briskly; outside thetown of Richmond there was no trace of the Black Smoke.Then suddenly, as we approached Kew, came a number of peoplerunning, and the upperworks of a Martian fighting-machine loomed insight over the housetops, not a hundred yards away from us.  We stoodaghast at our danger, and had the Martian looked down we mustimmediately have perished.  We were so terrified that we dared not goon, but turned aside and hid in a shed in a garden.  There the curatecrouched, weeping silently, and refusing to stir again.But my fixed idea of reaching Leatherhead would not let me rest,and in the twilight I ventured out again.  I went through a shrubbery,and along a passage beside a big house standing in its own grounds,and so emerged upon the road towards Kew.  The curate I left in theshed, but he came hurrying after me.That second start was the most foolhardy thing I ever did.  For itwas manifest the Martians were about us.  No sooner had the curateovertaken me than we saw either the fighting-machine we had seenbefore or another, far away across the meadows in the direction of KewLodge.  Four or five little black figures hurried before it across thegreen-grey of the field, and in a moment it was evident this Martianpursued them.  In three strides he was among them, and they ranradiating from his feet in all directions.  He used no Heat-Ray todestroy them, but picked them up one by one.  Apparently he tossedthem into the great metallic carrier which projected behind him, muchas a workman's basket hangs over his shoulder.It was the first time I realised that the Martians might have anyother purpose than destruction with defeated humanity.  We stood for amoment petrified, then turned and fled through a gate behind us into awalled garden, fell into, rather than found, a fortunate ditch, andlay there, scarce daring to whisper to each other until the stars wereout.I suppose it was nearly eleven o'clock before we gathered courageto start again, no longer venturing into the road, but sneaking alonghedgerows and through plantations, and watching keenly through thedarkness, he on the right and I on the left, for the Martians, whoseemed to be all about us.  In one place we blundered upon a scorchedand blackened area, now cooling and ashen, and a number of scattereddead bodies of men, burned horribly about the heads and trunks butwith their legs and boots mostly intact; and of dead horses, fiftyfeet, perhaps, behind a line of four ripped guns and smashed guncarriages.Sheen, it seemed, had escaped destruction, but the place was silentand deserted.  Here we happened on no dead, though the night was toodark for us to see into the side roads of the place.  In Sheen mycompanion suddenly complained of faintness and thirst, and we decidedto try one of the houses.The first house we entered, after a little difficulty with thewindow, was a small semi-detached villa, and I found nothing eatableleft in the place but some mouldy cheese.  There was, however, waterto drink; and I took a hatchet, which promised to be useful in ournext house-breaking.We then crossed to a place where the road turns towards Mortlake.Here there stood a white house within a walled garden, and in thepantry of this domicile we found a store of food--two loaves of breadin a pan, an uncooked steak, and the half of a ham.  I give thiscatalogue so precisely because, as it happened, we were destined tosubsist upon this store for the next fortnight.  Bottled beer stoodunder a shelf, and there were two bags of haricot beans and some limplettuces.  This pantry opened into a kind of wash-up kitchen, and inthis was firewood; there was also a cupboard, in which we found nearlya dozen of burgundy, tinned soups and salmon, and two tins ofbiscuits.We sat in the adjacent kitchen in the dark--for we dared not strikea light--and ate bread and ham, and drank beer out of the same bottle.The curate, who was still timorous and restless, was now, oddlyenough, for pushing on, and I was urging him to keep up his strengthby eating when the thing happened that was to imprison us.&quot;It can't be midnight yet,&quot; I said, and then came a blinding glareof vivid green light.  Everything in the kitchen leaped out, clearlyvisible in green and black, and vanished again.  And then followed sucha concussion as I have never heard before or since.  So close on theheels of this as to seem instantaneous came a thud behind me, a clashof glass, a crash and rattle of falling masonry all about us, and theplaster of the ceiling came down upon us, smashing into a multitude offragments upon our heads.  I was knocked headlong across the flooragainst the oven handle and stunned.  I was insensible for a longtime, the curate told me, and when I came to we were in darknessagain, and he, with a face wet, as I found afterwards, with blood froma cut forehead, was dabbing water over me.For some time I could not recollect what had happened.  Then thingscame to me slowly.  A bruise on my temple asserted itself.&quot;Are you better?&quot; asked the curate in a whisper.At last I answered him.  I sat up.&quot;Don't move,&quot; he said.  &quot;The floor is covered with smashed crockeryfrom the dresser.  You can't possibly move without making a noise, andI fancy _they_ are outside.&quot;We both sat quite silent, so that we could scarcely hear each otherbreathing.  Everything seemed deadly still, but once something nearus, some plaster or broken brickwork, slid down with a rumbling sound.Outside and very near was an intermittent, metallic rattle.&quot;That!&quot; said the curate, when presently it happened again.&quot;Yes,&quot; I said.  &quot;But what is it?&quot;&quot;A Martian!&quot; said the curate.I listened again.&quot;It was not like the Heat-Ray,&quot; I said, and for a time I wasinclined to think one of the great fighting-machines had stumbledagainst the house, as I had seen one stumble against the tower ofShepperton Church.Our situation was so strange and incomprehensible that for three orfour hours, until the dawn came, we scarcely moved.  And then the lightfiltered in, not through the window, which remained black, but througha triangular aperture between a beam and a heap of broken bricks inthe wall behind us.  The interior of the kitchen we now saw greyly forthe first time.The window had been burst in by a mass of garden mould, whichflowed over the table upon which we had been sitting and lay about ourfeet.  Outside, the soil was banked high against the house.  At thetop of the window frame we could see an uprooted drainpipe.  The floorwas littered with smashed hardware; the end of the kitchen towards thehouse was broken into, and since the daylight shone in there, it wasevident the greater part of the house had collapsed.  Contrastingvividly with this ruin was the neat dresser, stained in the fashion,pale green, and with a number of copper and tin vessels below it, thewallpaper imitating blue and white tiles, and a couple of colouredsupplements fluttering from the walls above the kitchen range.As the dawn grew clearer, we saw through the gap in the wall thebody of a Martian, standing sentinel, I suppose, over the stillglowing cylinder.  At the sight of that we crawled as circumspectly aspossible out of the twilight of the kitchen into the darkness of thescullery.Abruptly the right interpretation dawned upon my mind.&quot;The fifth cylinder,&quot; I whispered, &quot;the fifth shot from Mars, hasstruck this house and buried us under the ruins!&quot;For a time the curate was silent, and then he whispered:&quot;God have mercy upon us!&quot;I heard him presently whimpering to himself.Save for that sound we lay quite still in the scullery; I for mypart scarce dared breathe, and sat with my eyes fixed on the faintlight of the kitchen door.  I could just see the curate's face, a dim,oval shape, and his collar and cuffs.  Outside there began a metallichammering, then a violent hooting, and then again, after a quietinterval, a hissing like the hissing of an engine.  These noises, forthe most part problematical, continued intermittently, and seemed ifanything to increase in number as time wore on.  Presently a measuredthudding and a vibration that made everything about us quiver and thevessels in the pantry ring and shift, began and continued.  Once thelight was eclipsed, and the ghostly kitchen doorway became absolutelydark.  For many hours we must have crouched there, silent andshivering, until our tired attention failed. . . .At last I found myself awake and very hungry.  I am inclined tobelieve we must have spent the greater portion of a day before thatawakening.  My hunger was at a stride so insistent that it moved me toaction.  I told the curate I was going to seek food, and felt my waytowards the pantry.  He made me no answer, but so soon as I beganeating the faint noise I made stirred him up and I heard him crawlingafter me.CHAPTER TWOWHAT WE SAW FROM THE RUINED HOUSEAfter eating we crept back to the scullery, and there I must havedozed again, for when presently I looked round I was alone.  Thethudding vibration continued with wearisome persistence.  I whisperedfor the curate several times, and at last felt my way to the door ofthe kitchen.  It was still daylight, and I perceived him across theroom, lying against the triangular hole that looked out upon theMartians.  His shoulders were hunched, so that his head was hiddenfrom me.I could hear a number of noises almost like those in an engineshed; and the place rocked with that beating thud.  Through theaperture in the wall I could see the top of a tree touched with goldand the warm blue of a tranquil evening sky.  For a minute or so Iremained watching the curate, and then I advanced, crouching andstepping with extreme care amid the broken crockery that littered thefloor.I touched the curate's leg, and he started so violently that a massof plaster went sliding down outside and fell with a loud impact.  Igripped his arm, fearing he might cry out, and for a long time wecrouched motionless.  Then I turned to see how much of our rampartremained.  The detachment of the plaster had left a vertical slit openin the debris, and by raising myself cautiously across a beam I wasable to see out of this gap into what had been overnight a quietsuburban roadway.  Vast, indeed, was the change that we beheld.The fifth cylinder must have fallen right into the midst of thehouse we had first visited.  The building had vanished, completelysmashed, pulverised, and dispersed by the blow.  The cylinder lay nowfar beneath the original foundations--deep in a hole, already vastlylarger than the pit I had looked into at Woking.  The earth all roundit had splashed under that tremendous impact--&quot;splashed&quot; is the onlyword--and lay in heaped piles that hid the masses of the adjacenthouses.  It had behaved exactly like mud under the violent blow of ahammer.  Our house had collapsed backward; the front portion, even onthe ground floor, had been destroyed completely; by a chance thekitchen and scullery had escaped, and stood buried now under soil andruins, closed in by tons of earth on every side save towards thecylinder.  Over that aspect we hung now on the very edge of the greatcircular pit the Martians were engaged in making.  The heavy beatingsound was evidently just behind us, and ever and again a bright greenvapour drove up like a veil across our peephole.The cylinder was already opened in the centre of the pit, and onthe farther edge of the pit, amid the smashed and gravel-heapedshrubbery, one of the great fighting-machines, deserted by itsoccupant, stood stiff and tall against the evening sky.  At first Iscarcely noticed the pit and the cylinder, although it has beenconvenient to describe them first, on account of the extraordinaryglittering mechanism I saw busy in the excavation, and on account ofthe strange creatures that were crawling slowly and painfully acrossthe heaped mould near it.The mechanism it certainly was that held my attention first.  Itwas one of those complicated fabrics that have since been calledhandling-machines, and the study of which has already given such anenormous impetus to terrestrial invention.  As it dawned upon mefirst, it presented a sort of metallic spider with five jointed,agile legs, and with an extraordinary number of jointed levers, bars,and reaching and clutching tentacles about its body.  Most of itsarms were retracted, but with three long tentacles it was fishingout a number of rods, plates, and bars which lined the covering andapparently strengthened the walls of the cylinder.  These, as itextracted them, were lifted out and deposited upon a level surfaceof earth behind it.Its motion was so swift, complex, and perfect that at first I didnot see it as a machine, in spite of its metallic glitter.  Thefighting-machines were coordinated and animated to an extraordinarypitch, but nothing to compare with this.  People who have never seenthese structures, and have only the ill-imagined efforts of artists orthe imperfect descriptions of such eye-witnesses as myself to go upon,scarcely realise that living quality.I recall particularly the illustration of one of the firstpamphlets to give a consecutive account of the war.  The artist hadevidently made a hasty study of one of the fighting-machines, andthere his knowledge ended.  He presented them as tilted, stifftripods, without either flexibility or subtlety, and with analtogether misleading monotony of effect.  The pamphlet containingthese renderings had a considerable vogue, and I mention them heresimply to warn the reader against the impression they may havecreated.  They were no more like the Martians I saw in action than aDutch doll is like a human being.  To my mind, the pamphlet would havebeen much better without them.At first, I say, the handling-machine did not impress me as amachine, but as a crablike creature with a glittering integument, thecontrolling Martian whose delicate tentacles actuated its movementsseeming to be simply the equivalent of the crab's cerebral portion.But then I perceived the resemblance of its grey-brown, shiny,leathery integument to that of the other sprawling bodies beyond, andthe true nature of this dexterous workman dawned upon me.  With thatrealisation my interest shifted to those other creatures, the realMartians.  Already I had had a transient impression of these, and thefirst nausea no longer obscured my observation.  Moreover, I wasconcealed and motionless, and under no urgency of action.They were, I now saw, the most unearthly creatures it is possibleto conceive.  They were huge round bodies--or, rather, heads--aboutfour feet in diameter, each body having in front of it a face.  Thisface had no nostrils--indeed, the Martians do not seem to have had anysense of smell, but it had a pair of very large dark-coloured eyes,and just beneath this a kind of fleshy beak.  In the back of this heador body--I scarcely know how to speak of it--was the single tighttympanic surface, since known to be anatomically an ear, though itmust have been almost useless in our dense air.  In a group round themouth were sixteen slender, almost whiplike tentacles, arranged in twobunches of eight each.  These bunches have since been named ratheraptly, by that distinguished anatomist, Professor Howes, the _hands_.Even as I saw these Martians for the first time they seemed to beendeavouring to raise themselves on these hands, but of course, withthe increased weight of terrestrial conditions, this was impossible.There is reason to suppose that on Mars they may have progressed uponthem with some facility.The internal anatomy, I may remark here, as dissection has sinceshown, was almost equally simple.  The greater part of the structurewas the brain, sending enormous nerves to the eyes, ear, and tactiletentacles.  Besides this were the bulky lungs, into which the mouthopened, and the heart and its vessels.  The pulmonary distress causedby the denser atmosphere and greater gravitational attraction was onlytoo evident in the convulsive movements of the outer skin.And this was the sum of the Martian organs.  Strange as it may seemto a human being, all the complex apparatus of digestion, which makesup the bulk of our bodies, did not exist in the Martians.  They wereheads--merely heads.  Entrails they had none.  They did not eat, muchless digest.  Instead, they took the fresh, living blood of othercreatures, and _injected_ it into their own veins.  I have myself seenthis being done, as I shall mention in its place.  But, squeamish as Imay seem, I cannot bring myself to describe what I could not endureeven to continue watching.  Let it suffice to say, blood obtained froma still living animal, in most cases from a human being, was rundirectly by means of a little pipette into the recipient canal. . . .The bare idea of this is no doubt horribly repulsive to us, but atthe same time I think that we should remember how repulsive ourcarnivorous habits would seem to an intelligent rabbit.The physiological advantages of the practice of injection areundeniable, if one thinks of the tremendous waste of human time andenergy occasioned by eating and the digestive process.  Our bodies arehalf made up of glands and tubes and organs, occupied in turningheterogeneous food into blood.  The digestive processes and theirreaction upon the nervous system sap our strength and colour ourminds.  Men go happy or miserable as they have healthy or unhealthylivers, or sound gastric glands.  But the Martians were lifted aboveall these organic fluctuations of mood and emotion.Their undeniable preference for men as their source of nourishmentis partly explained by the nature of the remains of the victims theyhad brought with them as provisions from Mars.  These creatures, tojudge from the shrivelled remains that have fallen into human hands,were bipeds with flimsy, silicious skeletons (almost like those of thesilicious sponges) and feeble musculature, standing about six feethigh and having round, erect heads, and large eyes in flinty sockets.Two or three of these seem to have been brought in each cylinder, andall were killed before earth was reached.  It was just as well forthem, for the mere attempt to stand upright upon our planet would havebroken every bone in their bodies.And while I am engaged in this description, I may add in this placecertain further details which, although they were not all evident tous at the time, will enable the reader who is unacquainted with themto form a clearer picture of these offensive creatures.In three other points their physiology differed strangely fromours.  Their organisms did not sleep, any more than the heart of mansleeps.  Since they had no extensive muscular mechanism to recuperate,that periodical extinction was unknown to them.  They had little orno sense of fatigue, it would seem.  On earth they could never havemoved without effort, yet even to the last they kept in action.  Intwenty-four hours they did twenty-four hours of work, as even on earthis perhaps the case with the ants.In the next place, wonderful as it seems in a sexual world, theMartians were absolutely without sex, and therefore without any of thetumultuous emotions that arise from that difference among men.  Ayoung Martian, there can now be no dispute, was really born upon earthduring the war, and it was found attached to its parent, partially_budded_ off, just as young lilybulbs bud off, or like the young animalsin the fresh-water polyp.In man, in all the higher terrestrial animals, such a method ofincrease has disappeared; but even on this earth it was certainly theprimitive method.  Among the lower animals, up even to those firstcousins of the vertebrated animals, the Tunicates, the two processesoccur side by side, but finally the sexual method superseded itscompetitor altogether.  On Mars, however, just the reverse hasapparently been the case.It is worthy of remark that a certain speculative writer ofquasi-scientific repute, writing long before the Martian invasion, didforecast for man a final structure not unlike the actual Martiancondition.  His prophecy, I remember, appeared in November orDecember, 1893, in a long-defunct publication, the _Pall Mall Budget_,and I recall a caricature of it in a pre-Martian periodical called_Punch_.  He pointed out--writing in a foolish, facetious tone--that theperfection of mechanical appliances must ultimately supersede limbs;the perfection of chemical devices, digestion; that such organs ashair, external nose, teeth, ears, and chin were no longer essentialparts of the human being, and that the tendency of natural selectionwould lie in the direction of their steady diminution through thecoming ages.  The brain alone remained a cardinal necessity.  Only oneother part of the body had a strong case for survival, and that wasthe hand, &quot;teacher and agent of the brain.&quot;  While the rest of thebody dwindled, the hands would grow larger.There is many a true word written in jest, and here in the Martianswe have beyond dispute the actual accomplishment of such a suppressionof the animal side of the organism by the intelligence.  To me it isquite credible that the Martians may be descended from beings notunlike ourselves, by a gradual development of brain and hands (thelatter giving rise to the two bunches of delicate tentacles at last)at the expense of the rest of the body.  Without the body the brainwould, of course, become a mere selfish intelligence, without any ofthe emotional substratum of the human being.The last salient point in which the systems of these creaturesdiffered from ours was in what one might have thought a very trivialparticular.  Micro-organisms, which cause so much disease and pain onearth, have either never appeared upon Mars or Martian sanitaryscience eliminated them ages ago.  A hundred diseases, all the feversand contagions of human life, consumption, cancers, tumours and suchmorbidities, never enter the scheme of their life.  And speaking ofthe differences between the life on Mars and terrestrial life, I mayallude here to the curious suggestions of the red weed.Apparently the vegetable kingdom in Mars, instead of having greenfor a dominant colour, is of a vivid blood-red tint.  At any rate, theseeds which the Martians (intentionally or accidentally) brought withthem gave rise in all cases to red-coloured growths.  Only that knownpopularly as the red weed, however, gained any footing in competitionwith terrestrial forms.  The red creeper was quite a transitorygrowth, and few people have seen it growing.  For a time, however, thered weed grew with astonishing vigour and luxuriance.  It spread upthe sides of the pit by the third or fourth day of our imprisonment,and its cactus-like branches formed a carmine fringe to the edges ofour triangular window.  And afterwards I found it broadcast throughoutthe country, and especially wherever there was a stream of water.The Martians had what appears to have been an auditory organ, asingle round drum at the back of the head-body, and eyes with a visualrange not very different from ours except that, according to Philips,blue and violet were as black to them.  It is commonly supposed thatthey communicated by sounds and tentacular gesticulations; this isasserted, for instance, in the able but hastily compiled pamphlet(written evidently by someone not an eye-witness of Martian actions)to which I have already alluded, and which, so far, has been the chiefsource of information concerning them.  Now no surviving human beingsaw so much of the Martians in action as I did.  I take no credit tomyself for an accident, but the fact is so.  And I assert that Iwatched them closely time after time, and that I have seen four, five,and (once) six of them sluggishly performing the most elaboratelycomplicated operations together without either sound or gesture.  Theirpeculiar hooting invariably preceded feeding; it had no modulation,and was, I believe, in no sense a signal, but merely the expiration ofair preparatory to the suctional operation.  I have a certain claim toat least an elementary knowledge of psychology, and in this matter Iam convinced--as firmly as I am convinced of anything--that theMartians interchanged thoughts without any physical intermediation.And I have been convinced of this in spite of strong preconceptions.Before the Martian invasion, as an occasional reader here or there mayremember, I had written with some little vehemence against thetelepathic theory.The Martians wore no clothing.  Their conceptions of ornament anddecorum were necessarily different from ours; and not only were theyevidently much less sensible of changes of temperature than we are,but changes of pressure do not seem to have affected their health atall seriously.  Yet though they wore no clothing, it was in the otherartificial additions to their bodily resources that their greatsuperiority over man lay.  We men, with our bicycles and road-skates,our Lilienthal soaring-machines, our guns and sticks and so forth, arejust in the beginning of the evolution that the Martians have workedout.  They have become practically mere brains, wearing differentbodies according to their needs just as men wear suits of clothes andtake a bicycle in a hurry or an umbrella in the wet.  And of theirappliances, perhaps nothing is more wonderful to a man than thecurious fact that what is the dominant feature of almost all humandevices in mechanism is absent--the _wheel_ is absent; among all thethings they brought to earth there is no trace or suggestion of theiruse of wheels.  One would have at least expected it in locomotion.  Andin this connection it is curious to remark that even on this earthNature has never hit upon the wheel, or has preferred other expedientsto its development.  And not only did the Martians either not know of(which is incredible), or abstain from, the wheel, but in theirapparatus singularly little use is made of the fixed pivot orrelatively fixed pivot, with circular motions thereabout confinedto one plane.  Almost all the joints of the machinery present acomplicated system of sliding parts moving over small but beautifullycurved friction bearings.  And while upon this matter of detail, it isremarkable that the long leverages of their machines are in most casesactuated by a sort of sham musculature of the disks in an elasticsheath; these disks become polarised and drawn closely and powerfullytogether when traversed by a current of electricity.  In this way thecurious parallelism to animal motions, which was so striking anddisturbing to the human beholder, was attained.  Such quasi-musclesabounded in the crablike handling-machine which, on my first peepingout of the slit, I watched unpacking the cylinder.  It seemedinfinitely more alive than the actual Martians lying beyond it in thesunset light, panting, stirring ineffectual tentacles, and movingfeebly after their vast journey across space.While I was still watching their sluggish motions in the sunlight,and noting each strange detail of their form, the curate reminded meof his presence by pulling violently at my arm.  I turned to ascowling face, and silent, eloquent lips.  He wanted the slit, whichpermitted only one of us to peep through; and so I had to foregowatching them for a time while he enjoyed that privilege.When I looked again, the busy handling-machine had already puttogether several of the pieces of apparatus it had taken out of thecylinder into a shape having an unmistakable likeness to its own; anddown on the left a busy little digging mechanism had come into view,emitting jets of green vapour and working its way round the pit,excavating and embanking in a methodical and discriminating manner.This it was which had caused the regular beating noise, and therhythmic shocks that had kept our ruinous refuge quivering.  It pipedand whistled as it worked.  So far as I could see, the thing waswithout a directing Martian at all.CHAPTER THREETHE DAYS OF IMPRISONMENTThe arrival of a second fighting-machine drove us from our peepholeinto the scullery, for we feared that from his elevation the Martianmight see down upon us behind our barrier.  At a later date we beganto feel less in danger of their eyes, for to an eye in the dazzle ofthe sunlight outside our refuge must have been blank blackness, but atfirst the slightest suggestion of approach drove us into the sculleryin heart-throbbing retreat.  Yet terrible as was the danger weincurred, the attraction of peeping was for both of us irresistible.And I recall now with a sort of wonder that, in spite of the infinitedanger in which we were between starvation and a still more terribledeath, we could yet struggle bitterly for that horrible privilege ofsight.  We would race across the kitchen in a grotesque way betweeneagerness and the dread of making a noise, and strike each other, andthrust and kick, within a few inches of exposure.The fact is that we had absolutely incompatible dispositions andhabits of thought and action, and our danger and isolation onlyaccentuated the incompatibility.  At Halliford I had already come tohate the curate's trick of helpless exclamation, his stupid rigidityof mind.  His endless muttering monologue vitiated every effort I madeto think out a line of action, and drove me at times, thus pent up andintensified, almost to the verge of craziness.  He was as lacking inrestraint as a silly woman.  He would weep for hours together, and Iverily believe that to the very end this spoiled child of life thoughthis weak tears in some way efficacious.  And I would sit in thedarkness unable to keep my mind off him by reason of hisimportunities.  He ate more than I did, and it was in vain I pointedout that our only chance of life was to stop in the house until theMartians had done with their pit, that in that long patience a timemight presently come when we should need food.  He ate and drankimpulsively in heavy meals at long intervals.  He slept little.As the days wore on, his utter carelessness of any consideration sointensified our distress and danger that I had, much as I loatheddoing it, to resort to threats, and at last to blows.  That brought himto reason for a time.  But he was one of those weak creatures, void ofpride, timorous, anaemic, hateful souls, full of shifty cunning, whoface neither God nor man, who face not even themselves.It is disagreeable for me to recall and write these things, but Iset them down that my story may lack nothing.  Those who have escapedthe dark and terrible aspects of life will find my brutality, my flashof rage in our final tragedy, easy enough to blame; for they know whatis wrong as well as any, but not what is possible to tortured men.  Butthose who have been under the shadow, who have gone down at last toelemental things, will have a wider charity.And while within we fought out our dark, dim contest of whispers,snatched food and drink, and gripping hands and blows, without, in thepitiless sunlight of that terrible June, was the strange wonder, theunfamiliar routine of the Martians in the pit.  Let me return to thosefirst new experiences of mine.  After a long time I ventured back tothe peephole, to find that the new-comers had been reinforced by theoccupants of no fewer than three of the fighting-machines.  These lasthad brought with them certain fresh appliances that stood in anorderly manner about the cylinder.  The second handling-machine was nowcompleted, and was busied in serving one of the novel contrivances thebig machine had brought.  This was a body resembling a milk can in itsgeneral form, above which oscillated a pear-shaped receptacle, andfrom which a stream of white powder flowed into a circular basinbelow.The oscillatory motion was imparted to this by one tentacle of thehandling-machine.  With two spatulate hands the handling-machine wasdigging out and flinging masses of clay into the pear-shapedreceptacle above, while with another arm it periodically opened a doorand removed rusty and blackened clinkers from the middle part of themachine.  Another steely tentacle directed the powder from the basinalong a ribbed channel towards some receiver that was hidden from meby the mound of bluish dust.  From this unseen receiver a littlethread of green smoke rose vertically into the quiet air.  As I looked,the handling-machine, with a faint and musical clinking, extended,telescopic fashion, a tentacle that had been a moment before a mereblunt projection, until its end was hidden behind the mound of clay.In another second it had lifted a bar of white aluminium into sight,untarnished as yet, and shining dazzlingly, and deposited it in agrowing stack of bars that stood at the side of the pit.  Betweensunset and starlight this dexterous machine must have made more than ahundred such bars out of the crude clay, and the mound of bluish dustrose steadily until it topped the side of the pit.The contrast between the swift and complex movements of thesecontrivances and the inert panting clumsiness of their masters wasacute, and for days I had to tell myself repeatedly that these latterwere indeed the living of the two things.The curate had possession of the slit when the first men werebrought to the pit.  I was sitting below, huddled up, listening withall my ears.  He made a sudden movement backward, and I, fearful thatwe were observed, crouched in a spasm of terror.  He came sliding downthe rubbish and crept beside me in the darkness, inarticulate,gesticulating, and for a moment I shared his panic.  His gesturesuggested a resignation of the slit, and after a little while mycuriosity gave me courage, and I rose up, stepped across him, andclambered up to it.  At first I could see no reason for his franticbehaviour.  The twilight had now come, the stars were little andfaint, but the pit was illuminated by the flickering green fire thatcame from the aluminium-making.  The whole picture was a flickeringscheme of green gleams and shifting rusty black shadows, strangelytrying to the eyes.  Over and through it all went the bats, heeding itnot at all.  The sprawling Martians were no longer to be seen, themound of blue-green powder had risen to cover them from sight, and afighting-machine, with its legs contracted, crumpled, and abbreviated,stood across the corner of the pit.  And then, amid the clangour ofthe machinery, came a drifting suspicion of human voices, that Ientertained at first only to dismiss.I crouched, watching this fighting-machine closely, satisfyingmyself now for the first time that the hood did indeed contain aMartian.  As the green flames lifted I could see the oily gleam ofhis integument and the brightness of his eyes.  And suddenly I hearda yell, and saw a long tentacle reaching over the shoulder of themachine to the little cage that hunched upon its back.  Thensomething--something struggling violently--was lifted high against thesky, a black, vague enigma against the starlight; and as this blackobject came down again, I saw by the green brightness that it was aman.  For an instant he was clearly visible.  He was a stout, ruddy,middle-aged man, well dressed; three days before, he must have beenwalking the world, a man of considerable consequence.  I could see hisstaring eyes and gleams of light on his studs and watch chain.  Hevanished behind the mound, and for a moment there was silence.  Andthen began a shrieking and a sustained and cheerful hooting from theMartians.I slid down the rubbish, struggled to my feet, clapped my handsover my ears, and bolted into the scullery.  The curate, who had beencrouching silently with his arms over his head, looked up as I passed,cried out quite loudly at my desertion of him, and came running afterme.That night, as we lurked in the scullery, balanced between ourhorror and the terrible fascination this peeping had, although I feltan urgent need of action I tried in vain to conceive some plan ofescape; but afterwards, during the second day, I was able to considerour position with great clearness.  The curate, I found, was quiteincapable of discussion; this new and culminating atrocity had robbedhim of all vestiges of reason or forethought.  Practically he hadalready sunk to the level of an animal.  But as the saying goes, Igripped myself with both hands.  It grew upon my mind, once I couldface the facts, that terrible as our position was, there was as yetno justification for absolute despair.  Our chief chance lay in thepossibility of the Martians making the pit nothing more than atemporary encampment.  Or even if they kept it permanently, they mightnot consider it necessary to guard it, and a chance of escape might beafforded us.  I also weighed very carefully the possibility of ourdigging a way out in a direction away from the pit, but the chances ofour emerging within sight of some sentinel fighting-machine seemed atfirst too great.  And I should have had to do all the digging myself.The curate would certainly have failed me.It was on the third day, if my memory serves me right, that I sawthe lad killed.  It was the only occasion on which I actually saw theMartians feed.  After that experience I avoided the hole in the wallfor the better part of a day.  I went into the scullery, removed thedoor, and spent some hours digging with my hatchet as silently aspossible; but when I had made a hole about a couple of feet deep theloose earth collapsed noisily, and I did not dare continue.  I lostheart, and lay down on the scullery floor for a long time, having nospirit even to move.  And after that I abandoned altogether the ideaof escaping by excavation.It says much for the impression the Martians had made upon me thatat first I entertained little or no hope of our escape being broughtabout by their overthrow through any human effort.  But on the fourthor fifth night I heard a sound like heavy guns.It was very late in the night, and the moon was shining brightly.The Martians had taken away the excavating-machine, and, save for afighting-machine that stood in the remoter bank of the pit and ahandling-machine that was buried out of my sight in a corner of thepit immediately beneath my peephole, the place was deserted by them.Except for the pale glow from the handling-machine and the bars andpatches of white moonlight the pit was in darkness, and, except forthe clinking of the handling-machine, quite still.  That night was abeautiful serenity; save for one planet, the moon seemed to have thesky to herself.  I heard a dog howling, and that familiar sound it wasthat made me listen.  Then I heard quite distinctly a booming exactlylike the sound of great guns.  Six distinct reports I counted, andafter a long interval six again.  And that was all.CHAPTER FOURTHE DEATH OF THE CURATEIt was on the sixth day of our imprisonment that I peeped for thelast time, and presently found myself alone.  Instead of keeping closeto me and trying to oust me from the slit, the curate had gone backinto the scullery.  I was struck by a sudden thought.  I went backquickly and quietly into the scullery.  In the darkness I heard thecurate drinking.  I snatched in the darkness, and my fingers caught abottle of burgundy.For a few minutes there was a tussle.  The bottle struck the floorand broke, and I desisted and rose.  We stood panting and threateningeach other.  In the end I planted myself between him and the food, andtold him of my determination to begin a discipline.  I divided thefood in the pantry, into rations to last us ten days.  I would not lethim eat any more that day.  In the afternoon he made a feeble effortto get at the food.  I had been dozing, but in an instant I was awake.All day and all night we sat face to face, I weary but resolute, andhe weeping and complaining of his immediate hunger.  It was, I know, anight and a day, but to me it seemed--it seems now--an interminablelength of time.And so our widened incompatibility ended at last in open conflict.For two vast days we struggled in undertones and wrestling contests.There were times when I beat and kicked him madly, times when Icajoled and persuaded him, and once I tried to bribe him with the lastbottle of burgundy, for there was a rain-water pump from which I couldget water.  But neither force nor kindness availed; he was indeedbeyond reason.  He would neither desist from his attacks on the foodnor from his noisy babbling to himself.  The rudimentary precautionsto keep our imprisonment endurable he would not observe.  Slowly Ibegan to realise the complete overthrow of his intelligence, toperceive that my sole companion in this close and sickly darkness wasa man insane.From certain vague memories I am inclined to think my own mindwandered at times.  I had strange and hideous dreams whenever I slept.It sounds paradoxical, but I am inclined to think that the weaknessand insanity of the curate warned me, braced me, and kept me a saneman.On the eighth day he began to talk aloud instead of whispering, andnothing I could do would moderate his speech.&quot;It is just, O God!&quot; he would say, over and over again. &quot;It isjust.  On me and mine be the punishment laid.  We have sinned, we havefallen short.  There was poverty, sorrow; the poor were trodden inthe dust, and I held my peace.  I preached acceptable folly--my God,what folly!--when I should have stood up, though I died for it, andcalled upon them to repent--repent! . . .  Oppressors of the poor andneedy . . . !  The wine press of God!&quot;Then he would suddenly revert to the matter of the food I withheldfrom him, praying, begging, weeping, at last threatening.  He began toraise his voice--I prayed him not to.  He perceived a hold on me--hethreatened he would shout and bring the Martians upon us.  For a timethat scared me; but any concession would have shortened our chance ofescape beyond estimating.  I defied him, although I felt no assurancethat he might not do this thing.  But that day, at any rate, he didnot.  He talked with his voice rising slowly, through the greater partof the eighth and ninth days--threats, entreaties, mingled with atorrent of half-sane and always frothy repentance for his vacant shamof God's service, such as made me pity him.  Then he slept awhile, andbegan again with renewed strength, so loudly that I must needs makehim desist.&quot;Be still!&quot; I implored.He rose to his knees, for he had been sitting in the darkness nearthe copper.&quot;I have been still too long,&quot; he said, in a tone that must havereached the pit, &quot;and now I must bear my witness.  Woe unto thisunfaithful city!  Woe!  Woe!  Woe!  Woe!  Woe! To the inhabitants ofthe earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet----&quot;&quot;Shut up!&quot; I said, rising to my feet, and in a terror lest theMartians should hear us.  &quot;For God's sake----&quot;&quot;Nay,&quot; shouted the curate, at the top of his voice, standinglikewise and extending his arms.  &quot;Speak!  The word of the Lord isupon me!&quot;In three strides he was at the door leading into the kitchen.&quot;I must bear my witness!  I go!  It has already been too longdelayed.&quot;I put out my hand and felt the meat chopper hanging to the wall.In a flash I was after him.  I was fierce with fear.  Before he washalfway across the kitchen I had overtaken him.  With one last touchof humanity I turned the blade back and struck him with the butt.  Hewent headlong forward and lay stretched on the ground.  I stumbledover him and stood panting.  He lay still.Suddenly I heard a noise without, the run and smash of slippingplaster, and the triangular aperture in the wall was darkened.  Ilooked up and saw the lower surface of a handling-machine comingslowly across the hole.  One of its gripping limbs curled amid thedebris; another limb appeared, feeling its way over the fallen beams.I stood petrified, staring.  Then I saw through a sort of glass platenear the edge of the body the face, as we may call it, and the largedark eyes of a Martian, peering, and then a long metallic snake oftentacle came feeling slowly through the hole.I turned by an effort, stumbled over the curate, and stopped at thescullery door.  The tentacle was now some way, two yards or more, inthe room, and twisting and turning, with queer sudden movements, thisway and that.  For a while I stood fascinated by that slow, fitfuladvance.  Then, with a faint, hoarse cry, I forced myself across thescullery.  I trembled violently; I could scarcely stand upright.  Iopened the door of the coal cellar, and stood there in the darknessstaring at the faintly lit doorway into the kitchen, and listening.Had the Martian seen me?  What was it doing now?Something was moving to and fro there, very quietly; every now andthen it tapped against the wall, or started on its movements with afaint metallic ringing, like the movements of keys on a split-ring.Then a heavy body--I knew too well what--was dragged across the floorof the kitchen towards the opening.  Irresistibly attracted, I creptto the door and peeped into the kitchen.  In the triangle of brightouter sunlight I saw the Martian, in its Briareus of a handling-machine,scrutinizing the curate's head.  I thought at once that it would infermy presence from the mark of the blow I had given him.I crept back to the coal cellar, shut the door, and began to covermyself up as much as I could, and as noiselessly as possible in thedarkness, among the firewood and coal therein.  Every now and then Ipaused, rigid, to hear if the Martian had thrust its tentacles throughthe opening again.Then the faint metallic jingle returned.  I traced it slowlyfeeling over the kitchen.  Presently I heard it nearer--in thescullery, as I judged.  I thought that its length might beinsufficient to reach me.  I prayed copiously.  It passed, scrapingfaintly across the cellar door.  An age of almost intolerable suspenseintervened; then I heard it fumbling at the latch! It had found thedoor!  The Martians understood doors!It worried at the catch for a minute, perhaps, and then the dooropened.In the darkness I could just see the thing--like an elephant'strunk more than anything else--waving towards me and touching andexamining the wall, coals, wood and ceiling.  It was like a black wormswaying its blind head to and fro.Once, even, it touched the heel of my boot.  I was on the verge ofscreaming; I bit my hand.  For a time the tentacle was silent.  Icould have fancied it had been withdrawn.  Presently, with an abruptclick, it gripped something--I thought it had me!--and seemed to goout of the cellar again.  For a minute I was not sure.  Apparently ithad taken a lump of coal to examine.I seized the opportunity of slightly shifting my position, whichhad become cramped, and then listened.  I whispered passionate prayersfor safety.Then I heard the slow, deliberate sound creeping towards me again.Slowly, slowly it drew near, scratching against the walls and tappingthe furniture.While I was still doubtful, it rapped smartly against the cellardoor and closed it.  I heard it go into the pantry, and the biscuit-tinsrattled and a bottle smashed, and then came a heavy bump againstthe cellar door.  Then silence that passed into an infinity ofsuspense.Had it gone?At last I decided that it had.It came into the scullery no more; but I lay all the tenth day inthe close darkness, buried among coals and firewood, not daring evento crawl out for the drink for which I craved.  It was the eleventh daybefore I ventured so far from my security.CHAPTER FIVETHE STILLNESSMy first act before I went into the pantry was to fasten the doorbetween the kitchen and the scullery.  But the pantry was empty; everyscrap of food had gone.  Apparently, the Martian had taken it all onthe previous day.  At that discovery I despaired for the first time.  Itook no food, or no drink either, on the eleventh or the twelfth day.At first my mouth and throat were parched, and my strength ebbedsensibly.  I sat about in the darkness of the scullery, in a state ofdespondent wretchedness.  My mind ran on eating.  I thought I hadbecome deaf, for the noises of movement I had been accustomed to hearfrom the pit had ceased absolutely.  I did not feel strong enough tocrawl noiselessly to the peephole, or I would have gone there.On the twelfth day my throat was so painful that, taking the chanceof alarming the Martians, I attacked the creaking rain-water pump thatstood by the sink, and got a couple of glassfuls of blackened andtainted rain water.  I was greatly refreshed by this, and emboldenedby the fact that no enquiring tentacle followed the noise of mypumping.During these days, in a rambling, inconclusive way, I thought muchof the curate and of the manner of his death.On the thirteenth day I drank some more water, and dozed andthought disjointedly of eating and of vague impossible plans ofescape.  Whenever I dozed I dreamt of horrible phantasms, of the deathof the curate, or of sumptuous dinners; but, asleep or awake, I felt akeen pain that urged me to drink again and again.  The light that cameinto the scullery was no longer grey, but red.  To my disorderedimagination it seemed the colour of blood.On the fourteenth day I went into the kitchen, and I was surprisedto find that the fronds of the red weed had grown right acrossthe hole in the wall, turning the half-light of the place into acrimson-coloured obscurity.It was early on the fifteenth day that I heard a curious, familiarsequence of sounds in the kitchen, and, listening, identified it asthe snuffing and scratching of a dog.  Going into the kitchen, I saw adog's nose peering in through a break among the ruddy fronds.  Thisgreatly surprised me.  At the scent of me he barked shortly.I thought if I could induce him to come into the place quietly Ishould be able, perhaps, to kill and eat him; and in any case, itwould be advisable to kill him, lest his actions attracted theattention of the Martians.I crept forward, saying &quot;Good dog!&quot; very softly; but he suddenlywithdrew his head and disappeared.I listened--I was not deaf--but certainly the pit was still.  Iheard a sound like the flutter of a bird's wings, and a hoarsecroaking, but that was all.For a long while I lay close to the peephole, but not daring tomove aside the red plants that obscured it.  Once or twice I heard afaint pitter-patter like the feet of the dog going hither and thitheron the sand far below me, and there were more birdlike sounds, butthat was all.  At length, encouraged by the silence, I looked out.Except in the corner, where a multitude of crows hopped and foughtover the skeletons of the dead the Martians had consumed, there wasnot a living thing in the pit.I stared about me, scarcely believing my eyes.  All the machineryhad gone.  Save for the big mound of greyish-blue powder in onecorner, certain bars of aluminium in another, the black birds, and theskeletons of the killed, the place was merely an empty circular pit inthe sand.Slowly I thrust myself out through the red weed, and stood upon themound of rubble.  I could see in any direction save behind me, to thenorth, and neither Martians nor sign of Martians were to be seen.  Thepit dropped sheerly from my feet, but a little way along the rubbishafforded a practicable slope to the summit of the ruins.  My chance ofescape had come.  I began to tremble.I hesitated for some time, and then, in a gust of desperateresolution, and with a heart that throbbed violently, I scrambled tothe top of the mound in which I had been buried so long.I looked about again.  To the northward, too, no Martian wasvisible.When I had last seen this part of Sheen in the daylight it had beena straggling street of comfortable white and red houses, interspersedwith abundant shady trees.  Now I stood on a mound of smashedbrickwork, clay, and gravel, over which spread a multitude of redcactus-shaped plants, knee-high, without a solitary terrestrial growthto dispute their footing.  The trees near me were dead and brown, butfurther a network of red thread scaled the still living stems.The neighbouring houses had all been wrecked, but none had beenburned; their walls stood, sometimes to the second story, with smashedwindows and shattered doors.  The red weed grew tumultuously in theirroofless rooms.  Below me was the great pit, with the crows strugglingfor its refuse.  A number of other birds hopped about among the ruins.Far away I saw a gaunt cat slink crouchingly along a wall, but tracesof men there were none.The day seemed, by contrast with my recent confinement, dazzlinglybright, the sky a glowing blue.  A gentle breeze kept the red weedthat covered every scrap of unoccupied ground gently swaying.  And oh!the sweetness of the air!CHAPTER SIXTHE WORK OF FIFTEEN DAYSFor some time I stood tottering on the mound regardless of mysafety.  Within that noisome den from which I had emerged I hadthought with a narrow intensity only of our immediate security.  I hadnot realised what had been happening to the world, had not anticipatedthis startling vision of unfamiliar things.  I had expected to seeSheen in ruins--I found about me the landscape, weird and lurid, ofanother planet.For that moment I touched an emotion beyond the common range ofmen, yet one that the poor brutes we dominate know only too well.  Ifelt as a rabbit might feel returning to his burrow and suddenlyconfronted by the work of a dozen busy navvies digging the foundationsof a house.  I felt the first inkling of a thing that presently grewquite clear in my mind, that oppressed me for many days, a sense ofdethronement, a persuasion that I was no longer a master, but ananimal among the animals, under the Martian heel.  With us it would beas with them, to lurk and watch, to run and hide; the fear and empireof man had passed away.But so soon as this strangeness had been realised it passed, and mydominant motive became the hunger of my long and dismal fast.  In thedirection away from the pit I saw, beyond a red-covered wall, a patchof garden ground unburied.  This gave me a hint, and I went knee-deep,and sometimes neck-deep, in the red weed.  The density of theweed gave me a reassuring sense of hiding.  The wall was some six feethigh, and when I attempted to clamber it I found I could not lift myfeet to the crest.  So I went along by the side of it, and came to acorner and a rockwork that enabled me to get to the top, and tumbleinto the garden I coveted.  Here I found some young onions, a coupleof gladiolus bulbs, and a quantity of immature carrots, all of which Isecured, and, scrambling over a ruined wall, went on my way throughscarlet and crimson trees towards Kew--it was like walking through anavenue of gigantic blood drops--possessed with two ideas: to get morefood, and to limp, as soon and as far as my strength permitted, out ofthis accursed unearthly region of the pit.Some way farther, in a grassy place, was a group of mushrooms whichalso I devoured, and then I came upon a brown sheet of flowing shallowwater, where meadows used to be.  These fragments of nourishment servedonly to whet my hunger.  At first I was surprised at this flood in ahot, dry summer, but afterwards I discovered that it was caused by thetropical exuberance of the red weed.  Directly this extraordinarygrowth encountered water it straightway became gigantic and ofunparalleled fecundity.  Its seeds were simply poured down into thewater of the Wey and Thames, and its swiftly growing and Titanic waterfronds speedily choked both those rivers.At Putney, as I afterwards saw, the bridge was almost lost in atangle of this weed, and at Richmond, too, the Thames water poured ina broad and shallow stream across the meadows of Hampton andTwickenham.  As the water spread the weed followed them, until theruined villas of the Thames valley were for a time lost in this redswamp, whose margin I explored, and much of the desolation theMartians had caused was concealed.In the end the red weed succumbed almost as quickly as it hadspread.  A cankering disease, due, it is believed, to the action ofcertain bacteria, presently seized upon it.  Now by the action ofnatural selection, all terrestrial plants have acquired a resistingpower against bacterial diseases--they never succumb without a severestruggle, but the red weed rotted like a thing already dead.  Thefronds became bleached, and then shrivelled and brittle.  They brokeoff at the least touch, and the waters that had stimulated their earlygrowth carried their last vestiges out to sea.My first act on coming to this water was, of course, to slake mythirst.  I drank a great deal of it and, moved by an impulse, gnawedsome fronds of red weed; but they were watery, and had a sickly,metallic taste.  I found the water was sufficiently shallow for me towade securely, although the red weed impeded my feet a little; but theflood evidently got deeper towards the river, and I turned back toMortlake.  I managed to make out the road by means of occasional ruinsof its villas and fences and lamps, and so presently I got out of thisspate and made my way to the hill going up towards Roehampton and cameout on Putney Common.Here the scenery changed from the strange and unfamiliar to thewreckage of the familiar: patches of ground exhibited the devastationof a cyclone, and in a few score yards I would come upon perfectlyundisturbed spaces, houses with their blinds trimly drawn and doorsclosed, as if they had been left for a day by the owners, or as iftheir inhabitants slept within.  The red weed was less abundant; thetall trees along the lane were free from the red creeper.  I huntedfor food among the trees, finding nothing, and I also raided a coupleof silent houses, but they had already been broken into and ransacked.I rested for the remainder of the daylight in a shrubbery, being, inmy enfeebled condition, too fatigued to push on.All this time I saw no human beings, and no signs of the Martians.I encountered a couple of hungry-looking dogs, but both hurriedcircuitously away from the advances I made them.  Near Roehampton Ihad seen two human skeletons--not bodies, but skeletons, pickedclean--and in the wood by me I found the crushed and scattered bonesof several cats and rabbits and the skull of a sheep.  But though Ignawed parts of these in my mouth, there was nothing to be got fromthem.After sunset I struggled on along the road towards Putney, where Ithink the Heat-Ray must have been used for some reason.  And in thegarden beyond Roehampton I got a quantity of immature potatoes,sufficient to stay my hunger.  From this garden one looked down uponPutney and the river.  The aspect of the place in the dusk wassingularly desolate: blackened trees, blackened, desolate ruins, anddown the hill the sheets of the flooded river, red-tinged with theweed.  And over all--silence.  It filled me with indescribable terrorto think how swiftly that desolating change had come.For a time I believed that mankind had been swept out of existence,and that I stood there alone, the last man left alive.  Hard by thetop of Putney Hill I came upon another skeleton, with the armsdislocated and removed several yards from the rest of the body.  As Iproceeded I became more and more convinced that the extermination ofmankind was, save for such stragglers as myself, already accomplishedin this part of the world.  The Martians, I thought, had gone on andleft the country desolated, seeking food elsewhere.  Perhaps even nowthey were destroying Berlin or Paris, or it might be they had gonenorthward.CHAPTER SEVENTHE MAN ON PUTNEY HILLI spent that night in the inn that stands at the top of PutneyHill, sleeping in a made bed for the first time since my flight toLeatherhead.  I will not tell the needless trouble I had breaking intothat house--afterwards I found the front door was on the latch--norhow I ransacked every room for food, until just on the verge ofdespair, in what seemed to me to be a servant's bedroom, I found arat-gnawed crust and two tins of pineapple.  The place had beenalready searched and emptied.  In the bar I afterwards found somebiscuits and sandwiches that had been overlooked.  The latter I couldnot eat, they were too rotten, but the former not only stayed myhunger, but filled my pockets.  I lit no lamps, fearing some Martianmight come beating that part of London for food in the night.  BeforeI went to bed I had an interval of restlessness, and prowled fromwindow to window, peering out for some sign of these monsters.  Islept little.  As I lay in bed I found myself thinking consecutively--athing I do not remember to have done since my last argument with thecurate.  During all the intervening time my mental condition had beena hurrying succession of vague emotional states or a sort of stupidreceptivity.  But in the night my brain, reinforced, I suppose, by thefood I had eaten, grew clear again, and I thought.Three things struggled for possession of my mind: the killing ofthe curate, the whereabouts of the Martians, and the possible fate ofmy wife.  The former gave me no sensation of horror or remorse torecall; I saw it simply as a thing done, a memory infinitelydisagreeable but quite without the quality of remorse.  I saw myselfthen as I see myself now, driven step by step towards that hasty blow,the creature of a sequence of accidents leading inevitably to that.  Ifelt no condemnation; yet the memory, static, unprogressive, hauntedme.  In the silence of the night, with that sense of the nearness ofGod that sometimes comes into the stillness and the darkness, I stoodmy trial, my only trial, for that moment of wrath and fear.  Iretraced every step of our conversation from the moment when I hadfound him crouching beside me, heedless of my thirst, and pointing tothe fire and smoke that streamed up from the ruins of Weybridge.  Wehad been incapable of co-operation--grim chance had taken no heed ofthat.  Had I foreseen, I should have left him at Halliford.  But I didnot foresee; and crime is to foresee and do.  And I set this down as Ihave set all this story down, as it was.  There were no witnesses--allthese things I might have concealed.  But I set it down, and thereader must form his judgment as he will.And when, by an effort, I had set aside that picture of a prostratebody, I faced the problem of the Martians and the fate of my wife.  Forthe former I had no data; I could imagine a hundred things, and so,unhappily, I could for the latter.  And suddenly that night becameterrible.  I found myself sitting up in bed, staring at the dark.  Ifound myself praying that the Heat-Ray might have suddenly andpainlessly struck her out of being.  Since the night of my return fromLeatherhead I had not prayed.  I had uttered prayers, fetish prayers,had prayed as heathens mutter charms when I was in extremity; but nowI prayed indeed, pleading steadfastly and sanely, face to face withthe darkness of God.  Strange night!  Strangest in this, that so soonas dawn had come, I, who had talked with God, crept out of the houselike a rat leaving its hiding place--a creature scarcely larger, aninferior animal, a thing that for any passing whim of our mastersmight be hunted and killed.  Perhaps they also prayed confidently toGod.  Surely, if we have learned nothing else, this war has taught uspity--pity for those witless souls that suffer our dominion.The morning was bright and fine, and the eastern sky glowed pink,and was fretted with little golden clouds.  In the road that runs fromthe top of Putney Hill to Wimbledon was a number of poor vestiges ofthe panic torrent that must have poured Londonward on the Sunday nightafter the fighting began.  There was a little two-wheeled cartinscribed with the name of Thomas Lobb, Greengrocer, New Malden, witha smashed wheel and an abandoned tin trunk; there was a straw hattrampled into the now hardened mud, and at the top of West Hill a lotof blood-stained glass about the overturned water trough.  Mymovements were languid, my plans of the vaguest.  I had an idea ofgoing to Leatherhead, though I knew that there I had the poorestchance of finding my wife.  Certainly, unless death had overtaken themsuddenly, my cousins and she would have fled thence; but it seemed tome I might find or learn there whither the Surrey people had fled.  Iknew I wanted to find my wife, that my heart ached for her and theworld of men, but I had no clear idea how the finding might be done.  Iwas also sharply aware now of my intense loneliness.  From the cornerI went, under cover of a thicket of trees and bushes, to the edge ofWimbledon Common, stretching wide and far.That dark expanse was lit in patches by yellow gorse and broom;there was no red weed to be seen, and as I prowled, hesitating, on theverge of the open, the sun rose, flooding it all with light andvitality.  I came upon a busy swarm of little frogs in a swampy placeamong the trees.  I stopped to look at them, drawing a lesson fromtheir stout resolve to live.  And presently, turning suddenly, with anodd feeling of being watched, I beheld something crouching amid aclump of bushes.  I stood regarding this.  I made a step towards it,and it rose up and became a man armed with a cutlass.  I approachedhim slowly.  He stood silent and motionless, regarding me.As I drew nearer I perceived he was dressed in clothes as dusty andfilthy as my own; he looked, indeed, as though he had been draggedthrough a culvert.  Nearer, I distinguished the green slime of ditchesmixing with the pale drab of dried clay and shiny, coaly patches.  Hisblack hair fell over his eyes, and his face was dark and dirty andsunken, so that at first I did not recognise him.  There was a red cutacross the lower part of his face.&quot;Stop!&quot; he cried, when I was within ten yards of him, and Istopped.  His voice was hoarse.  &quot;Where do you come from?&quot; he said.I thought, surveying him.&quot;I come from Mortlake,&quot; I said.  &quot;I was buried near the pit theMartians made about their cylinder.  I have worked my way out andescaped.&quot;&quot;There is no food about here,&quot; he said.  &quot;This is my country.  Allthis hill down to the river, and back to Clapham, and up to the edgeof the common.  There is only food for one.  Which way are you going?&quot;I answered slowly.&quot;I don't know,&quot; I said.  &quot;I have been buried in the ruins of ahouse thirteen or fourteen days.  I don't know what has happened.&quot;He looked at me doubtfully, then started, and looked with a changedexpression.&quot;I've no wish to stop about here,&quot; said I.  &quot;I think I shall go toLeatherhead, for my wife was there.&quot;He shot out a pointing finger.&quot;It is you,&quot; said he; &quot;the man from Woking.  And you weren't killedat Weybridge?&quot;I recognised him at the same moment.&quot;You are the artilleryman who came into my garden.&quot;&quot;Good luck!&quot; he said.  &quot;We are lucky ones!  Fancy _you_!&quot;  He put outa hand, and I took it.  &quot;I crawled up a drain,&quot; he said. &quot;But theydidn't kill everyone.  And after they went away I got off towardsWalton across the fields.  But---- It's not sixteen days altogether--andyour hair is grey.&quot;  He looked over his shoulder suddenly.  &quot;Onlya rook,&quot; he said.  &quot;One gets to know that birds have shadows thesedays.  This is a bit open.  Let us crawl under those bushes and talk.&quot;&quot;Have you seen any Martians?&quot; I said.  &quot;Since I crawled out----&quot;&quot;They've gone away across London,&quot; he said.  &quot;I guess they've got abigger camp there.  Of a night, all over there, Hampstead way, the skyis alive with their lights.  It's like a great city, and in the glareyou can just see them moving.  By daylight you can't.  But nearer--Ihaven't seen them--&quot; (he counted on his fingers) &quot;five days.  Then Isaw a couple across Hammersmith way carrying something big.  And thenight before last&quot;--he stopped and spoke impressively--&quot;it was just amatter of lights, but it was something up in the air.  I believethey've built a flying-machine, and are learning to fly.&quot;I stopped, on hands and knees, for we had come to the bushes.&quot;Fly!&quot;&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;fly.&quot;I went on into a little bower, and sat down.&quot;It is all over with humanity,&quot; I said.  &quot;If they can do that theywill simply go round the world.&quot;He nodded.&quot;They will.  But---- It will relieve things over here a bit.  Andbesides----&quot;  He looked at me.  &quot;Aren't you satisfied it _is_ up withhumanity?  I am.  We're down; we're beat.&quot;I stared.  Strange as it may seem, I had not arrived at this fact--afact perfectly obvious so soon as he spoke.  I had still held avague hope; rather, I had kept a lifelong habit of mind.  He repeatedhis words, &quot;We're beat.&quot;  They carried absolute conviction.&quot;It's all over,&quot; he said.  &quot;They've lost _one_--just _one_.  And they'vemade their footing good and crippled the greatest power in the world.They've walked over us.  The death of that one at Weybridge was anaccident.  And these are only pioneers.  They kept on coming.  Thesegreen stars--I've seen none these five or six days, but I've no doubtthey're falling somewhere every night.  Nothing's to be done.  We'reunder! We're beat!&quot;I made him no answer.  I sat staring before me, trying in vain todevise some countervailing thought.&quot;This isn't a war,&quot; said the artilleryman.  &quot;It never was a war,any more than there's war between man and ants.&quot;Suddenly I recalled the night in the observatory.&quot;After the tenth shot they fired no more--at least, until the firstcylinder came.&quot;&quot;How do you know?&quot; said the artilleryman.  I explained.  He thought.&quot;Something wrong with the gun,&quot; he said.  &quot;But what if there is?They'll get it right again.  And even if there's a delay, how can italter the end?  It's just men and ants.  There's the ants builds theircities, live their lives, have wars, revolutions, until the men wantthem out of the way, and then they go out of the way.  That's what weare now--just ants.  Only----&quot;&quot;Yes,&quot; I said.&quot;We're eatable ants.&quot;We sat looking at each other.&quot;And what will they do with us?&quot; I said.&quot;That's what I've been thinking,&quot; he said; &quot;that's what I've beenthinking.  After Weybridge I went south--thinking.  I saw what was up.Most of the people were hard at it squealing and exciting themselves.But I'm not so fond of squealing.  I've been in sight of death once ortwice; I'm not an ornamental soldier, and at the best and worst,death--it's just death.  And it's the man that keeps on thinking comesthrough.  I saw everyone tracking away south.  Says I, 'Food won'tlast this way,' and I turned right back.  I went for the Martians likea sparrow goes for man.  All round&quot;--he waved a hand to thehorizon--&quot;they're starving in heaps, bolting, treading on each other.. . .&quot;He saw my face, and halted awkwardly.&quot;No doubt lots who had money have gone away to France,&quot; he said.  Heseemed to hesitate whether to apologise, met my eyes, and went on:&quot;There's food all about here.  Canned things in shops; wines, spirits,mineral waters; and the water mains and drains are empty.  Well, I wastelling you what I was thinking.  'Here's intelligent things,' I said,'and it seems they want us for food.  First, they'll smash us up--ships,machines, guns, cities, all the order and organisation.  Allthat will go.  If we were the size of ants we might pull through.  Butwe're not.  It's all too bulky to stop.  That's the first certainty.'Eh?&quot;I assented.&quot;It is; I've thought it out.  Very well, then--next; at presentwe're caught as we're wanted.  A Martian has only to go a few miles toget a crowd on the run.  And I saw one, one day, out by Wandsworth,picking houses to pieces and routing among the wreckage.  But theywon't keep on doing that.  So soon as they've settled all our guns andships, and smashed our railways, and done all the things they aredoing over there, they will begin catching us systematic, picking thebest and storing us in cages and things.  That's what they will startdoing in a bit.  Lord!  They haven't begun on us yet.  Don't you seethat?&quot;&quot;Not begun!&quot; I exclaimed.&quot;Not begun.  All that's happened so far is through our not havingthe sense to keep quiet--worrying them with guns and such foolery.  Andlosing our heads, and rushing off in crowds to where there wasn't anymore safety than where we were.  They don't want to bother us yet.They're making their things--making all the things they couldn't bringwith them, getting things ready for the rest of their people.  Verylikely that's why the cylinders have stopped for a bit, for fear ofhitting those who are here.  And instead of our rushing about blind,on the howl, or getting dynamite on the chance of busting them up,we've got to fix ourselves up according to the new state of affairs.That's how I figure it out.  It isn't quite according to what a manwants for his species, but it's about what the facts point to.  Andthat's the principle I acted upon.  Cities, nations, civilisation,progress--it's all over.  That game's up.  We're beat.&quot;&quot;But if that is so, what is there to live for?&quot;The artilleryman looked at me for a moment.&quot;There won't be any more blessed concerts for a million years orso; there won't be any Royal Academy of Arts, and no nice little feedsat restaurants.  If it's amusement you're after, I reckon the game isup.  If you've got any drawing-room manners or a dislike to eatingpeas with a knife or dropping aitches, you'd better chuck 'em away.They ain't no further use.&quot;&quot;You mean----&quot;&quot;I mean that men like me are going on living--for the sake of thebreed.  I tell you, I'm grim set on living.  And if I'm not mistaken,you'll show what insides _you've_ got, too, before long.  We aren'tgoing to be exterminated.  And I don't mean to be caught either, andtamed and fattened and bred like a thundering ox.  Ugh! Fancy thosebrown creepers!&quot;&quot;You don't mean to say----&quot;&quot;I do.  I'm going on, under their feet.  I've got it planned; I'vethought it out.  We men are beat.  We don't know enough.  We've got tolearn before we've got a chance.  And we've got to live and keepindependent while we learn.  See! That's what has to be done.&quot;I stared, astonished, and stirred profoundly by the man'sresolution.&quot;Great God!&quot; cried I.  &quot;But you are a man indeed!&quot;  And suddenly Igripped his hand.&quot;Eh!&quot; he said, with his eyes shining.  &quot;I've thought it out, eh?&quot;&quot;Go on,&quot; I said.&quot;Well, those who mean to escape their catching must get ready.  I'mgetting ready.  Mind you, it isn't all of us that are made for wildbeasts; and that's what it's got to be.  That's why I watched you.  Ihad my doubts.  You're slender.  I didn't know that it was you, yousee, or just how you'd been buried.  All these--the sort of peoplethat lived in these houses, and all those damn little clerks that usedto live down that way--they'd be no good.  They haven't any spirit inthem--no proud dreams and no proud lusts; and a man who hasn't one orthe other--Lord!  What is he but funk and precautions?  They just usedto skedaddle off to work--I've seen hundreds of 'em, bit of breakfastin hand, running wild and shining to catch their little season-tickettrain, for fear they'd get dismissed if they didn't; working atbusinesses they were afraid to take the trouble to understand;skedaddling back for fear they wouldn't be in time for dinner; keepingindoors after dinner for fear of the back streets, and sleeping withthe wives they married, not because they wanted them, but because theyhad a bit of money that would make for safety in their one littlemiserable skedaddle through the world.  Lives insured and a bitinvested for fear of accidents.  And on Sundays--fear of thehereafter.  As if hell was built for rabbits!  Well, the Martians willjust be a godsend to these.  Nice roomy cages, fattening food, carefulbreeding, no worry.  After a week or so chasing about the fields andlands on empty stomachs, they'll come and be caught cheerful.  They'llbe quite glad after a bit.  They'll wonder what people did beforethere were Martians to take care of them.  And the bar loafers, andmashers, and singers--I can imagine them.  I can imagine them,&quot; hesaid, with a sort of sombre gratification.  &quot;There'll be any amount ofsentiment and religion loose among them.  There's hundreds of things Isaw with my eyes that I've only begun to see clearly these last fewdays.  There's lots will take things as they are--fat and stupid; andlots will be worried by a sort of feeling that it's all wrong, andthat they ought to be doing something.  Now whenever things are sothat a lot of people feel they ought to be doing something, the weak,and those who go weak with a lot of complicated thinking, always makefor a sort of do-nothing religion, very pious and superior, andsubmit to persecution and the will of the Lord.  Very likely you'veseen the same thing.  It's energy in a gale of funk, and turned cleaninside out.  These cages will be full of psalms and hymns and piety.And those of a less simple sort will work in a bit of--what isit?--eroticism.&quot;He paused.&quot;Very likely these Martians will make pets of some of them; trainthem to do tricks--who knows?--get sentimental over the pet boy whogrew up and had to be killed.  And some, maybe, they will train tohunt us.&quot;&quot;No,&quot; I cried, &quot;that's impossible!  No human being----&quot;&quot;What's the good of going on with such lies?&quot; said theartilleryman.  &quot;There's men who'd do it cheerful.  What nonsense topretend there isn't!&quot;And I succumbed to his conviction.&quot;If they come after me,&quot; he said; &quot;Lord, if they come after me!&quot;and subsided into a grim meditation.I sat contemplating these things.  I could find nothing to bringagainst this man's reasoning.  In the days before the invasion no onewould have questioned my intellectual superiority to his--I, aprofessed and recognised writer on philosophical themes, and he, acommon soldier; and yet he had already formulated a situation that Ihad scarcely realised.&quot;What are you doing?&quot; I said presently.  &quot;What plans have youmade?&quot;He hesitated.&quot;Well, it's like this,&quot; he said.  &quot;What have we to do?  We have toinvent a sort of life where men can live and breed, and besufficiently secure to bring the children up.  Yes--wait a bit, andI'll make it clearer what I think ought to be done.  The tame oneswill go like all tame beasts; in a few generations they'll be big,beautiful, rich-blooded, stupid--rubbish! The risk is that we who keepwild will go savage--degenerate into a sort of big, savage rat. . . .You see, how I mean to live is underground.  I've been thinking aboutthe drains.  Of course those who don't know drains think horriblethings; but under this London are miles and miles--hundreds ofmiles--and a few days rain and London empty will leave them sweet andclean. The main drains are big enough and airy enough for anyone.Then there's cellars, vaults, stores, from which bolting passages maybe made to the drains. And the railway tunnels and subways.  Eh?  Youbegin to see?  And we form a band--able-bodied, clean-minded men.We're not going to pick up any rubbish that drifts in.  Weaklingsgo out again.&quot;&quot;As you meant me to go?&quot;&quot;Well--I parleyed, didn't I?&quot;&quot;We won't quarrel about that.  Go on.&quot;&quot;Those who stop obey orders.  Able-bodied, clean-minded women wewant also--mothers and teachers.  No lackadaisical ladies--no blastedrolling eyes.  We can't have any weak or silly.  Life is real again,and the useless and cumbersome and mischievous have to die.  Theyought to die.  They ought to be willing to die.  It's a sort ofdisloyalty, after all, to live and taint the race.  And they can't behappy.  Moreover, dying's none so dreadful; it's the funking makes itbad.  And in all those places we shall gather.  Our district will beLondon.  And we may even be able to keep a watch, and run about in theopen when the Martians keep away.  Play cricket, perhaps.  That's howwe shall save the race.  Eh?  It's a possible thing?  But saving therace is nothing in itself.  As I say, that's only being rats.  It'ssaving our knowledge and adding to it is the thing.  There men likeyou come in.  There's books, there's models.  We must make great safeplaces down deep, and get all the books we can; not novels and poetryswipes, but ideas, science books.  That's where men like you come in.We must go to the British Museum and pick all those books through.Especially we must keep up our science--learn more.  We must watchthese Martians.  Some of us must go as spies.  When it's all working,perhaps I will.  Get caught, I mean.  And the great thing is, we mustleave the Martians alone.  We mustn't even steal.  If we get in theirway, we clear out.  We must show them we mean no harm.  Yes, I know.But they're intelligent things, and they won't hunt us down if theyhave all they want, and think we're just harmless vermin.&quot;The artilleryman paused and laid a brown hand upon my arm.&quot;After all, it may not be so much we may have to learn before--Justimagine this: four or five of their fighting machines suddenlystarting off--Heat-Rays right and left, and not a Martian in 'em.  Nota Martian in 'em, but men--men who have learned the way how.  It maybe in my time, even--those men.  Fancy having one of them lovelythings, with its Heat-Ray wide and free!  Fancy having it in control!What would it matter if you smashed to smithereens at the end of therun, after a bust like that?  I reckon the Martians'll open theirbeautiful eyes!  Can't you see them, man?  Can't you see themhurrying, hurrying--puffing and blowing and hooting to their othermechanical affairs?  Something out of gear in every case.  And swish,bang, rattle, swish!  Just as they are fumbling over it, _swish_ comesthe Heat-Ray, and, behold! man has come back to his own.&quot;For a while the imaginative daring of the artilleryman, and thetone of assurance and courage he assumed, completely dominated mymind.  I believed unhesitatingly both in his forecast of human destinyand in the practicability of his astonishing scheme, and the readerwho thinks me susceptible and foolish must contrast his position,reading steadily with all his thoughts about his subject, and mine,crouching fearfully in the bushes and listening, distracted byapprehension.  We talked in this manner through the early morningtime, and later crept out of the bushes, and, after scanning the skyfor Martians, hurried precipitately to the house on Putney Hill wherehe had made his lair.  It was the coal cellar of the place, and when Isaw the work he had spent a week upon--it was a burrow scarcely tenyards long, which he designed to reach to the main drain on PutneyHill--I had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and hispowers.  Such a hole I could have dug in a day.  But I believed in himsufficiently to work with him all that morning until past midday athis digging.  We had a garden barrow and shot the earth we removedagainst the kitchen range.  We refreshed ourselves with a tin ofmock-turtle soup and wine from the neighbouring pantry.  I found acurious relief from the aching strangeness of the world in this steadylabour. As we worked, I turned his project over in my mind, andpresently objections and doubts began to arise; but I worked there allthe morning, so glad was I to find myself with a purpose again.  Afterworking an hour I began to speculate on the distance one had to gobefore the cloaca was reached, the chances we had of missing italtogether.  My immediate trouble was why we should dig this longtunnel, when it was possible to get into the drain at once down one ofthe manholes, and work back to the house.  It seemed to me, too, thatthe house was inconveniently chosen, and required a needless length oftunnel.  And just as I was beginning to face these things, theartilleryman stopped digging, and looked at me.&quot;We're working well,&quot; he said.  He put down his spade. &quot;Let usknock off a bit&quot; he said.  &quot;I think it's time we reconnoitred from theroof of the house.&quot;I was for going on, and after a little hesitation he resumed hisspade; and then suddenly I was struck by a thought.  I stopped, and sodid he at once.&quot;Why were you walking about the common,&quot; I said, &quot;instead of beinghere?&quot;&quot;Taking the air,&quot; he said.  &quot;I was coming back.  It's safer bynight.&quot;&quot;But the work?&quot;&quot;Oh, one can't always work,&quot; he said, and in a flash I saw the manplain.  He hesitated, holding his spade.  &quot;We ought to reconnoitrenow,&quot; he said, &quot;because if any come near they may hear the spades anddrop upon us unawares.&quot;I was no longer disposed to object.  We went together to the roofand stood on a ladder peeping out of the roof door.  No Martians wereto be seen, and we ventured out on the tiles, and slipped down undershelter of the parapet.From this position a shrubbery hid the greater portion of Putney,but we could see the river below, a bubbly mass of red weed, and thelow parts of Lambeth flooded and red.  The red creeper swarmed up thetrees about the old palace, and their branches stretched gaunt anddead, and set with shrivelled leaves, from amid its clusters.  It wasstrange how entirely dependent both these things were upon flowingwater for their propagation.  About us neither had gained a footing;laburnums, pink mays, snowballs, and trees of arbor-vitae, rose out oflaurels and hydrangeas, green and brilliant into the sunlight.  BeyondKensington dense smoke was rising, and that and a blue haze hid thenorthward hills.The artilleryman began to tell me of the sort of people who stillremained in London.&quot;One night last week,&quot; he said, &quot;some fools got the electric lightin order, and there was all Regent Street and the Circus ablaze,crowded with painted and ragged drunkards, men and women, dancing andshouting till dawn.  A man who was there told me.  And as the day camethey became aware of a fighting-machine standing near by the Langhamand looking down at them.  Heaven knows how long he had been there.It must have given some of them a nasty turn.  He came down the roadtowards them, and picked up nearly a hundred too drunk or frightenedto run away.&quot;Grotesque gleam of a time no history will ever fully describe!From that, in answer to my questions, he came round to hisgrandiose plans again.  He grew enthusiastic.  He talked so eloquentlyof the possibility of capturing a fighting-machine that I more thanhalf believed in him again.  But now that I was beginning tounderstand something of his quality, I could divine the stress he laidon doing nothing precipitately.  And I noted that now there was noquestion that he personally was to capture and fight the greatmachine.After a time we went down to the cellar.  Neither of us seemeddisposed to resume digging, and when he suggested a meal, I wasnothing loath.  He became suddenly very generous, and when we hadeaten he went away and returned with some excellent cigars.  We litthese, and his optimism glowed.  He was inclined to regard my comingas a great occasion.&quot;There's some champagne in the cellar,&quot; he said.&quot;We can dig better on this Thames-side burgundy,&quot; said I.&quot;No,&quot; said he; &quot;I am host today.  Champagne!  Great God! We've aheavy enough task before us!  Let us take a rest and gather strengthwhile we may.  Look at these blistered hands!&quot;And pursuant to this idea of a holiday, he insisted upon playingcards after we had eaten.  He taught me euchre, and after dividingLondon between us, I taking the northern side and he the southern, weplayed for parish points.  Grotesque and foolish as this will seem tothe sober reader, it is absolutely true, and what is more remarkable,I found the card game and several others we played extremelyinteresting.Strange mind of man! that, with our species upon the edge ofextermination or appalling degradation, with no clear prospect beforeus but the chance of a horrible death, we could sit following thechance of this painted pasteboard, and playing the &quot;joker&quot; with vividdelight.  Afterwards he taught me poker, and I beat him at three toughchess games.  When dark came we decided to take the risk, and lit alamp.After an interminable string of games, we supped, and theartilleryman finished the champagne.  We went on smoking the cigars.He was no longer the energetic regenerator of his species I hadencountered in the morning.  He was still optimistic, but it was aless kinetic, a more thoughtful optimism.  I remember he wound up withmy health, proposed in a speech of small variety and considerableintermittence.  I took a cigar, and went upstairs to look at thelights of which he had spoken that blazed so greenly along theHighgate hills.At first I stared unintelligently across the London valley.  Thenorthern hills were shrouded in darkness; the fires near Kensingtonglowed redly, and now and then an orange-red tongue of flame flashedup and vanished in the deep blue night.  All the rest of Londonwas black.  Then, nearer, I perceived a strange light, a pale,violet-purple fluorescent glow, quivering under the night breeze.  Fora space I could not understand it, and then I knew that it must bethe red weed from which this faint irradiation proceeded.  With thatrealisation my dormant sense of wonder, my sense of the proportion ofthings, awoke again.  I glanced from that to Mars, red and clear,glowing high in the west, and then gazed long and earnestly at thedarkness of Hampstead and Highgate.I remained a very long time upon the roof, wondering at thegrotesque changes of the day.  I recalled my mental states from themidnight prayer to the foolish card-playing.  I had a violentrevulsion of feeling.  I remember I flung away the cigar with acertain wasteful symbolism.  My folly came to me with glaringexaggeration.  I seemed a traitor to my wife and to my kind; I wasfilled with remorse.  I resolved to leave this strange undisciplineddreamer of great things to his drink and gluttony, and to go on intoLondon.  There, it seemed to me, I had the best chance of learningwhat the Martians and my fellowmen were doing.  I was still upon theroof when the late moon rose.CHAPTER EIGHTDEAD LONDONAfter I had parted from the artilleryman, I went down the hill, andby the High Street across the bridge to Fulham.  The red weed wastumultuous at that time, and nearly choked the bridge roadway; but itsfronds were already whitened in patches by the spreading disease thatpresently removed it so swiftly.At the corner of the lane that runs to Putney Bridge station Ifound a man lying.  He was as black as a sweep with the black dust,alive, but helplessly and speechlessly drunk.  I could get nothingfrom him but curses and furious lunges at my head.  I think I shouldhave stayed by him but for the brutal expression of his face.There was black dust along the roadway from the bridge onwards, andit grew thicker in Fulham.  The streets were horribly quiet.  I gotfood--sour, hard, and mouldy, but quite eatable--in a baker's shophere.  Some way towards Walham Green the streets became clear ofpowder, and I passed a white terrace of houses on fire; the noise ofthe burning was an absolute relief.  Going on towards Brompton, thestreets were quiet again.Here I came once more upon the black powder in the streets and upondead bodies.  I saw altogether about a dozen in the length of theFulham Road.  They had been dead many days, so that I hurried quicklypast them.  The black powder covered them over, and softened theiroutlines.  One or two had been disturbed by dogs.Where there was no black powder, it was curiously like a Sunday inthe City, with the closed shops, the houses locked up and the blindsdrawn, the desertion, and the stillness.  In some places plunderershad been at work, but rarely at other than the provision and wineshops.  A jeweller's window had been broken open in one place, butapparently the thief had been disturbed, and a number of gold chainsand a watch lay scattered on the pavement.  I did not trouble to touchthem.  Farther on was a tattered woman in a heap on a doorstep; thehand that hung over her knee was gashed and bled down her rusty browndress, and a smashed magnum of champagne formed a pool across thepavement.  She seemed asleep, but she was dead.The farther I penetrated into London, the profounder grew thestillness.  But it was not so much the stillness of death--it was thestillness of suspense, of expectation.  At any time the destructionthat had already singed the northwestern borders of the metropolis,and had annihilated Ealing and Kilburn, might strike among thesehouses and leave them smoking ruins.  It was a city condemned andderelict. . . .In South Kensington the streets were clear of dead and of blackpowder.  It was near South Kensington that I first heard the howling.It crept almost imperceptibly upon my senses.  It was a sobbingalternation of two notes, &quot;Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,&quot; keeping onperpetually.  When I passed streets that ran northward it grew involume, and houses and buildings seemed to deaden and cut it offagain.  It came in a full tide down Exhibition Road.  I stopped,staring towards Kensington Gardens, wondering at this strange, remotewailing.  It was as if that mighty desert of houses had found a voicefor its fear and solitude.&quot;Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,&quot; wailed that superhuman note--great wavesof sound sweeping down the broad, sunlit roadway, between the tallbuildings on each side.  I turned northwards, marvelling, towards theiron gates of Hyde Park.  I had half a mind to break into the NaturalHistory Museum and find my way up to the summits of the towers, inorder to see across the park.  But I decided to keep to the ground,where quick hiding was possible, and so went on up the ExhibitionRoad.  All the large mansions on each side of the road were empty andstill, and my footsteps echoed against the sides of the houses.  Atthe top, near the park gate, I came upon a strange sight--a busoverturned, and the skeleton of a horse picked clean.  I puzzled overthis for a time, and then went on to the bridge over the Serpentine.The voice grew stronger and stronger, though I could see nothing abovethe housetops on the north side of the park, save a haze of smoke tothe northwest.&quot;Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,&quot; cried the voice, coming, as it seemed tome, from the district about Regent's Park.  The desolating cry workedupon my mind.  The mood that had sustained me passed.  The wailingtook possession of me.  I found I was intensely weary, footsore, andnow again hungry and thirsty.It was already past noon.  Why was I wandering alone in this cityof the dead?  Why was I alone when all London was lying in state, andin its black shroud?  I felt intolerably lonely.  My mind ran on oldfriends that I had forgotten for years.  I thought of the poisons inthe chemists' shops, of the liquors the wine merchants stored; Irecalled the two sodden creatures of despair, who so far as I knew,shared the city with myself. . . .I came into Oxford Street by the Marble Arch, and here again wereblack powder and several bodies, and an evil, ominous smell from thegratings of the cellars of some of the houses.  I grew very thirstyafter the heat of my long walk.  With infinite trouble I managed tobreak into a public-house and get food and drink.  I was weary aftereating, and went into the parlour behind the bar, and slept on a blackhorsehair sofa I found there.I awoke to find that dismal howling still in my ears, &quot;Ulla, ulla,ulla, ulla.&quot;  It was now dusk, and after I had routed out somebiscuits and a cheese in the bar--there was a meat safe, but itcontained nothing but maggots--I wandered on through the silentresidential squares to Baker Street--Portman Square is the only one Ican name--and so came out at last upon Regent's Park.  And as Iemerged from the top of Baker Street, I saw far away over the trees inthe clearness of the sunset the hood of the Martian giant from whichthis howling proceeded.  I was not terrified.  I came upon him as ifit were a matter of course.  I watched him for some time, but he didnot move.  He appeared to be standing and yelling, for no reason thatI could discover.I tried to formulate a plan of action.  That perpetual sound of&quot;Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,&quot; confused my mind.  Perhaps I was too tiredto be very fearful.  Certainly I was more curious to know the reasonof this monotonous crying than afraid.  I turned back away from thepark and struck into Park Road, intending to skirt the park, wentalong under the shelter of the terraces, and got a view of thisstationary, howling Martian from the direction of St. John's Wood.  Acouple of hundred yards out of Baker Street I heard a yelping chorus,and saw, first a dog with a piece of putrescent red meat in his jawscoming headlong towards me, and then a pack of starving mongrels inpursuit of him.  He made a wide curve to avoid me, as though he fearedI might prove a fresh competitor.  As the yelping died away down thesilent road, the wailing sound of &quot;Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,&quot; reasserteditself.I came upon the wrecked handling-machine halfway to St. John's Woodstation.  At first I thought a house had fallen across the road.  Itwas only as I clambered among the ruins that I saw, with a start, thismechanical Samson lying, with its tentacles bent and smashed andtwisted, among the ruins it had made.  The forepart was shattered.  Itseemed as if it had driven blindly straight at the house, and had beenoverwhelmed in its overthrow.  It seemed to me then that this mighthave happened by a handling-machine escaping from the guidance of itsMartian.  I could not clamber among the ruins to see it, and thetwilight was now so far advanced that the blood with which its seatwas smeared, and the gnawed gristle of the Martian that the dogs hadleft, were invisible to me.Wondering still more at all that I had seen, I pushed on towardsPrimrose Hill.  Far away, through a gap in the trees, I saw a secondMartian, as motionless as the first, standing in the park towards theZoological Gardens, and silent.  A little beyond the ruins about thesmashed handling-machine I came upon the red weed again, and found theRegent's Canal, a spongy mass of dark-red vegetation.As I crossed the bridge, the sound of &quot;Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,&quot;ceased.  It was, as it were, cut off.  The silence came like athunderclap.The dusky houses about me stood faint and tall and dim; the treestowards the park were growing black.  All about me the red weedclambered among the ruins, writhing to get above me in the dimness.Night, the mother of fear and mystery, was coming upon me.  But whilethat voice sounded the solitude, the desolation, had been endurable;by virtue of it London had still seemed alive, and the sense of lifeabout me had upheld me.  Then suddenly a change, the passing ofsomething--I knew not what--and then a stillness that could be felt.Nothing but this gaunt quiet.London about me gazed at me spectrally.  The windows in the whitehouses were like the eye sockets of skulls.  About me my imaginationfound a thousand noiseless enemies moving.  Terror seized me, a horrorof my temerity.  In front of me the road became pitchy black as thoughit was tarred, and I saw a contorted shape lying across the pathway.  Icould not bring myself to go on.  I turned down St. John's Wood Road,and ran headlong from this unendurable stillness towards Kilburn.  Ihid from the night and the silence, until long after midnight, in acabmen's shelter in Harrow Road.  But before the dawn my couragereturned, and while the stars were still in the sky I turned once moretowards Regent's Park.  I missed my way among the streets, andpresently saw down a long avenue, in the half-light of the early dawn,the curve of Primrose Hill.  On the summit, towering up to the fadingstars, was a third Martian, erect and motionless like the others.An insane resolve possessed me.  I would die and end it.  And Iwould save myself even the trouble of killing myself.  I marched onrecklessly towards this Titan, and then, as I drew nearer and thelight grew, I saw that a multitude of black birds was circling andclustering about the hood.  At that my heart gave a bound, and I beganrunning along the road.I hurried through the red weed that choked St. Edmund's Terrace (Iwaded breast-high across a torrent of water that was rushing down fromthe waterworks towards the Albert Road), and emerged upon the grassbefore the rising of the sun.  Great mounds had been heaped about thecrest of the hill, making a huge redoubt of it--it was the final andlargest place the Martians had made--and from behind these heaps thererose a thin smoke against the sky.  Against the sky line an eager dogran and disappeared.  The thought that had flashed into my mind grewreal, grew credible.  I felt no fear, only a wild, tremblingexultation, as I ran up the hill towards the motionless monster.  Outof the hood hung lank shreds of brown, at which the hungry birdspecked and tore.In another moment I had scrambled up the earthen rampart and stoodupon its crest, and the interior of the redoubt was below me.  Amighty space it was, with gigantic machines here and there within it,huge mounds of material and strange shelter places.  And scatteredabout it, some in their overturned war-machines, some in the now rigidhandling-machines, and a dozen of them stark and silent and laid in arow, were the Martians--_dead_!--slain by the putrefactive and diseasebacteria against which their systems were unprepared; slain as the redweed was being slain; slain, after all man's devices had failed, bythe humblest things that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this earth.For so it had come about, as indeed I and many men might haveforeseen had not terror and disaster blinded our minds.  Thesegerms of disease have taken toll of humanity since the beginning ofthings--taken toll of our prehuman ancestors since life began here.But by virtue of this natural selection of our kind we have developedresisting power; to no germs do we succumb without a struggle, and tomany--those that cause putrefaction in dead matter, for instance--ourliving frames are altogether immune.  But there are no bacteria inMars, and directly these invaders arrived, directly they drank andfed, our microscopic allies began to work their overthrow.  Alreadywhen I watched them they were irrevocably doomed, dying and rottingeven as they went to and fro.  It was inevitable.  By the toll of abillion deaths man has bought his birthright of the earth, and it ishis against all comers; it would still be his were the Martians tentimes as mighty as they are.  For neither do men live nor die in vain.Here and there they were scattered, nearly fifty altogether, inthat great gulf they had made, overtaken by a death that must haveseemed to them as incomprehensible as any death could be.  To me alsoat that time this death was incomprehensible.  All I knew was thatthese things that had been alive and so terrible to men were dead.For a moment I believed that the destruction of Sennacherib had beenrepeated, that God had repented, that the Angel of Death had slainthem in the night.I stood staring into the pit, and my heart lightened gloriously,even as the rising sun struck the world to fire about me with hisrays.  The pit was still in darkness; the mighty engines, so great andwonderful in their power and complexity, so unearthly in theirtortuous forms, rose weird and vague and strange out of the shadowstowards the light.  A multitude of dogs, I could hear, fought over thebodies that lay darkly in the depth of the pit, far below me.  Acrossthe pit on its farther lip, flat and vast and strange, lay the greatflying-machine with which they had been experimenting upon our denseratmosphere when decay and death arrested them.  Death had come not aday too soon.  At the sound of a cawing overhead I looked up at thehuge fighting-machine that would fight no more for ever, at thetattered red shreds of flesh that dripped down upon the overturnedseats on the summit of Primrose Hill.I turned and looked down the slope of the hill to where, enhaloednow in birds, stood those other two Martians that I had seenovernight, just as death had overtaken them.  The one had died, evenas it had been crying to its companions; perhaps it was the last todie, and its voice had gone on perpetually until the force of itsmachinery was exhausted.  They glittered now, harmless tripod towersof shining metal, in the brightness of the rising sun.All about the pit, and saved as by a miracle from everlastingdestruction, stretched the great Mother of Cities.  Those who have onlyseen London veiled in her sombre robes of smoke can scarcely imaginethe naked clearness and beauty of the silent wilderness of houses.Eastward, over the blackened ruins of the Albert Terrace and thesplintered spire of the church, the sun blazed dazzling in a clearsky, and here and there some facet in the great wilderness of roofscaught the light and glared with a white intensity.Northward were Kilburn and Hampsted, blue and crowded with houses;westward the great city was dimmed; and southward, beyond theMartians, the green waves of Regent's Park, the Langham Hotel, thedome of the Albert Hall, the Imperial Institute, and the giantmansions of the Brompton Road came out clear and little in thesunrise, the jagged ruins of Westminster rising hazily beyond.  Faraway and blue were the Surrey hills, and the towers of the CrystalPalace glittered like two silver rods.  The dome of St. Paul's wasdark against the sunrise, and injured, I saw for the first time, by ahuge gaping cavity on its western side.And as I looked at this wide expanse of houses and factories andchurches, silent and abandoned; as I thought of the multitudinoushopes and efforts, the innumerable hosts of lives that had gone tobuild this human reef, and of the swift and ruthless destruction thathad hung over it all; when I realised that the shadow had been rolledback, and that men might still live in the streets, and this dear vastdead city of mine be once more alive and powerful, I felt a wave ofemotion that was near akin to tears.The torment was over.  Even that day the healing would begin.  Thesurvivors of the people scattered over the country--leaderless,lawless, foodless, like sheep without a shepherd--the thousands whohad fled by sea, would begin to return; the pulse of life, growingstronger and stronger, would beat again in the empty streets and pouracross the vacant squares.  Whatever destruction was done, the hand ofthe destroyer was stayed.  All the gaunt wrecks, the blackenedskeletons of houses that stared so dismally at the sunlit grass of thehill, would presently be echoing with the hammers of the restorers andringing with the tapping of their trowels.  At the thought I extendedmy hands towards the sky and began thanking God.  In a year, thoughtI--in a year. . .With overwhelming force came the thought of myself, of my wife, andthe old life of hope and tender helpfulness that had ceased for ever.CHAPTER NINEWRECKAGEAnd now comes the strangest thing in my story.  Yet, perhaps, it isnot altogether strange.  I remember, clearly and coldly and vividly,all that I did that day until the time that I stood weeping andpraising God upon the summit of Primrose Hill.  And then I forget.Of the next three days I know nothing.  I have learned since that,so far from my being the first discoverer of the Martian overthrow,several such wanderers as myself had already discovered this on theprevious night.  One man--the first--had gone to St. Martin's-le-Grand,and, while I sheltered in the cabmen's hut, had contrived totelegraph to Paris.  Thence the joyful news had flashed all over theworld; a thousand cities, chilled by ghastly apprehensions, suddenlyflashed into frantic illuminations; they knew of it in Dublin,Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham, at the time when I stood upon theverge of the pit.  Already men, weeping with joy, as I have heard,shouting and staying their work to shake hands and shout, were makingup trains, even as near as Crewe, to descend upon London.  The churchbells that had ceased a fortnight since suddenly caught the news,until all England was bell-ringing.  Men on cycles, lean-faced,unkempt, scorched along every country lane shouting of unhopeddeliverance, shouting to gaunt, staring figures of despair.  And forthe food!  Across the Channel, across the Irish Sea, across theAtlantic, corn, bread, and meat were tearing to our relief.  All theshipping in the world seemed going Londonward in those days.  But ofall this I have no memory.  I drifted--a demented man.  I found myselfin a house of kindly people, who had found me on the third daywandering, weeping, and raving through the streets of St. John's Wood.They have told me since that I was singing some insane doggerel about&quot;The Last Man Left Alive! Hurrah!  The Last Man Left Alive!&quot;  Troubledas they were with their own affairs, these people, whose name, much asI would like to express my gratitude to them, I may not even givehere, nevertheless cumbered themselves with me, sheltered me, andprotected me from myself.  Apparently they had learned something of mystory from me during the days of my lapse.Very gently, when my mind was assured again, did they break to mewhat they had learned of the fate of Leatherhead.  Two days after Iwas imprisoned it had been destroyed, with every soul in it, by aMartian.  He had swept it out of existence, as it seemed, without anyprovocation, as a boy might crush an ant hill, in the mere wantonnessof power.I was a lonely man, and they were very kind to me.  I was a lonelyman and a sad one, and they bore with me.  I remained with them fourdays after my recovery.  All that time I felt a vague, a growingcraving to look once more on whatever remained of the little life thatseemed so happy and bright in my past.  It was a mere hopeless desireto feast upon my misery.  They dissuaded me.  They did all they couldto divert me from this morbidity.  But at last I could resist theimpulse no longer, and, promising faithfully to return to them, andparting, as I will confess, from these four-day friends with tears, Iwent out again into the streets that had lately been so dark andstrange and empty.Already they were busy with returning people; in places even therewere shops open, and I saw a drinking fountain running water.I remember how mockingly bright the day seemed as I went back on mymelancholy pilgrimage to the little house at Woking, how busy thestreets and vivid the moving life about me.  So many people wereabroad everywhere, busied in a thousand activities, that it seemedincredible that any great proportion of the population could have beenslain.  But then I noticed how yellow were the skins of the people Imet, how shaggy the hair of the men, how large and bright their eyes,and that every other man still wore his dirty rags.  Their facesseemed all with one of two expressions--a leaping exultation andenergy or a grim resolution.  Save for the expression of the faces,London seemed a city of tramps.  The vestries were indiscriminatelydistributing bread sent us by the French government.  The ribs of thefew horses showed dismally.  Haggard special constables with whitebadges stood at the corners of every street.  I saw little of themischief wrought by the Martians until I reached Wellington Street,and there I saw the red weed clambering over the buttresses ofWaterloo Bridge.At the corner of the bridge, too, I saw one of the common contrastsof that grotesque time--a sheet of paper flaunting against a thicketof the red weed, transfixed by a stick that kept it in place.  It wasthe placard of the first newspaper to resume publication--the _DailyMail_.  I bought a copy for a blackened shilling I found in my pocket.Most of it was in blank, but the solitary compositor who did the thinghad amused himself by making a grotesque scheme of advertisementstereo on the back page.  The matter he printed was emotional; thenews organisation had not as yet found its way back.  I learnednothing fresh except that already in one week the examination of theMartian mechanisms had yielded astonishing results.  Among otherthings, the article assured me what I did not believe at the time,that the &quot;Secret of Flying,&quot; was discovered.  At Waterloo I found thefree trains that were taking people to their homes.  The first rushwas already over.  There were few people in the train, and I was in nomood for casual conversation.  I got a compartment to myself, and satwith folded arms, looking greyly at the sunlit devastation that flowedpast the windows.  And just outside the terminus the train jolted overtemporary rails, and on either side of the railway the houses wereblackened ruins.  To Clapham Junction the face of London was grimywith powder of the Black Smoke, in spite of two days of thunderstormsand rain, and at Clapham Junction the line had been wrecked again;there were hundreds of out-of-work clerks and shopmen working side byside with the customary navvies, and we were jolted over a hastyrelaying.All down the line from there the aspect of the country was gauntand unfamiliar; Wimbledon particularly had suffered.  Walton, by virtueof its unburned pine woods, seemed the least hurt of any place alongthe line.  The Wandle, the Mole, every little stream, was a heapedmass of red weed, in appearance between butcher's meat and pickledcabbage.  The Surrey pine woods were too dry, however, for the festoonsof the red climber.  Beyond Wimbledon, within sight of the line, incertain nursery grounds, were the heaped masses of earth about thesixth cylinder.  A number of people were standing about it, and somesappers were busy in the midst of it.  Over it flaunted a Union Jack,flapping cheerfully in the morning breeze.  The nursery grounds wereeverywhere crimson with the weed, a wide expanse of livid colour cutwith purple shadows, and very painful to the eye.  One's gaze wentwith infinite relief from the scorched greys and sullen reds of theforeground to the blue-green softness of the eastward hills.The line on the London side of Woking station was still undergoingrepair, so I descended at Byfleet station and took the road toMaybury, past the place where I and the artilleryman had talked to thehussars, and on by the spot where the Martian had appeared to me inthe thunderstorm.  Here, moved by curiosity, I turned aside to find,among a tangle of red fronds, the warped and broken dog cart with thewhitened bones of the horse scattered and gnawed.  For a time I stoodregarding these vestiges. . . .Then I returned through the pine wood, neck-high with red weed hereand there, to find the landlord of the Spotted Dog had already foundburial, and so came home past the College Arms.  A man standing at anopen cottage door greeted me by name as I passed.I looked at my house with a quick flash of hope that fadedimmediately.  The door had been forced; it was unfast and was openingslowly as I approached.It slammed again.  The curtains of my study fluttered out of theopen window from which I and the artilleryman had watched the dawn.  Noone had closed it since.  The smashed bushes were just as I had leftthem nearly four weeks ago.  I stumbled into the hall, and the housefelt empty.  The stair carpet was ruffled and discoloured where I hadcrouched, soaked to the skin from the thunderstorm the night of thecatastrophe.  Our muddy footsteps I saw still went up the stairs.I followed them to my study, and found lying on my writing-tablestill, with the selenite paper weight upon it, the sheet of work I hadleft on the afternoon of the opening of the cylinder.  For a space Istood reading over my abandoned arguments.  It was a paper on theprobable development of Moral Ideas with the development of thecivilising process; and the last sentence was the opening of aprophecy: &quot;In about two hundred years,&quot; I had written, &quot;we mayexpect----&quot;  The sentence ended abruptly.  I remembered my inabilityto fix my mind that morning, scarcely a month gone by, and how I hadbroken off to get my _Daily Chronicle_ from the newsboy.  I rememberedhow I went down to the garden gate as he came along, and how I hadlistened to his odd story of &quot;Men from Mars.&quot;I came down and went into the dining room.  There were the muttonand the bread, both far gone now in decay, and a beer bottleoverturned, just as I and the artilleryman had left them.  My home wasdesolate.  I perceived the folly of the faint hope I had cherished solong.  And then a strange thing occurred.  &quot;It is no use,&quot; said avoice.  &quot;The house is deserted.  No one has been here these ten days.Do not stay here to torment yourself.  No one escaped but you.&quot;I was startled.  Had I spoken my thought aloud?  I turned, and theFrench window was open behind me.  I made a step to it, and stoodlooking out.And there, amazed and afraid, even as I stood amazed and afraid,were my cousin and my wife--my wife white and tearless.  She gave afaint cry.&quot;I came,&quot; she said.  &quot;I knew--knew----&quot;She put her hand to her throat--swayed.  I made a step forward, andcaught her in my arms.CHAPTER TENTHE EPILOGUEI cannot but regret, now that I am concluding my story, how littleI am able to contribute to the discussion of the many debatablequestions which are still unsettled.  In one respect I shall certainlyprovoke criticism.  My particular province is speculative philosophy.My knowledge of comparative physiology is confined to a book or two,but it seems to me that Carver's suggestions as to the reason of therapid death of the Martians is so probable as to be regarded almost asa proven conclusion.  I have assumed that in the body of my narrative.At any rate, in all the bodies of the Martians that were examinedafter the war, no bacteria except those already known as terrestrialspecies were found.  That they did not bury any of their dead, and thereckless slaughter they perpetrated, point also to an entire ignoranceof the putrefactive process.  But probable as this seems, it is by nomeans a proven conclusion.Neither is the composition of the Black Smoke known, which theMartians used with such deadly effect, and the generator of theHeat-Rays remains a puzzle.  The terrible disasters at the Ealingand South Kensington laboratories have disinclined analysts for furtherinvestigations upon the latter.  Spectrum analysis of the black powderpoints unmistakably to the presence of an unknown element with abrilliant group of three lines in the green, and it is possible thatit combines with argon to form a compound which acts at once withdeadly effect upon some constituent in the blood.  But such unprovenspeculations will scarcely be of interest to the general reader, towhom this story is addressed.  None of the brown scum that drifteddown the Thames after the destruction of Shepperton was examined atthe time, and now none is forthcoming.The results of an anatomical examination of the Martians, so faras the prowling dogs had left such an examination possible, I havealready given.  But everyone is familiar with the magnificent andalmost complete specimen in spirits at the Natural History Museum, andthe countless drawings that have been made from it; and beyond thatthe interest of their physiology and structure is purely scientific.A question of graver and universal interest is the possibility ofanother attack from the Martians.  I do not think that nearly enoughattention is being given to this aspect of the matter.  At present theplanet Mars is in conjunction, but with every return to opposition I,for one, anticipate a renewal of their adventure.  In any case, weshould be prepared.  It seems to me that it should be possible todefine the position of the gun from which the shots are discharged, tokeep a sustained watch upon this part of the planet, and to anticipatethe arrival of the next attack.In that case the cylinder might be destroyed with dynamite orartillery before it was sufficiently cool for the Martians to emerge,or they might be butchered by means of guns so soon as the screwopened.  It seems to me that they have lost a vast advantage in thefailure of their first surprise.  Possibly they see it in the samelight.Lessing has advanced excellent reasons for supposing that theMartians have actually succeeded in effecting a landing on the planetVenus.  Seven months ago now, Venus and Mars were in alignment withthe sun; that is to say, Mars was in opposition from the point of viewof an observer on Venus.  Subsequently a peculiar luminous and sinuousmarking appeared on the unillumined half of the inner planet, andalmost simultaneously a faint dark mark of a similar sinuous characterwas detected upon a photograph of the Martian disk.  One needs to seethe drawings of these appearances in order to appreciate fully theirremarkable resemblance in character.At any rate, whether we expect another invasion or not, our viewsof the human future must be greatly modified by these events.  We havelearned now that we cannot regard this planet as being fenced in and asecure abiding place for Man; we can never anticipate the unseen goodor evil that may come upon us suddenly out of space.  It may be thatin the larger design of the universe this invasion from Mars is notwithout its ultimate benefit for men; it has robbed us of that sereneconfidence in the future which is the most fruitful source ofdecadence, the gifts to human science it has brought are enormous, andit has done much to promote the conception of the commonweal ofmankind.  It may be that across the immensity of space the Martianshave watched the fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned theirlesson, and that on the planet Venus they have found a securersettlement.  Be that as it may, for many years yet there willcertainly be no relaxation of the eager scrutiny of the Martian disk,and those fiery darts of the sky, the shooting stars, will bring withthem as they fall an unavoidable apprehension to all the sons of men.The broadening of men's views that has resulted can scarcely beexaggerated.  Before the cylinder fell there was a general persuasionthat through all the deep of space no life existed beyond the pettysurface of our minute sphere.  Now we see further.  If the Martianscan reach Venus, there is no reason to suppose that the thing isimpossible for men, and when the slow cooling of the sun makes thisearth uninhabitable, as at last it must do, it may be that the threadof life that has begun here will have streamed out and caught oursister planet within its toils.Dim and wonderful is the vision I have conjured up in my mind oflife spreading slowly from this little seed bed of the solar systemthroughout the inanimate vastness of sidereal space.  But that is aremote dream.  It may be, on the other hand, that the destruction ofthe Martians is only a reprieve.  To them, and not to us, perhaps, isthe future ordained.I must confess the stress and danger of the time have left anabiding sense of doubt and insecurity in my mind.  I sit in my studywriting by lamplight, and suddenly I see again the healing valleybelow set with writhing flames, and feel the house behind and about meempty and desolate.  I go out into the Byfleet Road, and vehicles passme, a butcher boy in a cart, a cabful of visitors, a workman on abicycle, children going to school, and suddenly they become vague andunreal, and I hurry again with the artilleryman through the hot,brooding silence.  Of a night I see the black powder darkening thesilent streets, and the contorted bodies shrouded in that layer; theyrise upon me tattered and dog-bitten.  They gibber and grow fiercer,paler, uglier, mad distortions of humanity at last, and I wake, coldand wretched, in the darkness of the night.I go to London and see the busy multitudes in Fleet Street and theStrand, and it comes across my mind that they are but the ghosts ofthe past, haunting the streets that I have seen silent and wretched,going to and fro, phantasms in a dead city, the mockery of life in agalvanised body.  And strange, too, it is to stand on Primrose Hill,as I did but a day before writing this last chapter, to see the greatprovince of houses, dim and blue through the haze of the smoke andmist, vanishing at last into the vague lower sky, to see the peoplewalking to and fro among the flower beds on the hill, to see thesight-seers about the Martian machine that stands there still, to hearthe tumult of playing children, and to recall the time when I saw itall bright and clear-cut, hard and silent, under the dawn of that lastgreat day. . . .And strangest of all is it to hold my wife's hand again, and to thinkthat I have counted her, and that she has counted me, among the dead.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The War of the Worlds, by H.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tmProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution ofelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computersincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It existsbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations frompeople in all walks of life.Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with theassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm'sgoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection willremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the ProjectGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secureand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundationand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.Section 3.

G. Wells [1898]IThe Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him)was expounding a recondite matter to us. His grey eyes shone andtwinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. Thefire burned brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescentlights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed andpassed in our glasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced andcaressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon, and there was thatluxurious after-dinner atmosphere when thought roams gracefullyfree of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in thisway--marking the points with a lean forefinger--as we sat and lazilyadmired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it)and his fecundity.'You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or twoideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, forinstance, they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.''Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?' said Filby, an argumentative person with red hair.'I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonableground for it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. Youknow of course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness _nil_,has no real existence. They taught you that? Neither has amathematical plane. These things are mere abstractions.''That is all right,' said the Psychologist.'Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have areal existence.''There I object,' said Filby. 'Of course a solid body may exist. Allreal things--''So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an _instantaneous_cube exist?''Don't follow you,' said Filby.'Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a realexistence?'Filby became pensive. 'Clearly,' the Time Traveller proceeded, 'anyreal body must have extension in _four_ directions: it must haveLength, Breadth, Thickness, and--Duration. But through a naturalinfirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, weincline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions,three which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time.There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction betweenthe former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens thatour consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along thelatter from the beginning to the end of our lives.''That,' said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relighthis cigar over the lamp; 'that ... very clear indeed.''Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,'continued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession ofcheerfulness. 'Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension,though some people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not knowthey mean it. It is only another way of looking at Time. _There isno difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Spaceexcept that our consciousness moves along it_. But some foolishpeople have got hold of the wrong side of that idea. You have allheard what they have to say about this Fourth Dimension?''_I_ have not,' said the Provincial Mayor.'It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, isspoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length,Breadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference tothree planes, each at right angles to the others. But somephilosophical people have been asking why _three_ dimensionsparticularly--why not another direction at right angles to the otherthree?--and have even tried to construct a Four-Dimension geometry.Professor Simon Newcomb was expounding this to the New YorkMathematical Society only a month or so ago. You know how on a flatsurface, which has only two dimensions, we can represent a figure ofa three-dimensional solid, and similarly they think that by modelsof three dimensions they could represent one of four--if they couldmaster the perspective of the thing. See?''I think so,' murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting hisbrows, he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as onewho repeats mystic words. 'Yes, I think I see it now,' he said aftersome time, brightening in a quite transitory manner.'Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon thisgeometry of Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my resultsare curious. For instance, here is a portrait of a man at eightyears old, another at fifteen, another at seventeen, another attwenty-three, and so on. All these are evidently sections, as itwere, Three-Dimensional representations of his Four-Dimensionedbeing, which is a fixed and unalterable thing.'Scientific people,' proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pauserequired for the proper assimilation of this, 'know very well thatTime is only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram,a weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows themovement of the barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday nightit fell, then this morning it rose again, and so gently upward tohere. Surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of thedimensions of Space generally recognized? But certainly it tracedsuch a line, and that line, therefore, we must conclude was alongthe Time-Dimension.''But,' said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, 'ifTime is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and whyhas it always been, regarded as something different? And why cannotwe move in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?'The Time Traveller smiled. 'Are you sure we can move freely inSpace? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough,and men always have done so. I admit we move freely in twodimensions. But how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.''Not exactly,' said the Medical Man. 'There are balloons.''But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and theinequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of verticalmovement.''Still they could move a little up and down,' said the Medical Man.'Easier, far easier down than up.''And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from thepresent moment.''My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just wherethe whole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from thepresent moment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and haveno dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniformvelocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel _down_if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth's surface.''But the great difficulty is this,' interrupted the Psychologist.'You _can_ move about in all directions of Space, but you cannotmove about in Time.''That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to saythat we cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recallingan incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence:I become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Ofcourse we have no means of staying back for any length of Time, anymore than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above theground. But a civilized man is better off than the savage in thisrespect. He can go up against gravitation in a balloon, and whyshould he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop oraccelerate his drift along the Time-Dimension, or even turn aboutand travel the other way?''Oh, _this_,' began Filby, 'is all--''Why not?' said the Time Traveller.'It's against reason,' said Filby.'What reason?' said the Time Traveller.'You can show black is white by argument,' said Filby, 'but you willnever convince me.''Possibly not,' said the Time Traveller. 'But now you begin to seethe object of my investigations into the geometry of FourDimensions. Long ago I had a vague inkling of a machine--''To travel through Time!' exclaimed the Very Young Man.'That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time,as the driver determines.'Filby contented himself with laughter.'But I have experimental verification,' said the Time Traveller.'It would be remarkably convenient for the historian,' thePsychologist suggested. 'One might travel back and verify theaccepted account of the Battle of Hastings, for instance!''Don't you think you would attract attention?' said the Medical Man.'Our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.''One might get one's Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,'the Very Young Man thought.'In which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go.The German scholars have improved Greek so much.''Then there is the future,' said the Very Young Man. 'Just think!One might invest all one's money, leave it to accumulate atinterest, and hurry on ahead!''To discover a society,' said I, 'erected on a strictly communisticbasis.''Of all the wild extravagant theories!' began the Psychologist.'Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until--''Experimental verification!' cried I. 'You are going to verify_that_?''The experiment!' cried Filby, who was getting brain-weary.'Let's see your experiment anyhow,' said the Psychologist, 'thoughit's all humbug, you know.'The Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly,and with his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowlyout of the room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the longpassage to his laboratory.The Psychologist looked at us. 'I wonder what he's got?''Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,' said the Medical Man, andFilby tried to tell us about a conjurer he had seen at Burslem; butbefore he had finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, andFilby's anecdote collapsed.The thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glitteringmetallic framework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and verydelicately made. There was ivory in it, and some transparentcrystalline substance. And now I must be explicit, for this thatfollows--unless his explanation is to be accepted--is an absolutelyunaccountable thing. He took one of the small octagonal tables thatwere scattered about the room, and set it in front of the fire, withtwo legs on the hearthrug. On this table he placed the mechanism.Then he drew up a chair, and sat down. The only other object on thetable was a small shaded lamp, the bright light of which fell uponthe model. There were also perhaps a dozen candles about, two inbrass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces, so thatthe room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat in a low arm-chairnearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to be almost betweenthe Time Traveller and the fireplace. Filby sat behind him, lookingover his shoulder. The Medical Man and the Provincial Mayor watchedhim in profile from the right, the Psychologist from the left. TheVery Young Man stood behind the Psychologist. We were all on thealert. It appears incredible to me that any kind of trick, howeversubtly conceived and however adroitly done, could have been playedupon us under these conditions.The Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism. 'Well?'said the Psychologist.'This little affair,' said the Time Traveller, resting his elbowsupon the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus,'is only a model. It is my plan for a machine to travel throughtime. You will notice that it looks singularly askew, and that thereis an odd twinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was insome way unreal.' He pointed to the part with his finger. 'Also,here is one little white lever, and here is another.'The Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing.'It's beautifully made,' he said.'It took two years to make,' retorted the Time Traveller. Then, whenwe had all imitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: 'Now Iwant you clearly to understand that this lever, being pressed over,sends the machine gliding into the future, and this other reversesthe motion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller.Presently I am going to press the lever, and off the machine willgo. It will vanish, pass into future Time, and disappear. Have agood look at the thing. Look at the table too, and satisfyyourselves there is no trickery. I don't want to waste this model,and then be told I'm a quack.'There was a minute's pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about tospeak to me, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forthhis finger towards the lever. 'No,' he said suddenly. 'Lend me yourhand.' And turning to the Psychologist, he took that individual'shand in his own and told him to put out his forefinger. So that itwas the Psychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machineon its interminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I amabsolutely certain there was no trickery. There was a breath ofwind, and the lamp flame jumped. One of the candles on the mantelwas blown out, and the little machine suddenly swung round, becameindistinct, was seen as a ghost for a second perhaps, as an eddy offaintly glittering brass and ivory; and it was gone--vanished! Savefor the lamp the table was bare.Everyone was silent for a minute. Then Filby said he was damned.The Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly lookedunder the table. At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully.'Well?' he said, with a reminiscence of the Psychologist. Then,getting up, he went to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and with hisback to us began to fill his pipe.We stared at each other. 'Look here,' said the Medical Man, 'are youin earnest about this? Do you seriously believe that that machinehas travelled into time?''Certainly,' said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a spill atthe fire. Then he turned, lighting his pipe, to look at thePsychologist's face. (The Psychologist, to show that he was notunhinged, helped himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut.)'What is more, I have a big machine nearly finished in there'--heindicated the laboratory--'and when that is put together I mean tohave a journey on my own account.''You mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?'said Filby.'Into the future or the past--I don't, for certain, know which.'After an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration. 'It must havegone into the past if it has gone anywhere,' he said.'Why?' said the Time Traveller.'Because I presume that it has not moved in space, and if ittravelled into the future it would still be here all this time,since it must have travelled through this time.''But,' I said, 'If it travelled into the past it would have beenvisible when we came first into this room; and last Thursday when wewere here; and the Thursday before that; and so forth!''Serious objections,' remarked the Provincial Mayor, with an air ofimpartiality, turning towards the Time Traveller.'Not a bit,' said the Time Traveller, and, to the Psychologist: 'Youthink. You can explain that. It's presentation below the threshold,you know, diluted presentation.''Of course,' said the Psychologist, and reassured us. 'That's asimple point of psychology. I should have thought of it. It's plainenough, and helps the paradox delightfully. We cannot see it, norcan we appreciate this machine, any more than we can the spoke ofa wheel spinning, or a bullet flying through the air. If it istravelling through time fifty times or a hundred times faster thanwe are, if it gets through a minute while we get through a second,the impression it creates will of course be only one-fiftieth orone-hundredth of what it would make if it were not travelling intime. That's plain enough.' He passed his hand through the space inwhich the machine had been. 'You see?' he said, laughing.We sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so. Then theTime Traveller asked us what we thought of it all.'It sounds plausible enough to-night,' said the Medical Man; 'butwait until to-morrow. Wait for the common sense of the morning.''Would you like to see the Time Machine itself?' asked the TimeTraveller. And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led theway down the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory. I remembervividly the flickering light, his queer, broad head in silhouette,the dance of the shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled butincredulous, and how there in the laboratory we beheld a largeredition of the little mechanism which we had seen vanish from beforeour eyes. Parts were of nickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainlybeen filed or sawn out of rock crystal. The thing was generallycomplete, but the twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon thebench beside some sheets of drawings, and I took one up for a betterlook at it. Quartz it seemed to be.'Look here,' said the Medical Man, 'are you perfectly serious?Or is this a trick--like that ghost you showed us last Christmas?''Upon that machine,' said the Time Traveller, holding the lampaloft, 'I intend to explore time. Is that plain? I was never moreserious in my life.'None of us quite knew how to take it.I caught Filby's eye over the shoulder of the Medical Man, and hewinked at me solemnly.III think that at that time none of us quite believed in the TimeMachine. The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men whoare too clever to be believed: you never felt that you saw all roundhim; you always suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity inambush, behind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model andexplained the matter in the Time Traveller's words, we should haveshown _him_ far less scepticism. For we should have perceived hismotives; a pork butcher could understand Filby. But the TimeTraveller had more than a touch of whim among his elements, and wedistrusted him. Things that would have made the frame of a lessclever man seemed tricks in his hands. It is a mistake to do thingstoo easily. The serious people who took him seriously never feltquite sure of his deportment; they were somehow aware that trustingtheir reputations for judgment with him was like furnishing anursery with egg-shell china. So I don't think any of us said verymuch about time travelling in the interval between that Thursday andthe next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in most ofour minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical incredibleness,the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion itsuggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied with thetrick of the model. That I remember discussing with the Medical Man,whom I met on Friday at the Linnaean. He said he had seen a similarthing at Tubingen, and laid considerable stress on the blowing outof the candle. But how the trick was done he could not explain.The next Thursday I went again to Richmond--I suppose I was one ofthe Time Traveller's most constant guests--and, arriving late, foundfour or five men already assembled in his drawing-room. The MedicalMan was standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one handand his watch in the other. I looked round for the Time Traveller,and--'It's half-past seven now,' said the Medical Man. 'I supposewe'd better have dinner?''Where's----?' said I, naming our host.'You've just come? It's rather odd. He's unavoidably detained. Heasks me in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he's notback. Says he'll explain when he comes.''It seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,' said the Editor of awell-known daily paper; and thereupon the Doctor rang the bell.The Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and myselfwho had attended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank, theEditor aforementioned, a certain journalist, and another--a quiet,shy man with a beard--whom I didn't know, and who, as far as myobservation went, never opened his mouth all the evening. There wassome speculation at the dinner-table about the Time Traveller'sabsence, and I suggested time travelling, in a half-jocular spirit.The Editor wanted that explained to him, and the Psychologistvolunteered a wooden account of the 'ingenious paradox and trick' wehad witnessed that day week. He was in the midst of his expositionwhen the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise. Iwas facing the door, and saw it first. 'Hallo!' I said. 'At last!'And the door opened wider, and the Time Traveller stood before us.I gave a cry of surprise. 'Good heavens! man, what's the matter?'cried the Medical Man, who saw him next. And the whole tablefulturned towards the door.He was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, andsmeared with green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as itseemed to me greyer--either with dust and dirt or because its colourhad actually faded. His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a browncut on it--a cut half healed; his expression was haggard and drawn,as by intense suffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway,as if he had been dazzled by the light. Then he came into the room.He walked with just such a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps.We stared at him in silence, expecting him to speak.He said not a word, but came painfully to the table, and made amotion towards the wine. The Editor filled a glass of champagne, andpushed it towards him. He drained it, and it seemed to do him good:for he looked round the table, and the ghost of his old smileflickered across his face. 'What on earth have you been up to, man?'said the Doctor. The Time Traveller did not seem to hear. 'Don't letme disturb you,' he said, with a certain faltering articulation.'I'm all right.' He stopped, held out his glass for more, and tookit off at a draught. 'That's good,' he said. His eyes grew brighter,and a faint colour came into his cheeks. His glance flickered overour faces with a certain dull approval, and then went round the warmand comfortable room. Then he spoke again, still as it were feelinghis way among his words. 'I'm going to wash and dress, and then I'llcome down and explain things ... Save me some of that mutton. I'mstarving for a bit of meat.'He looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, and hoped hewas all right. The Editor began a question. 'Tell you presently,'said the Time Traveller. 'I'm--funny! Be all right in a minute.'He put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. AgainI remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall,and standing up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out. He hadnothing on them but a pair of tattered, blood-stained socks. Then thedoor closed upon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I rememberedhow he detested any fuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, mymind was wool-gathering. Then, 'Remarkable Behaviour of an EminentScientist,' I heard the Editor say, thinking (after his wont) inheadlines. And this brought my attention back to the brightdinner-table.'What's the game?' said the Journalist. 'Has he been doing theAmateur Cadger? I don't follow.' I met the eye of the Psychologist,and read my own interpretation in his face. I thought of the TimeTraveller limping painfully upstairs. I don't think any one else hadnoticed his lameness.The first to recover completely from this surprise was the MedicalMan, who rang the bell--the Time Traveller hated to have servantswaiting at dinner--for a hot plate. At that the Editor turned to hisknife and fork with a grunt, and the Silent Man followed suit. Thedinner was resumed. Conversation was exclamatory for a little while,with gaps of wonderment; and then the Editor got fervent in hiscuriosity. 'Does our friend eke out his modest income with acrossing? or has he his Nebuchadnezzar phases?' he inquired. 'I feelassured it's this business of the Time Machine,' I said, and took upthe Psychologist's account of our previous meeting. The new guestswere frankly incredulous. The Editor raised objections. 'What _was_this time travelling? A man couldn't cover himself with dust byrolling in a paradox, could he?' And then, as the idea came home tohim, he resorted to caricature. Hadn't they any clothes-brushes inthe Future? The Journalist too, would not believe at any price, andjoined the Editor in the easy work of heaping ridicule on the wholething. They were both the new kind of journalist--very joyous,irreverent young men. 'Our Special Correspondent in the Dayafter To-morrow reports,' the Journalist was saying--or rathershouting--when the Time Traveller came back. He was dressed inordinary evening clothes, and nothing save his haggard look remainedof the change that had startled me.'I say,' said the Editor hilariously, 'these chaps here say you havebeen travelling into the middle of next week! Tell us all aboutlittle Rosebery, will you? What will you take for the lot?'The Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without aword. He smiled quietly, in his old way. 'Where's my mutton?' hesaid. 'What a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again!''Story!' cried the Editor.'Story be damned!' said the Time Traveller. 'I want something toeat. I won't say a word until I get some peptone into my arteries.Thanks. And the salt.''One word,' said I. 'Have you been time travelling?''Yes,' said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding hishead.'I'd give a shilling a line for a verbatim note,' said the Editor.The Time Traveller pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rangit with his fingernail; at which the Silent Man, who had beenstaring at his face, started convulsively, and poured him wine.The rest of the dinner was uncomfortable. For my own part, suddenquestions kept on rising to my lips, and I dare say it was the samewith the others. The Journalist tried to relieve the tension bytelling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. The Time Traveller devoted hisattention to his dinner, and displayed the appetite of a tramp.The Medical Man smoked a cigarette, and watched the Time Travellerthrough his eyelashes. The Silent Man seemed even more clumsy thanusual, and drank champagne with regularity and determination out ofsheer nervousness. At last the Time Traveller pushed his plate away,and looked round us. 'I suppose I must apologize,' he said. 'I wassimply starving. I've had a most amazing time.' He reached out hishand for a cigar, and cut the end. 'But come into the smoking-room.It's too long a story to tell over greasy plates.' And ringing thebell in passing, he led the way into the adjoining room.'You have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?' hesaid to me, leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three newguests.'But the thing's a mere paradox,' said the Editor.'I can't argue to-night. I don't mind telling you the story, butI can't argue. I will,' he went on, 'tell you the story of whathas happened to me, if you like, but you must refrain frominterruptions. I want to tell it. Badly. Most of it will sound likelying. So be it! It's true--every word of it, all the same. I was inmy laboratory at four o'clock, and since then ... I've lived eightdays ... such days as no human being ever lived before! I'm nearlyworn out, but I shan't sleep till I've told this thing over to you.Then I shall go to bed. But no interruptions! Is it agreed?''Agreed,' said the Editor, and the rest of us echoed 'Agreed.' Andwith that the Time Traveller began his story as I have set it forth.He sat back in his chair at first, and spoke like a weary man.Afterwards he got more animated. In writing it down I feel with onlytoo much keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink--and, above all, myown inadequacy--to express its quality. You read, I will suppose,attentively enough; but you cannot see the speaker's white,sincere face in the bright circle of the little lamp, nor hear theintonation of his voice. You cannot know how his expression followedthe turns of his story! Most of us hearers were in shadow, for thecandles in the smoking-room had not been lighted, and only the faceof the Journalist and the legs of the Silent Man from the kneesdownward were illuminated. At first we glanced now and again at eachother. After a time we ceased to do that, and looked only at theTime Traveller's face.III'I told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the TimeMachine, and showed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in theworkshop. There it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one ofthe ivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest ofit's sound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday, but on Friday,when the putting together was nearly done, I found that one of thenickel bars was exactly one inch too short, and this I had to getremade; so that the thing was not complete until this morning. Itwas at ten o'clock to-day that the first of all Time Machines beganits career. I gave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, putone more drop of oil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in thesaddle. I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feelsmuch the same wonder at what will come next as I felt then. I tookthe starting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other,pressed the first, and almost immediately the second. I seemed toreel; I felt a nightmare sensation of falling; and, looking round,I saw the laboratory exactly as before. Had anything happened? Fora moment I suspected that my intellect had tricked me. Then I notedthe clock. A moment before, as it seemed, it had stood at a minuteor so past ten; now it was nearly half-past three!'I drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with bothhands, and went off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and wentdark. Mrs. Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeingme, towards the garden door. I suppose it took her a minute or so totraverse the place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the roomlike a rocket. I pressed the lever over to its extreme position. Thenight came like the turning out of a lamp, and in another momentcame to-morrow. The laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainterand ever fainter. To-morrow night came black, then day again, nightagain, day again, faster and faster still. An eddying murmur filledmy ears, and a strange, dumb confusedness descended on my mind.'I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of timetravelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There is a feelingexactly like that one has upon a switchback--of a helpless headlongmotion! I felt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminentsmash. As I put on pace, night followed day like the flapping of ablack wing. The dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently tofall away from me, and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky,leaping it every minute, and every minute marking a day. I supposedthe laboratory had been destroyed and I had come into the open air.I had a dim impression of scaffolding, but I was already going toofast to be conscious of any moving things. The slowest snail thatever crawled dashed by too fast for me. The twinkling succession ofdarkness and light was excessively painful to the eye. Then, in theintermittent darknesses, I saw the moon spinning swiftly through herquarters from new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the circlingstars. Presently, as I went on, still gaining velocity, thepalpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness;the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a splendid luminouscolor like that of early twilight; the jerking sun became a streakof fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter fluctuatingband; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now and then abrighter circle flickering in the blue.'The landscape was misty and vague. I was still on the hill-sideupon which this house now stands, and the shoulder rose above megrey and dim. I saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour,now brown, now green; they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away.I saw huge buildings rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams.The whole surface of the earth seemed changed--melting and flowingunder my eyes. The little hands upon the dials that registered myspeed raced round faster and faster. Presently I noted that the sunbelt swayed up and down, from solstice to solstice, in a minute orless, and that consequently my pace was over a year a minute; andminute by minute the white snow flashed across the world, andvanished, and was followed by the bright, brief green of spring.'The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now. Theymerged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarkedindeed a clumsy swaying of the machine, for which I was unable toaccount. But my mind was too confused to attend to it, so with akind of madness growing upon me, I flung myself into futurity. Atfirst I scarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything butthese new sensations. But presently a fresh series of impressionsgrew up in my mind--a certain curiosity and therewith a certaindread--until at last they took complete possession of me. Whatstrange developments of humanity, what wonderful advances upon ourrudimentary civilization, I thought, might not appear when I came tolook nearly into the dim elusive world that raced and fluctuatedbefore my eyes! I saw great and splendid architecture rising aboutme, more massive than any buildings of our own time, and yet, as itseemed, built of glimmer and mist. I saw a richer green flow up thehill-side, and remain there, without any wintry intermission. Eventhrough the veil of my confusion the earth seemed very fair. And somy mind came round to the business of stopping.'The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding somesubstance in the space which I, or the machine, occupied. So longas I travelled at a high velocity through time, this scarcelymattered; I was, so to speak, attenuated--was slipping like a vapourthrough the interstices of intervening substances! But to come toa stop involved the jamming of myself, molecule by molecule, intowhatever lay in my way; meant bringing my atoms into such intimatecontact with those of the obstacle that a profound chemicalreaction--possibly a far-reaching explosion--would result, and blowmyself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions--into theUnknown. This possibility had occurred to me again and again while Iwas making the machine; but then I had cheerfully accepted it as anunavoidable risk--one of the risks a man has got to take! Now therisk was inevitable, I no longer saw it in the same cheerful light.The fact is that, insensibly, the absolute strangeness of everything,the sickly jarring and swaying of the machine, above all, thefeeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely upset my nerve. I toldmyself that I could never stop, and with a gust of petulance Iresolved to stop forthwith. Like an impatient fool, I lugged overthe lever, and incontinently the thing went reeling over, and I wasflung headlong through the air.'There was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears. I may havebeen stunned for a moment. A pitiless hail was hissing round me,and I was sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine.Everything still seemed grey, but presently I remarked that theconfusion in my ears was gone. I looked round me. I was on whatseemed to be a little lawn in a garden, surrounded by rhododendronbushes, and I noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms weredropping in a shower under the beating of the hail-stones. Therebounding, dancing hail hung in a cloud over the machine, and drovealong the ground like smoke. In a moment I was wet to the skin.&quot;Fine hospitality,&quot; said I, &quot;to a man who has travelled innumerableyears to see you.&quot;'Presently I thought what a fool I was to get wet. I stood up andlooked round me. A colossal figure, carved apparently in some whitestone, loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazydownpour. But all else of the world was invisible.'My sensations would be hard to describe. As the columns of hailgrew thinner, I saw the white figure more distinctly. It was verylarge, for a silver birch-tree touched its shoulder. It was of whitemarble, in shape something like a winged sphinx, but the wings,instead of being carried vertically at the sides, were spread sothat it seemed to hover. The pedestal, it appeared to me, was ofbronze, and was thick with verdigris. It chanced that the face wastowards me; the sightless eyes seemed to watch me; there was thefaint shadow of a smile on the lips. It was greatly weather-worn,and that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease. I stoodlooking at it for a little space--half a minute, perhaps, or half anhour. It seemed to advance and to recede as the hail drove before itdenser or thinner. At last I tore my eyes from it for a moment andsaw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare, and that the sky waslightening with the promise of the sun.'I looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the fulltemerity of my voyage came suddenly upon me. What might appear whenthat hazy curtain was altogether withdrawn? What might not havehappened to men? What if cruelty had grown into a common passion?What if in this interval the race had lost its manliness and haddeveloped into something inhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelminglypowerful? I might seem some old-world savage animal, only the moredreadful and disgusting for our common likeness--a foul creature tobe incontinently slain.'Already I saw other vast shapes--huge buildings with intricateparapets and tall columns, with a wooded hill-side dimly creepingin upon me through the lessening storm. I was seized with a panicfear. I turned frantically to the Time Machine, and strove hard toreadjust it. As I did so the shafts of the sun smote through thethunderstorm. The grey downpour was swept aside and vanished likethe trailing garments of a ghost. Above me, in the intense blueof the summer sky, some faint brown shreds of cloud whirled intonothingness. The great buildings about me stood out clear anddistinct, shining with the wet of the thunderstorm, and picked outin white by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses. Ifelt naked in a strange world. I felt as perhaps a bird may feel inthe clear air, knowing the hawk wings above and will swoop. My feargrew to frenzy. I took a breathing space, set my teeth, and againgrappled fiercely, wrist and knee, with the machine. It gave undermy desperate onset and turned over. It struck my chin violently. Onehand on the saddle, the other on the lever, I stood panting heavilyin attitude to mount again.'But with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered. Ilooked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remotefuture. In a circular opening, high up in the wall of the nearerhouse, I saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes. They hadseen me, and their faces were directed towards me.'Then I heard voices approaching me. Coming through the bushes bythe White Sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running. One ofthese emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn uponwhich I stood with my machine. He was a slight creature--perhapsfour feet high--clad in a purple tunic, girdled at the waist with aleather belt. Sandals or buskins--I could not clearly distinguishwhich--were on his feet; his legs were bare to the knees, and hishead was bare. Noticing that, I noticed for the first time how warmthe air was.'He struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, butindescribably frail. His flushed face reminded me of the morebeautiful kind of consumptive--that hectic beauty of which we usedto hear so much. At the sight of him I suddenly regained confidence.I took my hands from the machine.IV'In another moment we were standing face to face, I and this fragilething out of futurity. He came straight up to me and laughed into myeyes. The absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me atonce. Then he turned to the two others who were following him andspoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue.'There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhapseight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me. One of themaddressed me. It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice wastoo harsh and deep for them. So I shook my head, and, pointing to myears, shook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and thentouched my hand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon myback and shoulders. They wanted to make sure I was real. There wasnothing in this at all alarming. Indeed, there was something inthese pretty little people that inspired confidence--a gracefulgentleness, a certain childlike ease. And besides, they looked sofrail that I could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of themabout like nine-pins. But I made a sudden motion to warn them when Isaw their little pink hands feeling at the Time Machine. Happilythen, when it was not too late, I thought of a danger I had hithertoforgotten, and reaching over the bars of the machine I unscrewed thelittle levers that would set it in motion, and put these in mypocket. Then I turned again to see what I could do in the way ofcommunication.'And then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw somefurther peculiarities in their Dresden-china type of prettiness.Their hair, which was uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at theneck and cheek; there was not the faintest suggestion of it on theface, and their ears were singularly minute. The mouths were small,with bright red, rather thin lips, and the little chins ran to apoint. The eyes were large and mild; and--this may seem egotism onmy part--I fancied even that there was a certain lack of theinterest I might have expected in them.'As they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stoodround me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, Ibegan the conversation. I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself.Then hesitating for a moment how to express time, I pointed to thesun. At once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple andwhite followed my gesture, and then astonished me by imitating thesound of thunder.'For a moment I was staggered, though the import of his gesture wasplain enough. The question had come into my mind abruptly: werethese creatures fools? You may hardly understand how it took me.You see I had always anticipated that the people of the year EightHundred and Two Thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us inknowledge, art, everything. Then one of them suddenly asked me aquestion that showed him to be on the intellectual level of one ofour five-year-old children--asked me, in fact, if I had come fromthe sun in a thunderstorm! It let loose the judgment I had suspendedupon their clothes, their frail light limbs, and fragile features.A flow of disappointment rushed across my mind. For a moment I feltthat I had built the Time Machine in vain.'I nodded, pointed to the sun, and gave them such a vivid renderingof a thunderclap as startled them. They all withdrew a pace or soand bowed. Then came one laughing towards me, carrying a chain ofbeautiful flowers altogether new to me, and put it about my neck.The idea was received with melodious applause; and presently theywere all running to and fro for flowers, and laughingly flingingthem upon me until I was almost smothered with blossom. You whohave never seen the like can scarcely imagine what delicate andwonderful flowers countless years of culture had created. Thensomeone suggested that their plaything should be exhibited in thenearest building, and so I was led past the sphinx of white marble,which had seemed to watch me all the while with a smile at myastonishment, towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone. As Iwent with them the memory of my confident anticipations of aprofoundly grave and intellectual posterity came, with irresistiblemerriment, to my mind.'The building had a huge entry, and was altogether of colossaldimensions. I was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd oflittle people, and with the big open portals that yawned before meshadowy and mysterious. My general impression of the world I sawover their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes andflowers, a long neglected and yet weedless garden. I saw a numberof tall spikes of strange white flowers, measuring a foot perhapsacross the spread of the waxen petals. They grew scattered, as ifwild, among the variegated shrubs, but, as I say, I did not examinethem closely at this time. The Time Machine was left deserted on theturf among the rhododendrons.'The arch of the doorway was richly carved, but naturally I didnot observe the carving very narrowly, though I fancied I sawsuggestions of old Phoenician decorations as I passed through, andit struck me that they were very badly broken and weather-worn.Several more brightly clad people met me in the doorway, and so weentered, I, dressed in dingy nineteenth-century garments, lookinggrotesque enough, garlanded with flowers, and surrounded by aneddying mass of bright, soft-colored robes and shining white limbs,in a melodious whirl of laughter and laughing speech.'The big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung withbrown. The roof was in shadow, and the windows, partially glazedwith coloured glass and partially unglazed, admitted a temperedlight. The floor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard whitemetal, not plates nor slabs--blocks, and it was so much worn, as Ijudged by the going to and fro of past generations, as to be deeplychannelled along the more frequented ways. Transverse to the lengthwere innumerable tables made of slabs of polished stone, raisedperhaps a foot from the floor, and upon these were heaps of fruits.Some I recognized as a kind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange,but for the most part they were strange.'Between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions.Upon these my conductors seated themselves, signing for me to dolikewise. With a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat thefruit with their hands, flinging peel and stalks, and so forth, intothe round openings in the sides of the tables. I was not loath tofollow their example, for I felt thirsty and hungry. As I did so Isurveyed the hall at my leisure.'And perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look.The stained-glass windows, which displayed only a geometricalpattern, were broken in many places, and the curtains that hungacross the lower end were thick with dust. And it caught my eye thatthe corner of the marble table near me was fractured. Nevertheless,the general effect was extremely rich and picturesque. There were,perhaps, a couple of hundred people dining in the hall, and most ofthem, seated as near to me as they could come, were watching me withinterest, their little eyes shining over the fruit they were eating.All were clad in the same soft and yet strong, silky material.'Fruit, by the by, was all their diet. These people of the remotefuture were strict vegetarians, and while I was with them, in spiteof some carnal cravings, I had to be frugivorous also. Indeed, Ifound afterwards that horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, had followed theIchthyosaurus into extinction. But the fruits were very delightful;one, in particular, that seemed to be in season all the time I wasthere--a floury thing in a three-sided husk--was especially good,and I made it my staple. At first I was puzzled by all these strangefruits, and by the strange flowers I saw, but later I began toperceive their import.'However, I am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant futurenow. So soon as my appetite was a little checked, I determined tomake a resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men ofmine. Clearly that was the next thing to do. The fruits seemed aconvenient thing to begin upon, and holding one of these up I begana series of interrogative sounds and gestures. I had someconsiderable difficulty in conveying my meaning. At first my effortsmet with a stare of surprise or inextinguishable laughter, butpresently a fair-haired little creature seemed to grasp my intentionand repeated a name. They had to chatter and explain the businessat great length to each other, and my first attempts to make theexquisite little sounds of their language caused an immense amountof amusement. However, I felt like a schoolmaster amidst children,and persisted, and presently I had a score of noun substantives atleast at my command; and then I got to demonstrative pronouns, andeven the verb &quot;to eat.&quot; But it was slow work, and the little peoplesoon tired and wanted to get away from my interrogations, so Idetermined, rather of necessity, to let them give their lessons inlittle doses when they felt inclined. And very little doses I foundthey were before long, for I never met people more indolent or moreeasily fatigued.'A queer thing I soon discovered about my little hosts, and that wastheir lack of interest. They would come to me with eager cries ofastonishment, like children, but like children they would soon stopexamining me and wander away after some other toy. The dinner and myconversational beginnings ended, I noted for the first time thatalmost all those who had surrounded me at first were gone. It isodd, too, how speedily I came to disregard these little people. Iwent out through the portal into the sunlit world again as soon asmy hunger was satisfied. I was continually meeting more of these menof the future, who would follow me a little distance, chatter andlaugh about me, and, having smiled and gesticulated in a friendlyway, leave me again to my own devices.'The calm of evening was upon the world as I emerged from the greathall, and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun.At first things were very confusing. Everything was so entirelydifferent from the world I had known--even the flowers. The bigbuilding I had left was situated on the slope of a broad rivervalley, but the Thames had shifted perhaps a mile from its presentposition. I resolved to mount to the summit of a crest, perhaps amile and a half away, from which I could get a wider view of thisour planet in the year Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundredand One A.D. For that, I should explain, was the date the littledials of my machine recorded.'As I walked I was watching for every impression that could possiblyhelp to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which Ifound the world--for ruinous it was. A little way up the hill, forinstance, was a great heap of granite, bound together by masses ofaluminium, a vast labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpledheaps, amidst which were thick heaps of very beautiful pagoda-likeplants--nettles possibly--but wonderfully tinted with brown aboutthe leaves, and incapable of stinging. It was evidently the derelictremains of some vast structure, to what end built I could notdetermine. It was here that I was destined, at a later date, to havea very strange experience--the first intimation of a still strangerdiscovery--but of that I will speak in its proper place.'Looking round with a sudden thought, from a terrace on which Irested for a while, I realized that there were no small houses to beseen. Apparently the single house, and possibly even the household,had vanished. Here and there among the greenery were palace-likebuildings, but the house and the cottage, which form suchcharacteristic features of our own English landscape, haddisappeared.'&quot;Communism,&quot; said I to myself.'And on the heels of that came another thought. I looked at thehalf-dozen little figures that were following me. Then, in a flash,I perceived that all had the same form of costume, the same softhairless visage, and the same girlish rotundity of limb. It may seemstrange, perhaps, that I had not noticed this before. But everythingwas so strange. Now, I saw the fact plainly enough. In costume, andin all the differences of texture and bearing that now mark off thesexes from each other, these people of the future were alike. Andthe children seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of theirparents. I judged, then, that the children of that time wereextremely precocious, physically at least, and I found afterwardsabundant verification of my opinion.'Seeing the ease and security in which these people were living, Ifelt that this close resemblance of the sexes was after all whatone would expect; for the strength of a man and the softness of awoman, the institution of the family, and the differentiation ofoccupations are mere militant necessities of an age of physicalforce; where population is balanced and abundant, much childbearingbecomes an evil rather than a blessing to the State; whereviolence comes but rarely and off-spring are secure, there is lessnecessity--indeed there is no necessity--for an efficient family,and the specialization of the sexes with reference to theirchildren's needs disappears. We see some beginnings of this evenin our own time, and in this future age it was complete. This, Imust remind you, was my speculation at the time. Later, I was toappreciate how far it fell short of the reality.'While I was musing upon these things, my attention was attracted bya pretty little structure, like a well under a cupola. I thought ina transitory way of the oddness of wells still existing, and thenresumed the thread of my speculations. There were no large buildingstowards the top of the hill, and as my walking powers were evidentlymiraculous, I was presently left alone for the first time. With astrange sense of freedom and adventure I pushed on up to the crest.'There I found a seat of some yellow metal that I did not recognize,corroded in places with a kind of pinkish rust and half smotheredin soft moss, the arm-rests cast and filed into the resemblance ofgriffins' heads. I sat down on it, and I surveyed the broad view ofour old world under the sunset of that long day. It was as sweet andfair a view as I have ever seen. The sun had already gone below thehorizon and the west was flaming gold, touched with some horizontalbars of purple and crimson. Below was the valley of the Thames, inwhich the river lay like a band of burnished steel. I have alreadyspoken of the great palaces dotted about among the variegatedgreenery, some in ruins and some still occupied. Here and there rosea white or silvery figure in the waste garden of the earth, here andthere came the sharp vertical line of some cupola or obelisk. Therewere no hedges, no signs of proprietary rights, no evidences ofagriculture; the whole earth had become a garden.'So watching, I began to put my interpretation upon the things I hadseen, and as it shaped itself to me that evening, my interpretationwas something in this way. (Afterwards I found I had got only ahalf-truth--or only a glimpse of one facet of the truth.)'It seemed to me that I had happened upon humanity upon the wane.The ruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind. For thefirst time I began to realize an odd consequence of the socialeffort in which we are at present engaged. And yet, come to think,it is a logical consequence enough. Strength is the outcome of need;security sets a premium on feebleness. The work of ameliorating theconditions of life--the true civilizing process that makes life moreand more secure--had gone steadily on to a climax. One triumph of aunited humanity over Nature had followed another. Things that arenow mere dreams had become projects deliberately put in hand andcarried forward. And the harvest was what I saw!'After all, the sanitation and the agriculture of to-day are stillin the rudimentary stage. The science of our time has attacked buta little department of the field of human disease, but even so,it spreads its operations very steadily and persistently. Ouragriculture and horticulture destroy a weed just here and there andcultivate perhaps a score or so of wholesome plants, leaving thegreater number to fight out a balance as they can. We improve ourfavourite plants and animals--and how few they are--gradually byselective breeding; now a new and better peach, now a seedlessgrape, now a sweeter and larger flower, now a more convenient breedof cattle. We improve them gradually, because our ideals are vagueand tentative, and our knowledge is very limited; because Nature,too, is shy and slow in our clumsy hands. Some day all this willbe better organized, and still better. That is the drift of thecurrent in spite of the eddies. The whole world will be intelligent,educated, and co-operating; things will move faster and fastertowards the subjugation of Nature. In the end, wisely and carefullywe shall readjust the balance of animal and vegetable life to suitour human needs.'This adjustment, I say, must have been done, and done well; doneindeed for all Time, in the space of Time across which my machinehad leaped. The air was free from gnats, the earth from weeds orfungi; everywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers;brilliant butterflies flew hither and thither. The ideal ofpreventive medicine was attained. Diseases had been stamped out. Isaw no evidence of any contagious diseases during all my stay. And Ishall have to tell you later that even the processes of putrefactionand decay had been profoundly affected by these changes.'Social triumphs, too, had been effected. I saw mankind housed insplendid shelters, gloriously clothed, and as yet I had found themengaged in no toil. There were no signs of struggle, neither socialnor economical struggle. The shop, the advertisement, traffic, allthat commerce which constitutes the body of our world, was gone. Itwas natural on that golden evening that I should jump at the idea ofa social paradise. The difficulty of increasing population had beenmet, I guessed, and population had ceased to increase.'But with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations tothe change. What, unless biological science is a mass of errors, isthe cause of human intelligence and vigour? Hardship and freedom:conditions under which the active, strong, and subtle survive andthe weaker go to the wall; conditions that put a premium upon theloyal alliance of capable men, upon self-restraint, patience, anddecision. And the institution of the family, and the emotions thatarise therein, the fierce jealousy, the tenderness for offspring,parental self-devotion, all found their justification and support inthe imminent dangers of the young. _Now_, where are these imminentdangers? There is a sentiment arising, and it will grow, againstconnubial jealousy, against fierce maternity, against passionof all sorts; unnecessary things now, and things that make usuncomfortable, savage survivals, discords in a refined and pleasantlife.'I thought of the physical slightness of the people, their lack ofintelligence, and those big abundant ruins, and it strengthened mybelief in a perfect conquest of Nature. For after the battle comesQuiet. Humanity had been strong, energetic, and intelligent, and hadused all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under whichit lived. And now came the reaction of the altered conditions.'Under the new conditions of perfect comfort and security, thatrestless energy, that with us is strength, would become weakness.Even in our own time certain tendencies and desires, once necessaryto survival, are a constant source of failure. Physical courage andthe love of battle, for instance, are no great help--may even behindrances--to a civilized man. And in a state of physical balanceand security, power, intellectual as well as physical, would be outof place. For countless years I judged there had been no danger ofwar or solitary violence, no danger from wild beasts, no wastingdisease to require strength of constitution, no need of toil. Forsuch a life, what we should call the weak are as well equipped asthe strong, are indeed no longer weak. Better equipped indeed theyare, for the strong would be fretted by an energy for which therewas no outlet. No doubt the exquisite beauty of the buildings I sawwas the outcome of the last surgings of the now purposeless energyof mankind before it settled down into perfect harmony with theconditions under which it lived--the flourish of that triumph whichbegan the last great peace. This has ever been the fate of energy insecurity; it takes to art and to eroticism, and then come languorand decay.'Even this artistic impetus would at last die away--had almost diedin the Time I saw. To adorn themselves with flowers, to dance, tosing in the sunlight: so much was left of the artistic spirit, andno more. Even that would fade in the end into a contentedinactivity. We are kept keen on the grindstone of pain andnecessity, and, it seemed to me, that here was that hatefulgrindstone broken at last!'As I stood there in the gathering dark I thought that in thissimple explanation I had mastered the problem of the world--masteredthe whole secret of these delicious people. Possibly the checks theyhad devised for the increase of population had succeeded too well,and their numbers had rather diminished than kept stationary.That would account for the abandoned ruins. Very simple was myexplanation, and plausible enough--as most wrong theories are!V'As I stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man, thefull moon, yellow and gibbous, came up out of an overflow of silverlight in the north-east. The bright little figures ceased to moveabout below, a noiseless owl flitted by, and I shivered with thechill of the night. I determined to descend and find where I couldsleep.'I looked for the building I knew. Then my eye travelled along tothe figure of the White Sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze, growingdistinct as the light of the rising moon grew brighter. I could seethe silver birch against it. There was the tangle of rhododendronbushes, black in the pale light, and there was the little lawn.I looked at the lawn again. A queer doubt chilled my complacency.&quot;No,&quot; said I stoutly to myself, &quot;that was not the lawn.&quot;'But it _was_ the lawn. For the white leprous face of the sphinx wastowards it. Can you imagine what I felt as this conviction camehome to me? But you cannot. The Time Machine was gone!'At once, like a lash across the face, came the possibility oflosing my own age, of being left helpless in this strange new world.The bare thought of it was an actual physical sensation. I couldfeel it grip me at the throat and stop my breathing. In anothermoment I was in a passion of fear and running with great leapingstrides down the slope. Once I fell headlong and cut my face; I lostno time in stanching the blood, but jumped up and ran on, with awarm trickle down my cheek and chin. All the time I ran I was sayingto myself: &quot;They have moved it a little, pushed it under the bushesout of the way.&quot; Nevertheless, I ran with all my might. All thetime, with the certainty that sometimes comes with excessive dread,I knew that such assurance was folly, knew instinctively that themachine was removed out of my reach. My breath came with pain. Isuppose I covered the whole distance from the hill crest to thelittle lawn, two miles perhaps, in ten minutes. And I am not a youngman. I cursed aloud, as I ran, at my confident folly in leaving themachine, wasting good breath thereby. I cried aloud, and noneanswered. Not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlitworld.'When I reached the lawn my worst fears were realized. Not a traceof the thing was to be seen. I felt faint and cold when I faced theempty space among the black tangle of bushes. I ran round itfuriously, as if the thing might be hidden in a corner, and thenstopped abruptly, with my hands clutching my hair. Above me toweredthe sphinx, upon the bronze pedestal, white, shining, leprous, inthe light of the rising moon. It seemed to smile in mockery of mydismay.'I might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had putthe mechanism in some shelter for me, had I not felt assured oftheir physical and intellectual inadequacy. That is what dismayedme: the sense of some hitherto unsuspected power, through whoseintervention my invention had vanished. Yet, for one thing I feltassured: unless some other age had produced its exact duplicate,the machine could not have moved in time. The attachment of thelevers--I will show you the method later--prevented any one fromtampering with it in that way when they were removed. It had moved,and was hid, only in space. But then, where could it be?'I think I must have had a kind of frenzy. I remember runningviolently in and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx,and startling some white animal that, in the dim light, I took for asmall deer. I remember, too, late that night, beating the busheswith my clenched fist until my knuckles were gashed and bleedingfrom the broken twigs. Then, sobbing and raving in my anguish ofmind, I went down to the great building of stone. The big hall wasdark, silent, and deserted. I slipped on the uneven floor, and fellover one of the malachite tables, almost breaking my shin. I lit amatch and went on past the dusty curtains, of which I have told you.'There I found a second great hall covered with cushions, uponwhich, perhaps, a score or so of the little people were sleeping. Ihave no doubt they found my second appearance strange enough, comingsuddenly out of the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises and thesplutter and flare of a match. For they had forgotten about matches.&quot;Where is my Time Machine?&quot; I began, bawling like an angry child,laying hands upon them and shaking them up together. It must havebeen very queer to them. Some laughed, most of them looked sorelyfrightened. When I saw them standing round me, it came into my headthat I was doing as foolish a thing as it was possible for me to dounder the circumstances, in trying to revive the sensation of fear.For, reasoning from their daylight behaviour, I thought that fearmust be forgotten.'Abruptly, I dashed down the match, and, knocking one of the peopleover in my course, went blundering across the big dining-hall again,out under the moonlight. I heard cries of terror and their littlefeet running and stumbling this way and that. I do not remember allI did as the moon crept up the sky. I suppose it was the unexpectednature of my loss that maddened me. I felt hopelessly cut off frommy own kind--a strange animal in an unknown world. I must have ravedto and fro, screaming and crying upon God and Fate. I have a memoryof horrible fatigue, as the long night of despair wore away; oflooking in this impossible place and that; of groping among moon-litruins and touching strange creatures in the black shadows; at last,of lying on the ground near the sphinx and weeping with absolutewretchedness. I had nothing left but misery. Then I slept, and whenI woke again it was full day, and a couple of sparrows were hoppinground me on the turf within reach of my arm.'I sat up in the freshness of the morning, trying to remember howI had got there, and why I had such a profound sense of desertionand despair. Then things came clear in my mind. With the plain,reasonable daylight, I could look my circumstances fairly in theface. I saw the wild folly of my frenzy overnight, and I couldreason with myself. &quot;Suppose the worst?&quot; I said. &quot;Suppose themachine altogether lost--perhaps destroyed? It behoves me to becalm and patient, to learn the way of the people, to get a clearidea of the method of my loss, and the means of getting materialsand tools; so that in the end, perhaps, I may make another.&quot; Thatwould be my only hope, perhaps, but better than despair. And, afterall, it was a beautiful and curious world.'But probably, the machine had only been taken away. Still, I mustbe calm and patient, find its hiding-place, and recover it by forceor cunning. And with that I scrambled to my feet and looked aboutme, wondering where I could bathe. I felt weary, stiff, andtravel-soiled. The freshness of the morning made me desire an equalfreshness. I had exhausted my emotion. Indeed, as I went aboutmy business, I found myself wondering at my intense excitementovernight. I made a careful examination of the ground about thelittle lawn. I wasted some time in futile questionings, conveyed, aswell as I was able, to such of the little people as came by. Theyall failed to understand my gestures; some were simply stolid, somethought it was a jest and laughed at me. I had the hardest task inthe world to keep my hands off their pretty laughing faces. It wasa foolish impulse, but the devil begotten of fear and blind angerwas ill curbed and still eager to take advantage of my perplexity.The turf gave better counsel. I found a groove ripped in it, aboutmidway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of my feetwhere, on arrival, I had struggled with the overturned machine.There were other signs of removal about, with queer narrowfootprints like those I could imagine made by a sloth. This directedmy closer attention to the pedestal. It was, as I think I have said,of bronze. It was not a mere block, but highly decorated with deepframed panels on either side. I went and rapped at these. Thepedestal was hollow. Examining the panels with care I found themdiscontinuous with the frames. There were no handles or keyholes,but possibly the panels, if they were doors, as I supposed, openedfrom within. One thing was clear enough to my mind. It took no verygreat mental effort to infer that my Time Machine was inside thatpedestal. But how it got there was a different problem.'I saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the bushesand under some blossom-covered apple-trees towards me. I turnedsmiling to them and beckoned them to me. They came, and then,pointing to the bronze pedestal, I tried to intimate my wish to openit. But at my first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly. Idon't know how to convey their expression to you. Suppose you wereto use a grossly improper gesture to a delicate-minded woman--it ishow she would look. They went off as if they had received the lastpossible insult. I tried a sweet-looking little chap in white next,with exactly the same result. Somehow, his manner made me feelashamed of myself. But, as you know, I wanted the Time Machine, andI tried him once more. As he turned off, like the others, my tempergot the better of me. In three strides I was after him, had him bythe loose part of his robe round the neck, and began dragging himtowards the sphinx. Then I saw the horror and repugnance of hisface, and all of a sudden I let him go.'But I was not beaten yet. I banged with my fist at the bronzepanels. I thought I heard something stir inside--to be explicit,I thought I heard a sound like a chuckle--but I must have beenmistaken. Then I got a big pebble from the river, and came andhammered till I had flattened a coil in the decorations, and theverdigris came off in powdery flakes. The delicate little peoplemust have heard me hammering in gusty outbreaks a mile away oneither hand, but nothing came of it. I saw a crowd of them upon theslopes, looking furtively at me. At last, hot and tired, I sat downto watch the place. But I was too restless to watch long; I am tooOccidental for a long vigil. I could work at a problem for years,but to wait inactive for twenty-four hours--that is another matter.'I got up after a time, and began walking aimlessly through thebushes towards the hill again. &quot;Patience,&quot; said I to myself. &quot;If youwant your machine again you must leave that sphinx alone. If theymean to take your machine away, it's little good your wrecking theirbronze panels, and if they don't, you will get it back as soon asyou can ask for it. To sit among all those unknown things before apuzzle like that is hopeless. That way lies monomania. Face thisworld. Learn its ways, watch it, be careful of too hasty guessesat its meaning. In the end you will find clues to it all.&quot; Thensuddenly the humour of the situation came into my mind: the thoughtof the years I had spent in study and toil to get into the futureage, and now my passion of anxiety to get out of it. I had mademyself the most complicated and the most hopeless trap that ever aman devised. Although it was at my own expense, I could not helpmyself. I laughed aloud.'Going through the big palace, it seemed to me that the littlepeople avoided me. It may have been my fancy, or it may have hadsomething to do with my hammering at the gates of bronze. Yet I felttolerably sure of the avoidance. I was careful, however, to show noconcern and to abstain from any pursuit of them, and in the courseof a day or two things got back to the old footing. I made whatprogress I could in the language, and in addition I pushed myexplorations here and there. Either I missed some subtle point ortheir language was excessively simple--almost exclusively composedof concrete substantives and verbs. There seemed to be few, if any,abstract terms, or little use of figurative language. Theirsentences were usually simple and of two words, and I failed toconvey or understand any but the simplest propositions. I determinedto put the thought of my Time Machine and the mystery of the bronzedoors under the sphinx as much as possible in a corner of memory,until my growing knowledge would lead me back to them in a naturalway. Yet a certain feeling, you may understand, tethered me in acircle of a few miles round the point of my arrival.'So far as I could see, all the world displayed the same exuberantrichness as the Thames valley. From every hill I climbed I saw thesame abundance of splendid buildings, endlessly varied in materialand style, the same clustering thickets of evergreens, the sameblossom-laden trees and tree-ferns. Here and there water shone likesilver, and beyond, the land rose into blue undulating hills, andso faded into the serenity of the sky. A peculiar feature, whichpresently attracted my attention, was the presence of certaincircular wells, several, as it seemed to me, of a very great depth.One lay by the path up the hill, which I had followed during myfirst walk. Like the others, it was rimmed with bronze, curiouslywrought, and protected by a little cupola from the rain. Sitting bythe side of these wells, and peering down into the shafted darkness,I could see no gleam of water, nor could I start any reflectionwith a lighted match. But in all of them I heard a certain sound:a thud--thud--thud, like the beating of some big engine; and Idiscovered, from the flaring of my matches, that a steady current ofair set down the shafts. Further, I threw a scrap of paper into thethroat of one, and, instead of fluttering slowly down, it was atonce sucked swiftly out of sight.'After a time, too, I came to connect these wells with tall towersstanding here and there upon the slopes; for above them there wasoften just such a flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day abovea sun-scorched beach. Putting things together, I reached a strongsuggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation, whosetrue import it was difficult to imagine. I was at first inclined toassociate it with the sanitary apparatus of these people. It was anobvious conclusion, but it was absolutely wrong.'And here I must admit that I learned very little of drains andbells and modes of conveyance, and the like conveniences, during mytime in this real future. In some of these visions of Utopias andcoming times which I have read, there is a vast amount of detailabout building, and social arrangements, and so forth. But whilesuch details are easy enough to obtain when the whole world iscontained in one's imagination, they are altogether inaccessible toa real traveller amid such realities as I found here. Conceive thetale of London which a negro, fresh from Central Africa, would takeback to his tribe! What would he know of railway companies, ofsocial movements, of telephone and telegraph wires, of the ParcelsDelivery Company, and postal orders and the like? Yet we, at least,should be willing enough to explain these things to him! And even ofwhat he knew, how much could he make his untravelled friend eitherapprehend or believe? Then, think how narrow the gap between a negroand a white man of our own times, and how wide the interval betweenmyself and these of the Golden Age! I was sensible of much which wasunseen, and which contributed to my comfort; but save for a generalimpression of automatic organization, I fear I can convey verylittle of the difference to your mind.'In the matter of sepulture, for instance, I could see no signs ofcrematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs. But it occurred to methat, possibly, there might be cemeteries (or crematoria) somewherebeyond the range of my explorings. This, again, was a question Ideliberately put to myself, and my curiosity was at first entirelydefeated upon the point. The thing puzzled me, and I was led to makea further remark, which puzzled me still more: that aged and infirmamong this people there were none.'I must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of anautomatic civilization and a decadent humanity did not long endure.Yet I could think of no other. Let me put my difficulties. Theseveral big palaces I had explored were mere living places, greatdining-halls and sleeping apartments. I could find no machinery, noappliances of any kind. Yet these people were clothed in pleasantfabrics that must at times need renewal, and their sandals, thoughundecorated, were fairly complex specimens of metalwork. Somehowsuch things must be made. And the little people displayed no vestigeof a creative tendency. There were no shops, no workshops, no signof importations among them. They spent all their time in playinggently, in bathing in the river, in making love in a half-playfulfashion, in eating fruit and sleeping. I could not see how thingswere kept going.'Then, again, about the Time Machine: something, I knew not what,had taken it into the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx. Why? Forthe life of me I could not imagine. Those waterless wells, too,those flickering pillars. I felt I lacked a clue. I felt--how shallI put it? Suppose you found an inscription, with sentences here andthere in excellent plain English, and interpolated therewith, othersmade up of words, of letters even, absolutely unknown to you? Well,on the third day of my visit, that was how the world of EightHundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One presented itself tome!'That day, too, I made a friend--of a sort. It happened that, as Iwas watching some of the little people bathing in a shallow, one ofthem was seized with cramp and began drifting downstream. The maincurrent ran rather swiftly, but not too strongly for even a moderateswimmer. It will give you an idea, therefore, of the strangedeficiency in these creatures, when I tell you that none made theslightest attempt to rescue the weakly crying little thing whichwas drowning before their eyes. When I realized this, I hurriedlyslipped off my clothes, and, wading in at a point lower down, Icaught the poor mite and drew her safe to land. A little rubbing ofthe limbs soon brought her round, and I had the satisfaction ofseeing she was all right before I left her. I had got to such a lowestimate of her kind that I did not expect any gratitude from her.In that, however, I was wrong.'This happened in the morning. In the afternoon I met my littlewoman, as I believe it was, as I was returning towards my centrefrom an exploration, and she received me with cries of delight andpresented me with a big garland of flowers--evidently made for meand me alone. The thing took my imagination. Very possibly I hadbeen feeling desolate. At any rate I did my best to display myappreciation of the gift. We were soon seated together in a littlestone arbour, engaged in conversation, chiefly of smiles. Thecreature's friendliness affected me exactly as a child's might havedone. We passed each other flowers, and she kissed my hands. I didthe same to hers. Then I tried talk, and found that her name wasWeena, which, though I don't know what it meant, somehow seemedappropriate enough. That was the beginning of a queer friendshipwhich lasted a week, and ended--as I will tell you!'She was exactly like a child. She wanted to be with me always. Shetried to follow me everywhere, and on my next journey out and aboutit went to my heart to tire her down, and leave her at last,exhausted and calling after me rather plaintively. But the problemsof the world had to be mastered. I had not, I said to myself, comeinto the future to carry on a miniature flirtation. Yet her distresswhen I left her was very great, her expostulations at the partingwere sometimes frantic, and I think, altogether, I had as muchtrouble as comfort from her devotion. Nevertheless she was, somehow,a very great comfort. I thought it was mere childish affection thatmade her cling to me. Until it was too late, I did not clearly knowwhat I had inflicted upon her when I left her. Nor until it was toolate did I clearly understand what she was to me. For, by merelyseeming fond of me, and showing in her weak, futile way that shecared for me, the little doll of a creature presently gave my returnto the neighbourhood of the White Sphinx almost the feeling ofcoming home; and I would watch for her tiny figure of white and goldso soon as I came over the hill.'It was from her, too, that I learned that fear had not yet left theworld. She was fearless enough in the daylight, and she had theoddest confidence in me; for once, in a foolish moment, I madethreatening grimaces at her, and she simply laughed at them. But shedreaded the dark, dreaded shadows, dreaded black things. Darknessto her was the one thing dreadful. It was a singularly passionateemotion, and it set me thinking and observing. I discovered then,among other things, that these little people gathered into the greathouses after dark, and slept in droves. To enter upon them without alight was to put them into a tumult of apprehension. I never foundone out of doors, or one sleeping alone within doors, after dark.Yet I was still such a blockhead that I missed the lesson of thatfear, and in spite of Weena's distress I insisted upon sleeping awayfrom these slumbering multitudes.'It troubled her greatly, but in the end her odd affection for metriumphed, and for five of the nights of our acquaintance, includingthe last night of all, she slept with her head pillowed on my arm.But my story slips away from me as I speak of her. It must have beenthe night before her rescue that I was awakened about dawn. I hadbeen restless, dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned, andthat sea anemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps.I woke with a start, and with an odd fancy that some greyish animalhad just rushed out of the chamber. I tried to get to sleep again,but I felt restless and uncomfortable. It was that dim grey hourwhen things are just creeping out of darkness, when everything iscolourless and clear cut, and yet unreal. I got up, and went downinto the great hall, and so out upon the flagstones in front of thepalace. I thought I would make a virtue of necessity, and see thesunrise.'The moon was setting, and the dying moonlight and the first pallorof dawn were mingled in a ghastly half-light. The bushes were inkyblack, the ground a sombre grey, the sky colourless and cheerless.And up the hill I thought I could see ghosts. There several times,as I scanned the slope, I saw white figures. Twice I fancied I sawa solitary white, ape-like creature running rather quickly up thehill, and once near the ruins I saw a leash of them carrying somedark body. They moved hastily. I did not see what became of them.It seemed that they vanished among the bushes. The dawn was stillindistinct, you must understand. I was feeling that chill,uncertain, early-morning feeling you may have known. I doubtedmy eyes.'As the eastern sky grew brighter, and the light of the day came onand its vivid colouring returned upon the world once more, I scannedthe view keenly. But I saw no vestige of my white figures. They weremere creatures of the half light. &quot;They must have been ghosts,&quot; Isaid; &quot;I wonder whence they dated.&quot; For a queer notion of GrantAllen's came into my head, and amused me. If each generation die andleave ghosts, he argued, the world at last will get overcrowded withthem. On that theory they would have grown innumerable some EightHundred Thousand Years hence, and it was no great wonder to see fourat once. But the jest was unsatisfying, and I was thinking of thesefigures all the morning, until Weena's rescue drove them out of myhead. I associated them in some indefinite way with the white animalI had startled in my first passionate search for the Time Machine.But Weena was a pleasant substitute. Yet all the same, they weresoon destined to take far deadlier possession of my mind.'I think I have said how much hotter than our own was the weatherof this Golden Age. I cannot account for it. It may be that the sunwas hotter, or the earth nearer the sun. It is usual to assume thatthe sun will go on cooling steadily in the future. But people,unfamiliar with such speculations as those of the younger Darwin,forget that the planets must ultimately fall back one by one intothe parent body. As these catastrophes occur, the sun will blazewith renewed energy; and it may be that some inner planet hadsuffered this fate. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that thesun was very much hotter than we know it.'Well, one very hot morning--my fourth, I think--as I was seekingshelter from the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the greathouse where I slept and fed, there happened this strange thing:Clambering among these heaps of masonry, I found a narrow gallery,whose end and side windows were blocked by fallen masses of stone.By contrast with the brilliancy outside, it seemed at firstimpenetrably dark to me. I entered it groping, for the change fromlight to blackness made spots of colour swim before me. Suddenly Ihalted spellbound. A pair of eyes, luminous by reflection againstthe daylight without, was watching me out of the darkness.'The old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me. I clenchedmy hands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs. I wasafraid to turn. Then the thought of the absolute security in whichhumanity appeared to be living came to my mind. And then Iremembered that strange terror of the dark. Overcoming my fear tosome extent, I advanced a step and spoke. I will admit that myvoice was harsh and ill-controlled. I put out my hand and touchedsomething soft. At once the eyes darted sideways, and somethingwhite ran past me. I turned with my heart in my mouth, and saw aqueer little ape-like figure, its head held down in a peculiarmanner, running across the sunlit space behind me. It blunderedagainst a block of granite, staggered aside, and in a moment washidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of ruined masonry.'My impression of it is, of course, imperfect; but I know it was adull white, and had strange large greyish-red eyes; also that therewas flaxen hair on its head and down its back. But, as I say, itwent too fast for me to see distinctly. I cannot even say whether itran on all-fours, or only with its forearms held very low. After aninstant's pause I followed it into the second heap of ruins. I couldnot find it at first; but, after a time in the profound obscurity, Icame upon one of those round well-like openings of which I have toldyou, half closed by a fallen pillar. A sudden thought came to me.Could this Thing have vanished down the shaft? I lit a match, and,looking down, I saw a small, white, moving creature, with largebright eyes which regarded me steadfastly as it retreated. It mademe shudder. It was so like a human spider! It was clambering downthe wall, and now I saw for the first time a number of metal footand hand rests forming a kind of ladder down the shaft. Then thelight burned my fingers and fell out of my hand, going out as itdropped, and when I had lit another the little monster haddisappeared.'I do not know how long I sat peering down that well. It was not forsome time that I could succeed in persuading myself that the thing Ihad seen was human. But, gradually, the truth dawned on me: thatMan had not remained one species, but had differentiated into twodistinct animals: that my graceful children of the Upper-world werenot the sole descendants of our generation, but that this bleached,obscene, nocturnal Thing, which had flashed before me, was also heirto all the ages.'I thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of anunderground ventilation. I began to suspect their true import. Andwhat, I wondered, was this Lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectlybalanced organization? How was it related to the indolent serenityof the beautiful Upper-worlders? And what was hidden down there,at the foot of that shaft? I sat upon the edge of the well tellingmyself that, at any rate, there was nothing to fear, and that thereI must descend for the solution of my difficulties. And withal Iwas absolutely afraid to go! As I hesitated, two of the beautifulUpper-world people came running in their amorous sport across thedaylight in the shadow. The male pursued the female, flingingflowers at her as he ran.'They seemed distressed to find me, my arm against the overturnedpillar, peering down the well. Apparently it was considered bad formto remark these apertures; for when I pointed to this one, and triedto frame a question about it in their tongue, they were still morevisibly distressed and turned away. But they were interested by mymatches, and I struck some to amuse them. I tried them again aboutthe well, and again I failed. So presently I left them, meaning togo back to Weena, and see what I could get from her. But my mind wasalready in revolution; my guesses and impressions were slipping andsliding to a new adjustment. I had now a clue to the import of thesewells, to the ventilating towers, to the mystery of the ghosts; tosay nothing of a hint at the meaning of the bronze gates and thefate of the Time Machine! And very vaguely there came a suggestiontowards the solution of the economic problem that had puzzled me.'Here was the new view. Plainly, this second species of Man wassubterranean. There were three circumstances in particular whichmade me think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcomeof a long-continued underground habit. In the first place, there wasthe bleached look common in most animals that live largely in thedark--the white fish of the Kentucky caves, for instance. Then,those large eyes, with that capacity for reflecting light, arecommon features of nocturnal things--witness the owl and the cat.And last of all, that evident confusion in the sunshine, that hastyyet fumbling awkward flight towards dark shadow, and that peculiarcarriage of the head while in the light--all reinforced the theoryof an extreme sensitiveness of the retina.'Beneath my feet, then, the earth must be tunnelled enormously, andthese tunnellings were the habitat of the new race. The presence ofventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopes--everywhere, infact, except along the river valley--showed how universal were itsramifications. What so natural, then, as to assume that it was inthis artificial Underworld that such work as was necessary to thecomfort of the daylight race was done? The notion was so plausiblethat I at once accepted it, and went on to assume the _how_ of thissplitting of the human species. I dare say you will anticipate theshape of my theory; though, for myself, I very soon felt that itfell far short of the truth.'At first, proceeding from the problems of our own age, it seemedclear as daylight to me that the gradual widening of the presentmerely temporary and social difference between the Capitalist andthe Labourer, was the key to the whole position. No doubt it willseem grotesque enough to you--and wildly incredible!--and yet evennow there are existing circumstances to point that way. There isa tendency to utilize underground space for the less ornamentalpurposes of civilization; there is the Metropolitan Railway inLondon, for instance, there are new electric railways, there aresubways, there are underground workrooms and restaurants, and theyincrease and multiply. Evidently, I thought, this tendency hadincreased till Industry had gradually lost its birthright in thesky. I mean that it had gone deeper and deeper into larger and everlarger underground factories, spending a still-increasing amount ofits time therein, till, in the end--! Even now, does not an East-endworker live in such artificial conditions as practically to be cutoff from the natural surface of the earth?'Again, the exclusive tendency of richer people--due, no doubt, tothe increasing refinement of their education, and the widening gulfbetween them and the rude violence of the poor--is already leadingto the closing, in their interest, of considerable portions of thesurface of the land. About London, for instance, perhaps half theprettier country is shut in against intrusion. And this samewidening gulf--which is due to the length and expense of the highereducational process and the increased facilities for and temptationstowards refined habits on the part of the rich--will make thatexchange between class and class, that promotion by intermarriagewhich at present retards the splitting of our species along linesof social stratification, less and less frequent. So, in the end,above ground you must have the Haves, pursuing pleasure and comfortand beauty, and below ground the Have-nots, the Workers gettingcontinually adapted to the conditions of their labour. Once theywere there, they would no doubt have to pay rent, and not a littleof it, for the ventilation of their caverns; and if they refused,they would starve or be suffocated for arrears. Such of them as wereso constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would die; and, inthe end, the balance being permanent, the survivors would become aswell adapted to the conditions of underground life, and as happy intheir way, as the Upper-world people were to theirs. As it seemed tome, the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed naturallyenough.'The great triumph of Humanity I had dreamed of took a differentshape in my mind. It had been no such triumph of moral education andgeneral co-operation as I had imagined. Instead, I saw a realaristocracy, armed with a perfected science and working to a logicalconclusion the industrial system of to-day. Its triumph had not beensimply a triumph over Nature, but a triumph over Nature and thefellow-man. This, I must warn you, was my theory at the time. I hadno convenient cicerone in the pattern of the Utopian books. Myexplanation may be absolutely wrong. I still think it is themost plausible one. But even on this supposition the balancedcivilization that was at last attained must have long since passedits zenith, and was now far fallen into decay. The too-perfectsecurity of the Upper-worlders had led them to a slow movement ofdegeneration, to a general dwindling in size, strength, andintelligence. That I could see clearly enough already. What hadhappened to the Under-grounders I did not yet suspect; but from whatI had seen of the Morlocks--that, by the by, was the name by whichthese creatures were called--I could imagine that the modificationof the human type was even far more profound than among the &quot;Eloi,&quot;the beautiful race that I already knew.'Then came troublesome doubts. Why had the Morlocks taken my TimeMachine? For I felt sure it was they who had taken it. Why, too, ifthe Eloi were masters, could they not restore the machine to me? Andwhy were they so terribly afraid of the dark? I proceeded, as I havesaid, to question Weena about this Under-world, but here again I wasdisappointed. At first she would not understand my questions, andpresently she refused to answer them. She shivered as though thetopic was unendurable. And when I pressed her, perhaps a littleharshly, she burst into tears. They were the only tears, except myown, I ever saw in that Golden Age. When I saw them I ceasedabruptly to trouble about the Morlocks, and was only concerned inbanishing these signs of the human inheritance from Weena's eyes.And very soon she was smiling and clapping her hands, while Isolemnly burned a match.VI'It may seem odd to you, but it was two days before I could followup the new-found clue in what was manifestly the proper way. I felta peculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies. They were just thehalf-bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved inspirit in a zoological museum. And they were filthily cold to thetouch. Probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympatheticinfluence of the Eloi, whose disgust of the Morlocks I now beganto appreciate.'The next night I did not sleep well. Probably my health was alittle disordered. I was oppressed with perplexity and doubt. Onceor twice I had a feeling of intense fear for which I could perceiveno definite reason. I remember creeping noiselessly into the greathall where the little people were sleeping in the moonlight--thatnight Weena was among them--and feeling reassured by their presence.It occurred to me even then, that in the course of a few days themoon must pass through its last quarter, and the nights grow dark,when the appearances of these unpleasant creatures from below, thesewhitened Lemurs, this new vermin that had replaced the old, might bemore abundant. And on both these days I had the restless feeling ofone who shirks an inevitable duty. I felt assured that the TimeMachine was only to be recovered by boldly penetrating theseunderground mysteries. Yet I could not face the mystery. If only Ihad had a companion it would have been different. But I was sohorribly alone, and even to clamber down into the darkness of thewell appalled me. I don't know if you will understand my feeling,but I never felt quite safe at my back.'It was this restlessness, this insecurity, perhaps, that drove mefurther and further afield in my exploring expeditions. Going to thesouth-westward towards the rising country that is now called CombeWood, I observed far off, in the direction of nineteenth-centuryBanstead, a vast green structure, different in character from anyI had hitherto seen. It was larger than the largest of the palacesor ruins I knew, and the facade had an Oriental look: the faceof it having the lustre, as well as the pale-green tint, a kindof bluish-green, of a certain type of Chinese porcelain. Thisdifference in aspect suggested a difference in use, and I was mindedto push on and explore. But the day was growing late, and I had comeupon the sight of the place after a long and tiring circuit; so Iresolved to hold over the adventure for the following day, and Ireturned to the welcome and the caresses of little Weena. But nextmorning I perceived clearly enough that my curiosity regarding thePalace of Green Porcelain was a piece of self-deception, to enableme to shirk, by another day, an experience I dreaded. I resolved Iwould make the descent without further waste of time, and startedout in the early morning towards a well near the ruins of graniteand aluminium.'Little Weena ran with me. She danced beside me to the well, butwhen she saw me lean over the mouth and look downward, she seemedstrangely disconcerted. &quot;Good-bye, little Weena,&quot; I said, kissingher; and then putting her down, I began to feel over the parapetfor the climbing hooks. Rather hastily, I may as well confess, forI feared my courage might leak away! At first she watched me inamazement. Then she gave a most piteous cry, and running to me, shebegan to pull at me with her little hands. I think her oppositionnerved me rather to proceed. I shook her off, perhaps a littleroughly, and in another moment I was in the throat of the well. Isaw her agonized face over the parapet, and smiled to reassure her.Then I had to look down at the unstable hooks to which I clung.'I had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards. Thedescent was effected by means of metallic bars projecting fromthe sides of the well, and these being adapted to the needs ofa creature much smaller and lighter than myself, I was speedilycramped and fatigued by the descent. And not simply fatigued! One ofthe bars bent suddenly under my weight, and almost swung me off intothe blackness beneath. For a moment I hung by one hand, and afterthat experience I did not dare to rest again. Though my arms andback were presently acutely painful, I went on clambering down thesheer descent with as quick a motion as possible. Glancing upward,I saw the aperture, a small blue disk, in which a star was visible,while little Weena's head showed as a round black projection. Thethudding sound of a machine below grew louder and more oppressive.Everything save that little disk above was profoundly dark, and whenI looked up again Weena had disappeared.'I was in an agony of discomfort. I had some thought of trying to goup the shaft again, and leave the Under-world alone. But even whileI turned this over in my mind I continued to descend. At last, withintense relief, I saw dimly coming up, a foot to the right of me, aslender loophole in the wall. Swinging myself in, I found it was theaperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which I could lie down andrest. It was not too soon. My arms ached, my back was cramped, and Iwas trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall. Besides this, theunbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes. The airwas full of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air down theshaft.'I do not know how long I lay. I was roused by a soft hand touchingmy face. Starting up in the darkness I snatched at my matches and,hastily striking one, I saw three stooping white creatures similarto the one I had seen above ground in the ruin, hastily retreatingbefore the light. Living, as they did, in what appeared to meimpenetrable darkness, their eyes were abnormally large andsensitive, just as are the pupils of the abysmal fishes, and theyreflected the light in the same way. I have no doubt they could seeme in that rayless obscurity, and they did not seem to have any fearof me apart from the light. But, so soon as I struck a match inorder to see them, they fled incontinently, vanishing into darkgutters and tunnels, from which their eyes glared at me in thestrangest fashion.'I tried to call to them, but the language they had was apparentlydifferent from that of the Over-world people; so that I was needsleft to my own unaided efforts, and the thought of flight beforeexploration was even then in my mind. But I said to myself, &quot;You arein for it now,&quot; and, feeling my way along the tunnel, I found thenoise of machinery grow louder. Presently the walls fell away fromme, and I came to a large open space, and striking another match,saw that I had entered a vast arched cavern, which stretched intoutter darkness beyond the range of my light. The view I had of itwas as much as one could see in the burning of a match.'Necessarily my memory is vague. Great shapes like big machines roseout of the dimness, and cast grotesque black shadows, in which dimspectral Morlocks sheltered from the glare. The place, by the by,was very stuffy and oppressive, and the faint halitus of freshlyshed blood was in the air. Some way down the central vista was alittle table of white metal, laid with what seemed a meal. TheMorlocks at any rate were carnivorous! Even at the time, I rememberwondering what large animal could have survived to furnish the redjoint I saw. It was all very indistinct: the heavy smell, the bigunmeaning shapes, the obscene figures lurking in the shadows, andonly waiting for the darkness to come at me again! Then the matchburned down, and stung my fingers, and fell, a wriggling red spotin the blackness.'I have thought since how particularly ill-equipped I was for suchan experience. When I had started with the Time Machine, I hadstarted with the absurd assumption that the men of the Future wouldcertainly be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances.I had come without arms, without medicine, without anything tosmoke--at times I missed tobacco frightfully--even without enoughmatches. If only I had thought of a Kodak! I could have flashed thatglimpse of the Underworld in a second, and examined it at leisure.But, as it was, I stood there with only the weapons and the powersthat Nature had endowed me with--hands, feet, and teeth; these, andfour safety-matches that still remained to me.'I was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in thedark, and it was only with my last glimpse of light I discoveredthat my store of matches had run low. It had never occurred to meuntil that moment that there was any need to economize them, and Ihad wasted almost half the box in astonishing the Upper-worlders, towhom fire was a novelty. Now, as I say, I had four left, and while Istood in the dark, a hand touched mine, lank fingers came feelingover my face, and I was sensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour. Ifancied I heard the breathing of a crowd of those dreadful littlebeings about me. I felt the box of matches in my hand being gentlydisengaged, and other hands behind me plucking at my clothing. Thesense of these unseen creatures examining me was indescribablyunpleasant. The sudden realization of my ignorance of their ways ofthinking and doing came home to me very vividly in the darkness. Ishouted at them as loudly as I could. They started away, and thenI could feel them approaching me again. They clutched at me moreboldly, whispering odd sounds to each other. I shivered violently,and shouted again--rather discordantly. This time they were not soseriously alarmed, and they made a queer laughing noise as they cameback at me. I will confess I was horribly frightened. I determinedto strike another match and escape under the protection of itsglare. I did so, and eking out the flicker with a scrap of paperfrom my pocket, I made good my retreat to the narrow tunnel. But Ihad scarce entered this when my light was blown out and in theblackness I could hear the Morlocks rustling like wind among leaves,and pattering like the rain, as they hurried after me.'In a moment I was clutched by several hands, and there was nomistaking that they were trying to haul me back. I struck anotherlight, and waved it in their dazzled faces. You can scarce imaginehow nauseatingly inhuman they looked--those pale, chinless facesand great, lidless, pinkish-grey eyes!--as they stared in theirblindness and bewilderment. But I did not stay to look, I promiseyou: I retreated again, and when my second match had ended, I struckmy third. It had almost burned through when I reached the openinginto the shaft. I lay down on the edge, for the throb of the greatpump below made me giddy. Then I felt sideways for the projectinghooks, and, as I did so, my feet were grasped from behind, and Iwas violently tugged backward. I lit my last match ... and itincontinently went out. But I had my hand on the climbing bars now,and, kicking violently, I disengaged myself from the clutches of theMorlocks and was speedily clambering up the shaft, while they stayedpeering and blinking up at me: all but one little wretch whofollowed me for some way, and well-nigh secured my boot as a trophy.'That climb seemed interminable to me. With the last twenty orthirty feet of it a deadly nausea came upon me. I had the greatestdifficulty in keeping my hold. The last few yards was a frightfulstruggle against this faintness. Several times my head swam, and Ifelt all the sensations of falling. At last, however, I got over thewell-mouth somehow, and staggered out of the ruin into the blindingsunlight. I fell upon my face. Even the soil smelt sweet and clean.Then I remember Weena kissing my hands and ears, and the voices ofothers among the Eloi. Then, for a time, I was insensible.VII'Now, indeed, I seemed in a worse case than before. Hitherto,except during my night's anguish at the loss of the Time Machine,I had felt a sustaining hope of ultimate escape, but that hope wasstaggered by these new discoveries. Hitherto I had merely thoughtmyself impeded by the childish simplicity of the little people, andby some unknown forces which I had only to understand to overcome;but there was an altogether new element in the sickening quality ofthe Morlocks--a something inhuman and malign. Instinctively Iloathed them. Before, I had felt as a man might feel who had falleninto a pit: my concern was with the pit and how to get out of it.Now I felt like a beast in a trap, whose enemy would come upon himsoon.'The enemy I dreaded may surprise you. It was the darkness of thenew moon. Weena had put this into my head by some at firstincomprehensible remarks about the Dark Nights. It was not nowsuch a very difficult problem to guess what the coming Dark Nightsmight mean. The moon was on the wane: each night there was a longerinterval of darkness. And I now understood to some slight degree atleast the reason of the fear of the little Upper-world people forthe dark. I wondered vaguely what foul villainy it might be thatthe Morlocks did under the new moon. I felt pretty sure now thatmy second hypothesis was all wrong. The Upper-world people mightonce have been the favoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks theirmechanical servants: but that had long since passed away. The twospecies that had resulted from the evolution of man were slidingdown towards, or had already arrived at, an altogether newrelationship. The Eloi, like the Carolingian kings, had decayedto a mere beautiful futility. They still possessed the earth onsufferance: since the Morlocks, subterranean for innumerablegenerations, had come at last to find the daylit surfaceintolerable. And the Morlocks made their garments, I inferred, andmaintained them in their habitual needs, perhaps through thesurvival of an old habit of service. They did it as a standing horsepaws with his foot, or as a man enjoys killing animals in sport:because ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on theorganism. But, clearly, the old order was already in part reversed.The Nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace. Ages ago,thousands of generations ago, man had thrust his brother man out ofthe ease and the sunshine. And now that brother was coming backchanged! Already the Eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew.They were becoming reacquainted with Fear. And suddenly there cameinto my head the memory of the meat I had seen in the Under-world.It seemed odd how it floated into my mind: not stirred up as itwere by the current of my meditations, but coming in almost like aquestion from outside. I tried to recall the form of it. I had avague sense of something familiar, but I could not tell what it wasat the time.'Still, however helpless the little people in the presence of theirmysterious Fear, I was differently constituted. I came out of thisage of ours, this ripe prime of the human race, when Fear does notparalyse and mystery has lost its terrors. I at least would defendmyself. Without further delay I determined to make myself arms and afastness where I might sleep. With that refuge as a base, I couldface this strange world with some of that confidence I had lost inrealizing to what creatures night by night I lay exposed. I feltI could never sleep again until my bed was secure from them. Ishuddered with horror to think how they must already have examinedme.'I wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the Thames, butfound nothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible. Allthe buildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterousclimbers as the Morlocks, to judge by their wells, must be. Then thetall pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain and the polishedgleam of its walls came back to my memory; and in the evening,taking Weena like a child upon my shoulder, I went up the hillstowards the south-west. The distance, I had reckoned, was seven oreight miles, but it must have been nearer eighteen. I had first seenthe place on a moist afternoon when distances are deceptivelydiminished. In addition, the heel of one of my shoes was loose, anda nail was working through the sole--they were comfortable old shoesI wore about indoors--so that I was lame. And it was already longpast sunset when I came in sight of the palace, silhouetted blackagainst the pale yellow of the sky.'Weena had been hugely delighted when I began to carry her, butafter a while she desired me to let her down, and ran along by theside of me, occasionally darting off on either hand to pick flowersto stick in my pockets. My pockets had always puzzled Weena, but atthe last she had concluded that they were an eccentric kind of vasefor floral decoration. At least she utilized them for that purpose.And that reminds me! In changing my jacket I found...'The Time Traveller paused, put his hand into his pocket, andsilently placed two withered flowers, not unlike very large whitemallows, upon the little table. Then he resumed his narrative.'As the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded overthe hill crest towards Wimbledon, Weena grew tired and wanted toreturn to the house of grey stone. But I pointed out the distantpinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain to her, and contrived tomake her understand that we were seeking a refuge there from herFear. You know that great pause that comes upon things before thedusk? Even the breeze stops in the trees. To me there is always anair of expectation about that evening stillness. The sky was clear,remote, and empty save for a few horizontal bars far down in thesunset. Well, that night the expectation took the colour of myfears. In that darkling calm my senses seemed preternaturallysharpened. I fancied I could even feel the hollowness of the groundbeneath my feet: could, indeed, almost see through it the Morlockson their ant-hill going hither and thither and waiting for the dark.In my excitement I fancied that they would receive my invasion oftheir burrows as a declaration of war. And why had they taken myTime Machine?'So we went on in the quiet, and the twilight deepened into night.The clear blue of the distance faded, and one star after anothercame out. The ground grew dim and the trees black. Weena's fears andher fatigue grew upon her. I took her in my arms and talked to herand caressed her. Then, as the darkness grew deeper, she put herarms round my neck, and, closing her eyes, tightly pressed her faceagainst my shoulder. So we went down a long slope into a valley, andthere in the dimness I almost walked into a little river. This Iwaded, and went up the opposite side of the valley, past a numberof sleeping houses, and by a statue--a Faun, or some such figure,_minus_ the head. Here too were acacias. So far I had seen nothing ofthe Morlocks, but it was yet early in the night, and the darker hoursbefore the old moon rose were still to come.'From the brow of the next hill I saw a thick wood spreading wideand black before me. I hesitated at this. I could see no end toit, either to the right or the left. Feeling tired--my feet, inparticular, were very sore--I carefully lowered Weena from myshoulder as I halted, and sat down upon the turf. I could nolonger see the Palace of Green Porcelain, and I was in doubt of mydirection. I looked into the thickness of the wood and thought ofwhat it might hide. Under that dense tangle of branches one wouldbe out of sight of the stars. Even were there no other lurkingdanger--a danger I did not care to let my imagination looseupon--there would still be all the roots to stumble over and thetree-boles to strike against.'I was very tired, too, after the excitements of the day; so Idecided that I would not face it, but would pass the night upon theopen hill.'Weena, I was glad to find, was fast asleep. I carefully wrapped herin my jacket, and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise. Thehill-side was quiet and deserted, but from the black of the woodthere came now and then a stir of living things. Above me shone thestars, for the night was very clear. I felt a certain sense offriendly comfort in their twinkling. All the old constellationshad gone from the sky, however: that slow movement which isimperceptible in a hundred human lifetimes, had long sincerearranged them in unfamiliar groupings. But the Milky Way, itseemed to me, was still the same tattered streamer of star-dust asof yore. Southward (as I judged it) was a very bright red star thatwas new to me; it was even more splendid than our own green Sirius.And amid all these scintillating points of light one bright planetshone kindly and steadily like the face of an old friend.'Looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and allthe gravities of terrestrial life. I thought of their unfathomabledistance, and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out ofthe unknown past into the unknown future. I thought of the greatprecessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes. Only fortytimes had that silent revolution occurred during all the years thatI had traversed. And during these few revolutions all the activity,all the traditions, the complex organizations, the nations,languages, literatures, aspirations, even the mere memory of Man asI knew him, had been swept out of existence. Instead were thesefrail creatures who had forgotten their high ancestry, and the whiteThings of which I went in terror. Then I thought of the Great Fearthat was between the two species, and for the first time, with asudden shiver, came the clear knowledge of what the meat I had seenmight be. Yet it was too horrible! I looked at little Weena sleepingbeside me, her face white and starlike under the stars, andforthwith dismissed the thought.'Through that long night I held my mind off the Morlocks as well asI could, and whiled away the time by trying to fancy I could findsigns of the old constellations in the new confusion. The sky keptvery clear, except for a hazy cloud or so. No doubt I dozed attimes. Then, as my vigil wore on, came a faintness in the eastwardsky, like the reflection of some colourless fire, and the old moonrose, thin and peaked and white. And close behind, and overtakingit, and overflowing it, the dawn came, pale at first, and thengrowing pink and warm. No Morlocks had approached us. Indeed, I hadseen none upon the hill that night. And in the confidence of renewedday it almost seemed to me that my fear had been unreasonable. Istood up and found my foot with the loose heel swollen at the ankleand painful under the heel; so I sat down again, took off my shoes,and flung them away.'I awakened Weena, and we went down into the wood, now green andpleasant instead of black and forbidding. We found some fruitwherewith to break our fast. We soon met others of the dainty ones,laughing and dancing in the sunlight as though there was no suchthing in nature as the night. And then I thought once more of themeat that I had seen. I felt assured now of what it was, and fromthe bottom of my heart I pitied this last feeble rill from the greatflood of humanity. Clearly, at some time in the Long-Ago of humandecay the Morlocks' food had run short. Possibly they had lived onrats and such-like vermin. Even now man is far less discriminatingand exclusive in his food than he was--far less than any monkey. Hisprejudice against human flesh is no deep-seated instinct. And sothese inhuman sons of men----! I tried to look at the thing in ascientific spirit. After all, they were less human and more remotethan our cannibal ancestors of three or four thousand years ago.And the intelligence that would have made this state of things atorment had gone. Why should I trouble myself? These Eloi were merefatted cattle, which the ant-like Morlocks preserved and preyedupon--probably saw to the breeding of. And there was Weena dancingat my side!'Then I tried to preserve myself from the horror that was comingupon me, by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of humanselfishness. Man had been content to live in ease and delight uponthe labours of his fellow-man, had taken Necessity as his watchwordand excuse, and in the fullness of time Necessity had come home tohim. I even tried a Carlyle-like scorn of this wretched aristocracyin decay. But this attitude of mind was impossible. However greattheir intellectual degradation, the Eloi had kept too much of thehuman form not to claim my sympathy, and to make me perforce asharer in their degradation and their Fear.'I had at that time very vague ideas as to the course I shouldpursue. My first was to secure some safe place of refuge, and tomake myself such arms of metal or stone as I could contrive. Thatnecessity was immediate. In the next place, I hoped to procure somemeans of fire, so that I should have the weapon of a torch at hand,for nothing, I knew, would be more efficient against these Morlocks.Then I wanted to arrange some contrivance to break open the doors ofbronze under the White Sphinx. I had in mind a battering ram. I hada persuasion that if I could enter those doors and carry a blaze oflight before me I should discover the Time Machine and escape. Icould not imagine the Morlocks were strong enough to move it faraway. Weena I had resolved to bring with me to our own time. Andturning such schemes over in my mind I pursued our way towards thebuilding which my fancy had chosen as our dwelling.VIII'I found the Palace of Green Porcelain, when we approached it aboutnoon, deserted and falling into ruin. Only ragged vestiges of glassremained in its windows, and great sheets of the green facing hadfallen away from the corroded metallic framework. It lay very highupon a turfy down, and looking north-eastward before I entered it, Iwas surprised to see a large estuary, or even creek, where I judgedWandsworth and Battersea must once have been. I thought then--thoughI never followed up the thought--of what might have happened, ormight be happening, to the living things in the sea.'The material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeedporcelain, and along the face of it I saw an inscription in someunknown character. I thought, rather foolishly, that Weena mighthelp me to interpret this, but I only learned that the bare idea ofwriting had never entered her head. She always seemed to me, Ifancy, more human than she was, perhaps because her affection was sohuman.'Within the big valves of the door--which were open and broken--wefound, instead of the customary hall, a long gallery lit by manyside windows. At the first glance I was reminded of a museum.The tiled floor was thick with dust, and a remarkable array ofmiscellaneous objects was shrouded in the same grey covering. ThenI perceived, standing strange and gaunt in the centre of the hall,what was clearly the lower part of a huge skeleton. I recognizedby the oblique feet that it was some extinct creature after thefashion of the Megatherium. The skull and the upper bones laybeside it in the thick dust, and in one place, where rain-water haddropped through a leak in the roof, the thing itself had been wornaway. Further in the gallery was the huge skeleton barrel of aBrontosaurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Going towards theside I found what appeared to be sloping shelves, and clearing awaythe thick dust, I found the old familiar glass cases of our owntime. But they must have been air-tight to judge from the fairpreservation of some of their contents.'Clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter-day SouthKensington! Here, apparently, was the Palaeontological Section,and a very splendid array of fossils it must have been, though theinevitable process of decay that had been staved off for a time, andhad, through the extinction of bacteria and fungi, lost ninety-ninehundredths of its force, was nevertheless, with extreme sureness ifwith extreme slowness at work again upon all its treasures. Here andthere I found traces of the little people in the shape of rarefossils broken to pieces or threaded in strings upon reeds. And thecases had in some instances been bodily removed--by the Morlocks asI judged. The place was very silent. The thick dust deadened ourfootsteps. Weena, who had been rolling a sea urchin down the slopingglass of a case, presently came, as I stared about me, and veryquietly took my hand and stood beside me.'And at first I was so much surprised by this ancient monument of anintellectual age, that I gave no thought to the possibilities itpresented. Even my preoccupation about the Time Machine receded alittle from my mind.'To judge from the size of the place, this Palace of Green Porcelainhad a great deal more in it than a Gallery of Palaeontology;possibly historical galleries; it might be, even a library! To me,at least in my present circumstances, these would be vastly moreinteresting than this spectacle of oldtime geology in decay.Exploring, I found another short gallery running transversely to thefirst. This appeared to be devoted to minerals, and the sight of ablock of sulphur set my mind running on gunpowder. But I could findno saltpeter; indeed, no nitrates of any kind. Doubtless they haddeliquesced ages ago. Yet the sulphur hung in my mind, and set up atrain of thinking. As for the rest of the contents of that gallery,though on the whole they were the best preserved of all I saw, I hadlittle interest. I am no specialist in mineralogy, and I went ondown a very ruinous aisle running parallel to the first hall I hadentered. Apparently this section had been devoted to naturalhistory, but everything had long since passed out of recognition. Afew shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had once been stuffedanimals, desiccated mummies in jars that had once held spirit, abrown dust of departed plants: that was all! I was sorry for that,because I should have been glad to trace the patent readjustments bywhich the conquest of animated nature had been attained. Then wecame to a gallery of simply colossal proportions, but singularlyill-lit, the floor of it running downward at a slight angle from theend at which I entered. At intervals white globes hung from theceiling--many of them cracked and smashed--which suggested thatoriginally the place had been artificially lit. Here I was more inmy element, for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks ofbig machines, all greatly corroded and many broken down, but somestill fairly complete. You know I have a certain weakness formechanism, and I was inclined to linger among these; the more so asfor the most part they had the interest of puzzles, and I could makeonly the vaguest guesses at what they were for. I fancied that ifI could solve their puzzles I should find myself in possession ofpowers that might be of use against the Morlocks.'Suddenly Weena came very close to my side. So suddenly that shestartled me. Had it not been for her I do not think I should havenoticed that the floor of the gallery sloped at all. [Footnote: Itmay be, of course, that the floor did not slope, but that the museumwas built into the side of a hill.--ED.] The end I had come in atwas quite above ground, and was lit by rare slit-like windows. Asyou went down the length, the ground came up against these windows,until at last there was a pit like the &quot;area&quot; of a London housebefore each, and only a narrow line of daylight at the top. I wentslowly along, puzzling about the machines, and had been too intentupon them to notice the gradual diminution of the light, untilWeena's increasing apprehensions drew my attention. Then I saw thatthe gallery ran down at last into a thick darkness. I hesitated, andthen, as I looked round me, I saw that the dust was less abundantand its surface less even. Further away towards the dimness, itappeared to be broken by a number of small narrow footprints. Mysense of the immediate presence of the Morlocks revived at that.I felt that I was wasting my time in the academic examination ofmachinery. I called to mind that it was already far advanced in theafternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge, and no meansof making a fire. And then down in the remote blackness of thegallery I heard a peculiar pattering, and the same odd noises I hadheard down the well.'I took Weena's hand. Then, struck with a sudden idea, I left herand turned to a machine from which projected a lever not unlikethose in a signal-box. Clambering upon the stand, and grasping thislever in my hands, I put all my weight upon it sideways. SuddenlyWeena, deserted in the central aisle, began to whimper. I had judgedthe strength of the lever pretty correctly, for it snapped after aminute's strain, and I rejoined her with a mace in my hand more thansufficient, I judged, for any Morlock skull I might encounter. And Ilonged very much to kill a Morlock or so. Very inhuman, you maythink, to want to go killing one's own descendants! But it wasimpossible, somehow, to feel any humanity in the things. Only mydisinclination to leave Weena, and a persuasion that if I began toslake my thirst for murder my Time Machine might suffer, restrainedme from going straight down the gallery and killing the brutes Iheard.'Well, mace in one hand and Weena in the other, I went out of thatgallery and into another and still larger one, which at the firstglance reminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags.The brown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it, Ipresently recognized as the decaying vestiges of books. They hadlong since dropped to pieces, and every semblance of print had leftthem. But here and there were warped boards and cracked metallicclasps that told the tale well enough. Had I been a literary man Imight, perhaps, have moralized upon the futility of all ambition.But as it was, the thing that struck me with keenest force was theenormous waste of labour to which this sombre wilderness of rottingpaper testified. At the time I will confess that I thought chieflyof the _Philosophical Transactions_ and my own seventeen papers uponphysical optics.'Then, going up a broad staircase, we came to what may once havebeen a gallery of technical chemistry. And here I had not a littlehope of useful discoveries. Except at one end where the roof hadcollapsed, this gallery was well preserved. I went eagerly to everyunbroken case. And at last, in one of the really air-tight cases,I found a box of matches. Very eagerly I tried them. They wereperfectly good. They were not even damp. I turned to Weena. &quot;Dance,&quot;I cried to her in her own tongue. For now I had a weapon indeedagainst the horrible creatures we feared. And so, in that derelictmuseum, upon the thick soft carpeting of dust, to Weena's hugedelight, I solemnly performed a kind of composite dance, whistling_The Land of the Leal_ as cheerfully as I could. In part it was amodest _cancan_, in part a step dance, in part a skirt-dance (so faras my tail-coat permitted), and in part original. For I am naturallyinventive, as you know.'Now, I still think that for this box of matches to have escapedthe wear of time for immemorial years was a most strange, as forme it was a most fortunate thing. Yet, oddly enough, I found a farunlikelier substance, and that was camphor. I found it in a sealedjar, that by chance, I suppose, had been really hermetically sealed.I fancied at first that it was paraffin wax, and smashed the glassaccordingly. But the odour of camphor was unmistakable. In theuniversal decay this volatile substance had chanced to survive,perhaps through many thousands of centuries. It reminded me of asepia painting I had once seen done from the ink of a fossilBelemnite that must have perished and become fossilized millionsof years ago. I was about to throw it away, but I remembered thatit was inflammable and burned with a good bright flame--was, infact, an excellent candle--and I put it in my pocket. I found noexplosives, however, nor any means of breaking down the bronzedoors. As yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing I hadchanced upon. Nevertheless I left that gallery greatly elated.'I cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon. It wouldrequire a great effort of memory to recall my explorations in at allthe proper order. I remember a long gallery of rusting stands ofarms, and how I hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or asword. I could not carry both, however, and my bar of iron promisedbest against the bronze gates. There were numbers of guns, pistols,and rifles. The most were masses of rust, but many were of somenew metal, and still fairly sound. But any cartridges or powderthere may once have been had rotted into dust. One corner I saw wascharred and shattered; perhaps, I thought, by an explosion among thespecimens. In another place was a vast array of idols--Polynesian,Mexican, Grecian, Phoenician, every country on earth I should think.And here, yielding to an irresistible impulse, I wrote my name uponthe nose of a steatite monster from South America that particularlytook my fancy.'As the evening drew on, my interest waned. I went through galleryafter gallery, dusty, silent, often ruinous, the exhibits sometimesmere heaps of rust and lignite, sometimes fresher. In one place Isuddenly found myself near the model of a tin-mine, and then by themerest accident I discovered, in an air-tight case, two dynamitecartridges! I shouted &quot;Eureka!&quot; and smashed the case with joy. Thencame a doubt. I hesitated. Then, selecting a little side gallery,I made my essay. I never felt such a disappointment as I did inwaiting five, ten, fifteen minutes for an explosion that never came.Of course the things were dummies, as I might have guessed fromtheir presence. I really believe that had they not been so, I shouldhave rushed off incontinently and blown Sphinx, bronze doors, and(as it proved) my chances of finding the Time Machine, all togetherinto non-existence.'It was after that, I think, that we came to a little open courtwithin the palace. It was turfed, and had three fruit-trees. So werested and refreshed ourselves. Towards sunset I began to considerour position. Night was creeping upon us, and my inaccessiblehiding-place had still to be found. But that troubled me very littlenow. I had in my possession a thing that was, perhaps, the best ofall defences against the Morlocks--I had matches! I had the camphorin my pocket, too, if a blaze were needed. It seemed to me thatthe best thing we could do would be to pass the night in the open,protected by a fire. In the morning there was the getting of theTime Machine. Towards that, as yet, I had only my iron mace. Butnow, with my growing knowledge, I felt very differently towardsthose bronze doors. Up to this, I had refrained from forcing them,largely because of the mystery on the other side. They had neverimpressed me as being very strong, and I hoped to find my bar ofiron not altogether inadequate for the work.IX'We emerged from the palace while the sun was still in part abovethe horizon. I was determined to reach the White Sphinx early thenext morning, and ere the dusk I purposed pushing through the woodsthat had stopped me on the previous journey. My plan was to go asfar as possible that night, and then, building a fire, to sleepin the protection of its glare. Accordingly, as we went along Igathered any sticks or dried grass I saw, and presently had my armsfull of such litter. Thus loaded, our progress was slower than I hadanticipated, and besides Weena was tired. And I began to suffer fromsleepiness too; so that it was full night before we reached thewood. Upon the shrubby hill of its edge Weena would have stopped,fearing the darkness before us; but a singular sense of impendingcalamity, that should indeed have served me as a warning, drove meonward. I had been without sleep for a night and two days, and I wasfeverish and irritable. I felt sleep coming upon me, and theMorlocks with it.'While we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, and dimagainst their blackness, I saw three crouching figures. There wasscrub and long grass all about us, and I did not feel safe fromtheir insidious approach. The forest, I calculated, was ratherless than a mile across. If we could get through it to the barehill-side, there, as it seemed to me, was an altogether saferresting-place; I thought that with my matches and my camphor I couldcontrive to keep my path illuminated through the woods. Yet it wasevident that if I was to flourish matches with my hands I shouldhave to abandon my firewood; so, rather reluctantly, I put it down.And then it came into my head that I would amaze our friends behindby lighting it. I was to discover the atrocious folly of thisproceeding, but it came to my mind as an ingenious move for coveringour retreat.'I don't know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame mustbe in the absence of man and in a temperate climate. The sun'sheat is rarely strong enough to burn, even when it is focused bydewdrops, as is sometimes the case in more tropical districts.Lightning may blast and blacken, but it rarely gives rise towidespread fire. Decaying vegetation may occasionally smoulder withthe heat of its fermentation, but this rarely results in flame. Inthis decadence, too, the art of fire-making had been forgotten onthe earth. The red tongues that went licking up my heap of wood werean altogether new and strange thing to Weena.'She wanted to run to it and play with it. I believe she would havecast herself into it had I not restrained her. But I caught her up,and in spite of her struggles, plunged boldly before me into thewood. For a little way the glare of my fire lit the path. Lookingback presently, I could see, through the crowded stems, that from myheap of sticks the blaze had spread to some bushes adjacent, and acurved line of fire was creeping up the grass of the hill. I laughedat that, and turned again to the dark trees before me. It was veryblack, and Weena clung to me convulsively, but there was still, asmy eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, sufficient light for me toavoid the stems. Overhead it was simply black, except where a gap ofremote blue sky shone down upon us here and there. I struck none ofmy matches because I had no hand free. Upon my left arm I carried mylittle one, in my right hand I had my iron bar.'For some way I heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet,the faint rustle of the breeze above, and my own breathing and thethrob of the blood-vessels in my ears. Then I seemed to know of apattering about me. I pushed on grimly. The pattering grew moredistinct, and then I caught the same queer sound and voices I hadheard in the Under-world. There were evidently several of theMorlocks, and they were closing in upon me. Indeed, in anotherminute I felt a tug at my coat, then something at my arm. And Weenashivered violently, and became quite still.'It was time for a match. But to get one I must put her down. I didso, and, as I fumbled with my pocket, a struggle began in thedarkness about my knees, perfectly silent on her part and with thesame peculiar cooing sounds from the Morlocks. Soft little hands,too, were creeping over my coat and back, touching even my neck.Then the match scratched and fizzed. I held it flaring, and saw thewhite backs of the Morlocks in flight amid the trees. I hastily tooka lump of camphor from my pocket, and prepared to light it as soonas the match should wane. Then I looked at Weena. She was lyingclutching my feet and quite motionless, with her face to the ground.With a sudden fright I stooped to her. She seemed scarcely tobreathe. I lit the block of camphor and flung it to the ground,and as it split and flared up and drove back the Morlocks and theshadows, I knelt down and lifted her. The wood behind seemed full ofthe stir and murmur of a great company!'She seemed to have fainted. I put her carefully upon my shoulderand rose to push on, and then there came a horrible realization. Inmanoeuvring with my matches and Weena, I had turned myself aboutseveral times, and now I had not the faintest idea in what directionlay my path. For all I knew, I might be facing back towards thePalace of Green Porcelain. I found myself in a cold sweat. I had tothink rapidly what to do. I determined to build a fire and encampwhere we were. I put Weena, still motionless, down upon a turfybole, and very hastily, as my first lump of camphor waned, I begancollecting sticks and leaves. Here and there out of the darknessround me the Morlocks' eyes shone like carbuncles.'The camphor flickered and went out. I lit a match, and as I did so,two white forms that had been approaching Weena dashed hastily away.One was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me, and Ifelt his bones grind under the blow of my fist. He gave a whoop ofdismay, staggered a little way, and fell down. I lit another pieceof camphor, and went on gathering my bonfire. Presently I noticedhow dry was some of the foliage above me, for since my arrivalon the Time Machine, a matter of a week, no rain had fallen. So,instead of casting about among the trees for fallen twigs, I beganleaping up and dragging down branches. Very soon I had a chokingsmoky fire of green wood and dry sticks, and could economize mycamphor. Then I turned to where Weena lay beside my iron mace. Itried what I could to revive her, but she lay like one dead. I couldnot even satisfy myself whether or not she breathed.'Now, the smoke of the fire beat over towards me, and it must havemade me heavy of a sudden. Moreover, the vapour of camphor was inthe air. My fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so. Ifelt very weary after my exertion, and sat down. The wood, too, wasfull of a slumbrous murmur that I did not understand. I seemed justto nod and open my eyes. But all was dark, and the Morlocks hadtheir hands upon me. Flinging off their clinging fingers I hastilyfelt in my pocket for the match-box, and--it had gone! Then theygripped and closed with me again. In a moment I knew what hadhappened. I had slept, and my fire had gone out, and the bitternessof death came over my soul. The forest seemed full of the smell ofburning wood. I was caught by the neck, by the hair, by the arms,and pulled down. It was indescribably horrible in the darkness tofeel all these soft creatures heaped upon me. I felt as if I was ina monstrous spider's web. I was overpowered, and went down. I feltlittle teeth nipping at my neck. I rolled over, and as I did so myhand came against my iron lever. It gave me strength. I struggledup, shaking the human rats from me, and, holding the bar short,I thrust where I judged their faces might be. I could feel thesucculent giving of flesh and bone under my blows, and for a momentI was free.'The strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hardfighting came upon me. I knew that both I and Weena were lost, but Idetermined to make the Morlocks pay for their meat. I stood with myback to a tree, swinging the iron bar before me. The whole wood wasfull of the stir and cries of them. A minute passed. Their voicesseemed to rise to a higher pitch of excitement, and their movementsgrew faster. Yet none came within reach. I stood glaring at theblackness. Then suddenly came hope. What if the Morlocks wereafraid? And close on the heels of that came a strange thing. Thedarkness seemed to grow luminous. Very dimly I began to see theMorlocks about me--three battered at my feet--and then I recognized,with incredulous surprise, that the others were running, in anincessant stream, as it seemed, from behind me, and away through thewood in front. And their backs seemed no longer white, but reddish.As I stood agape, I saw a little red spark go drifting across a gapof starlight between the branches, and vanish. And at that Iunderstood the smell of burning wood, the slumbrous murmur that wasgrowing now into a gusty roar, the red glow, and the Morlocks'flight.'Stepping out from behind my tree and looking back, I saw, throughthe black pillars of the nearer trees, the flames of the burningforest. It was my first fire coming after me. With that I looked forWeena, but she was gone. The hissing and crackling behind me, theexplosive thud as each fresh tree burst into flame, left littletime for reflection. My iron bar still gripped, I followed in theMorlocks' path. It was a close race. Once the flames crept forwardso swiftly on my right as I ran that I was outflanked and had tostrike off to the left. But at last I emerged upon a small openspace, and as I did so, a Morlock came blundering towards me, andpast me, and went on straight into the fire!'And now I was to see the most weird and horrible thing, I think, ofall that I beheld in that future age. This whole space was as brightas day with the reflection of the fire. In the centre was a hillockor tumulus, surmounted by a scorched hawthorn. Beyond this wasanother arm of the burning forest, with yellow tongues alreadywrithing from it, completely encircling the space with a fence offire. Upon the hill-side were some thirty or forty Morlocks, dazzledby the light and heat, and blundering hither and thither againsteach other in their bewilderment. At first I did not realize theirblindness, and struck furiously at them with my bar, in a frenzy offear, as they approached me, killing one and crippling several more.But when I had watched the gestures of one of them groping under thehawthorn against the red sky, and heard their moans, I was assuredof their absolute helplessness and misery in the glare, and I struckno more of them.'Yet every now and then one would come straight towards me, settingloose a quivering horror that made me quick to elude him. At onetime the flames died down somewhat, and I feared the foul creatureswould presently be able to see me. I was thinking of beginning thefight by killing some of them before this should happen; but thefire burst out again brightly, and I stayed my hand. I walked aboutthe hill among them and avoided them, looking for some trace ofWeena. But Weena was gone.'At last I sat down on the summit of the hillock, and watched thisstrange incredible company of blind things groping to and fro, andmaking uncanny noises to each other, as the glare of the fire beaton them. The coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky, andthrough the rare tatters of that red canopy, remote as though theybelonged to another universe, shone the little stars. Two or threeMorlocks came blundering into me, and I drove them off with blowsof my fists, trembling as I did so.'For the most part of that night I was persuaded it was a nightmare.I bit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake. I beatthe ground with my hands, and got up and sat down again, andwandered here and there, and again sat down. Then I would fall torubbing my eyes and calling upon God to let me awake. Thrice I sawMorlocks put their heads down in a kind of agony and rush into theflames. But, at last, above the subsiding red of the fire, above thestreaming masses of black smoke and the whitening and blackeningtree stumps, and the diminishing numbers of these dim creatures,came the white light of the day.'I searched again for traces of Weena, but there were none. It wasplain that they had left her poor little body in the forest. Icannot describe how it relieved me to think that it had escaped theawful fate to which it seemed destined. As I thought of that, I wasalmost moved to begin a massacre of the helpless abominations aboutme, but I contained myself. The hillock, as I have said, was a kindof island in the forest. From its summit I could now make outthrough a haze of smoke the Palace of Green Porcelain, and from thatI could get my bearings for the White Sphinx. And so, leaving theremnant of these damned souls still going hither and thither andmoaning, as the day grew clearer, I tied some grass about my feetand limped on across smoking ashes and among black stems, that stillpulsated internally with fire, towards the hiding-place of the TimeMachine. I walked slowly, for I was almost exhausted, as well aslame, and I felt the intensest wretchedness for the horrible deathof little Weena. It seemed an overwhelming calamity. Now, in thisold familiar room, it is more like the sorrow of a dream than anactual loss. But that morning it left me absolutely lonelyagain--terribly alone. I began to think of this house of mine, ofthis fireside, of some of you, and with such thoughts came a longingthat was pain.'But as I walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morningsky, I made a discovery. In my trouser pocket were still some loosematches. The box must have leaked before it was lost.X'About eight or nine in the morning I came to the same seat ofyellow metal from which I had viewed the world upon the evening ofmy arrival. I thought of my hasty conclusions upon that evening andcould not refrain from laughing bitterly at my confidence. Herewas the same beautiful scene, the same abundant foliage, the samesplendid palaces and magnificent ruins, the same silver riverrunning between its fertile banks. The gay robes of the beautifulpeople moved hither and thither among the trees. Some were bathingin exactly the place where I had saved Weena, and that suddenly gaveme a keen stab of pain. And like blots upon the landscape rose thecupolas above the ways to the Under-world. I understood now what allthe beauty of the Over-world people covered. Very pleasant was theirday, as pleasant as the day of the cattle in the field. Like thecattle, they knew of no enemies and provided against no needs. Andtheir end was the same.'I grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect hadbeen. It had committed suicide. It had set itself steadfastlytowards comfort and ease, a balanced society with security andpermanency as its watchword, it had attained its hopes--to cometo this at last. Once, life and property must have reached almostabsolute safety. The rich had been assured of his wealth andcomfort, the toiler assured of his life and work. No doubt in thatperfect world there had been no unemployed problem, no socialquestion left unsolved. And a great quiet had followed.'It is a law of nature we overlook, that intellectual versatilityis the compensation for change, danger, and trouble. An animalperfectly in harmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism.Nature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct areuseless. There is no intelligence where there is no change and noneed of change. Only those animals partake of intelligence that haveto meet a huge variety of needs and dangers.'So, as I see it, the Upper-world man had drifted towards hisfeeble prettiness, and the Under-world to mere mechanical industry.But that perfect state had lacked one thing even for mechanicalperfection--absolute permanency. Apparently as time went on, thefeeding of the Under-world, however it was effected, had becomedisjointed. Mother Necessity, who had been staved off for afew thousand years, came back again, and she began below. TheUnder-world being in contact with machinery, which, however perfect,still needs some little thought outside habit, had probably retainedperforce rather more initiative, if less of every other humancharacter, than the Upper. And when other meat failed them, theyturned to what old habit had hitherto forbidden. So I say I saw itin my last view of the world of Eight Hundred and Two Thousand SevenHundred and One. It may be as wrong an explanation as mortal witcould invent. It is how the thing shaped itself to me, and as that Igive it to you.'After the fatigues, excitements, and terrors of the past days, andin spite of my grief, this seat and the tranquil view and the warmsunlight were very pleasant. I was very tired and sleepy, and soonmy theorizing passed into dozing. Catching myself at that, I took myown hint, and spreading myself out upon the turf I had a long andrefreshing sleep.'I awoke a little before sunsetting. I now felt safe against beingcaught napping by the Morlocks, and, stretching myself, I came ondown the hill towards the White Sphinx. I had my crowbar in onehand, and the other hand played with the matches in my pocket.'And now came a most unexpected thing. As I approached the pedestalof the sphinx I found the bronze valves were open. They had sliddown into grooves.'At that I stopped short before them, hesitating to enter.'Within was a small apartment, and on a raised place in the cornerof this was the Time Machine. I had the small levers in my pocket.So here, after all my elaborate preparations for the siege of theWhite Sphinx, was a meek surrender. I threw my iron bar away, almostsorry not to use it.'A sudden thought came into my head as I stooped towards the portal.For once, at least, I grasped the mental operations of the Morlocks.Suppressing a strong inclination to laugh, I stepped through thebronze frame and up to the Time Machine. I was surprised to find ithad been carefully oiled and cleaned. I have suspected since thatthe Morlocks had even partially taken it to pieces while trying intheir dim way to grasp its purpose.'Now as I stood and examined it, finding a pleasure in the meretouch of the contrivance, the thing I had expected happened. Thebronze panels suddenly slid up and struck the frame with a clang.I was in the dark--trapped. So the Morlocks thought. At that Ichuckled gleefully.'I could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came towardsme. Very calmly I tried to strike the match. I had only to fix onthe levers and depart then like a ghost. But I had overlooked onelittle thing. The matches were of that abominable kind that lightonly on the box.'You may imagine how all my calm vanished. The little brutes wereclose upon me. One touched me. I made a sweeping blow in the dark atthem with the levers, and began to scramble into the saddle of themachine. Then came one hand upon me and then another. Then I hadsimply to fight against their persistent fingers for my levers, andat the same time feel for the studs over which these fitted. One,indeed, they almost got away from me. As it slipped from my hand,I had to butt in the dark with my head--I could hear the Morlock'sskull ring--to recover it. It was a nearer thing than the fight inthe forest, I think, this last scramble.'But at last the lever was fitted and pulled over. The clinginghands slipped from me. The darkness presently fell from my eyes.I found myself in the same grey light and tumult I have alreadydescribed.XI'I have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comeswith time travelling. And this time I was not seated properly in thesaddle, but sideways and in an unstable fashion. For an indefinitetime I clung to the machine as it swayed and vibrated, quiteunheeding how I went, and when I brought myself to look at the dialsagain I was amazed to find where I had arrived. One dial recordsdays, and another thousands of days, another millions of days, andanother thousands of millions. Now, instead of reversing the levers,I had pulled them over so as to go forward with them, and when Icame to look at these indicators I found that the thousands hand wassweeping round as fast as the seconds hand of a watch--intofuturity.'As I drove on, a peculiar change crept over the appearance ofthings. The palpitating greyness grew darker; then--though I wasstill travelling with prodigious velocity--the blinking successionof day and night, which was usually indicative of a slower pace,returned, and grew more and more marked. This puzzled me very muchat first. The alternations of night and day grew slower and slower,and so did the passage of the sun across the sky, until they seemedto stretch through centuries. At last a steady twilight brooded overthe earth, a twilight only broken now and then when a comet glaredacross the darkling sky. The band of light that had indicated thesun had long since disappeared; for the sun had ceased to set--itsimply rose and fell in the west, and grew ever broader and morered. All trace of the moon had vanished. The circling of the stars,growing slower and slower, had given place to creeping points oflight. At last, some time before I stopped, the sun, red and verylarge, halted motionless upon the horizon, a vast dome glowing witha dull heat, and now and then suffering a momentary extinction. Atone time it had for a little while glowed more brilliantly again,but it speedily reverted to its sullen red heat. I perceived by thisslowing down of its rising and setting that the work of the tidaldrag was done. The earth had come to rest with one face to the sun,even as in our own time the moon faces the earth. Very cautiously,for I remembered my former headlong fall, I began to reversemy motion. Slower and slower went the circling hands until thethousands one seemed motionless and the daily one was no longer amere mist upon its scale. Still slower, until the dim outlines of adesolate beach grew visible.'I stopped very gently and sat upon the Time Machine, looking round.The sky was no longer blue. North-eastward it was inky black,and out of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the palewhite stars. Overhead it was a deep Indian red and starless, andsouth-eastward it grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where, cut bythe horizon, lay the huge hull of the sun, red and motionless. Therocks about me were of a harsh reddish colour, and all the trace oflife that I could see at first was the intensely green vegetationthat covered every projecting point on their south-eastern face. Itwas the same rich green that one sees on forest moss or on thelichen in caves: plants which like these grow in a perpetualtwilight.'The machine was standing on a sloping beach. The sea stretched awayto the south-west, to rise into a sharp bright horizon against thewan sky. There were no breakers and no waves, for not a breath ofwind was stirring. Only a slight oily swell rose and fell like agentle breathing, and showed that the eternal sea was still movingand living. And along the margin where the water sometimes broke wasa thick incrustation of salt--pink under the lurid sky. There was asense of oppression in my head, and I noticed that I was breathingvery fast. The sensation reminded me of my only experience ofmountaineering, and from that I judged the air to be more rarefiedthan it is now.'Far away up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream, and saw athing like a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up intothe sky and, circling, disappear over some low hillocks beyond. Thesound of its voice was so dismal that I shivered and seated myselfmore firmly upon the machine. Looking round me again, I saw that,quite near, what I had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was movingslowly towards me. Then I saw the thing was really a monstrouscrab-like creature. Can you imagine a crab as large as yonder table,with its many legs moving slowly and uncertainly, its big clawsswaying, its long antennae, like carters' whips, waving and feeling,and its stalked eyes gleaming at you on either side of its metallicfront? Its back was corrugated and ornamented with ungainly bosses,and a greenish incrustation blotched it here and there. I could seethe many palps of its complicated mouth flickering and feeling as itmoved.'As I stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me, I felta tickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there. I tried tobrush it away with my hand, but in a moment it returned, and almostimmediately came another by my ear. I struck at this, and caughtsomething threadlike. It was drawn swiftly out of my hand. With afrightful qualm, I turned, and I saw that I had grasped the antennaof another monster crab that stood just behind me. Its evil eyeswere wriggling on their stalks, its mouth was all alive withappetite, and its vast ungainly claws, smeared with an algal slime,were descending upon me. In a moment my hand was on the lever, andI had placed a month between myself and these monsters. But I wasstill on the same beach, and I saw them distinctly now as soon as Istopped. Dozens of them seemed to be crawling here and there, in thesombre light, among the foliated sheets of intense green.'I cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung overthe world. The red eastern sky, the northward blackness, the saltDead Sea, the stony beach crawling with these foul, slow-stirringmonsters, the uniform poisonous-looking green of the lichenousplants, the thin air that hurts one's lungs: all contributed to anappalling effect. I moved on a hundred years, and there was the samered sun--a little larger, a little duller--the same dying sea, thesame chill air, and the same crowd of earthy crustacea creeping inand out among the green weed and the red rocks. And in the westwardsky, I saw a curved pale line like a vast new moon.'So I travelled, stopping ever and again, in great strides of athousand years or more, drawn on by the mystery of the earth's fate,watching with a strange fascination the sun grow larger and dullerin the westward sky, and the life of the old earth ebb away. Atlast, more than thirty million years hence, the huge red-hot dome ofthe sun had come to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darklingheavens. Then I stopped once more, for the crawling multitude ofcrabs had disappeared, and the red beach, save for its livid greenliverworts and lichens, seemed lifeless. And now it was flecked withwhite. A bitter cold assailed me. Rare white flakes ever and againcame eddying down. To the north-eastward, the glare of snow layunder the starlight of the sable sky and I could see an undulatingcrest of hillocks pinkish white. There were fringes of ice along thesea margin, with drifting masses further out; but the main expanseof that salt ocean, all bloody under the eternal sunset, was stillunfrozen.'I looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained. Acertain indefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of themachine. But I saw nothing moving, in earth or sky or sea. The greenslime on the rocks alone testified that life was not extinct. Ashallow sandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had recededfrom the beach. I fancied I saw some black object flopping aboutupon this bank, but it became motionless as I looked at it, and Ijudged that my eye had been deceived, and that the black object wasmerely a rock. The stars in the sky were intensely bright and seemedto me to twinkle very little.'Suddenly I noticed that the circular westward outline of the sunhad changed; that a concavity, a bay, had appeared in the curve. Isaw this grow larger. For a minute perhaps I stared aghast at thisblackness that was creeping over the day, and then I realized thatan eclipse was beginning. Either the moon or the planet Mercury waspassing across the sun's disk. Naturally, at first I took it to bethe moon, but there is much to incline me to believe that what Ireally saw was the transit of an inner planet passing very near tothe earth.'The darkness grew apace; a cold wind began to blow in fresheninggusts from the east, and the showering white flakes in the airincreased in number. From the edge of the sea came a ripple andwhisper. Beyond these lifeless sounds the world was silent. Silent?It would be hard to convey the stillness of it. All the sounds ofman, the bleating of sheep, the cries of birds, the hum of insects,the stir that makes the background of our lives--all that was over.As the darkness thickened, the eddying flakes grew more abundant,dancing before my eyes; and the cold of the air more intense. Atlast, one by one, swiftly, one after the other, the white peaks ofthe distant hills vanished into blackness. The breeze rose to amoaning wind. I saw the black central shadow of the eclipse sweepingtowards me. In another moment the pale stars alone were visible. Allelse was rayless obscurity. The sky was absolutely black.'A horror of this great darkness came on me. The cold, that smoteto my marrow, and the pain I felt in breathing, overcame me. Ishivered, and a deadly nausea seized me. Then like a red-hot bowin the sky appeared the edge of the sun. I got off the machine torecover myself. I felt giddy and incapable of facing the returnjourney. As I stood sick and confused I saw again the moving thingupon the shoal--there was no mistake now that it was a movingthing--against the red water of the sea. It was a round thing, thesize of a football perhaps, or, it may be, bigger, and tentaclestrailed down from it; it seemed black against the welteringblood-red water, and it was hopping fitfully about. Then I felt Iwas fainting. But a terrible dread of lying helpless in that remoteand awful twilight sustained me while I clambered upon the saddle.XII'So I came back. For a long time I must have been insensible uponthe machine. The blinking succession of the days and nights wasresumed, the sun got golden again, the sky blue. I breathed withgreater freedom. The fluctuating contours of the land ebbed andflowed. The hands spun backward upon the dials. At last I saw againthe dim shadows of houses, the evidences of decadent humanity.These, too, changed and passed, and others came. Presently, when themillion dial was at zero, I slackened speed. I began to recognizeour own pretty and familiar architecture, the thousands hand ran backto the starting-point, the night and day flapped slower and slower.Then the old walls of the laboratory came round me. Very gently,now, I slowed the mechanism down.'I saw one little thing that seemed odd to me. I think I have toldyou that when I set out, before my velocity became very high, Mrs.Watchett had walked across the room, travelling, as it seemed to me,like a rocket. As I returned, I passed again across that minute whenshe traversed the laboratory. But now her every motion appeared tobe the exact inversion of her previous ones. The door at the lowerend opened, and she glided quietly up the laboratory, back foremost,and disappeared behind the door by which she had previously entered.Just before that I seemed to see Hillyer for a moment; but he passedlike a flash.'Then I stopped the machine, and saw about me again the old familiarlaboratory, my tools, my appliances just as I had left them. I gotoff the thing very shakily, and sat down upon my bench. For severalminutes I trembled violently. Then I became calmer. Around me wasmy old workshop again, exactly as it had been. I might have sleptthere, and the whole thing have been a dream.'And yet, not exactly! The thing had started from the south-eastcorner of the laboratory. It had come to rest again in thenorth-west, against the wall where you saw it. That gives you theexact distance from my little lawn to the pedestal of the WhiteSphinx, into which the Morlocks had carried my machine.'For a time my brain went stagnant. Presently I got up and camethrough the passage here, limping, because my heel was stillpainful, and feeling sorely begrimed. I saw the _Pall Mall Gazette_on the table by the door. I found the date was indeed to-day, andlooking at the timepiece, saw the hour was almost eight o'clock. Iheard your voices and the clatter of plates. I hesitated--I felt sosick and weak. Then I sniffed good wholesome meat, and opened thedoor on you. You know the rest. I washed, and dined, and now I amtelling you the story.'I know,' he said, after a pause, 'that all this will be absolutelyincredible to you. To me the one incredible thing is that I am hereto-night in this old familiar room looking into your friendly facesand telling you these strange adventures.'He looked at the Medical Man. 'No. I cannot expect you to believeit. Take it as a lie--or a prophecy. Say I dreamed it in theworkshop. Consider I have been speculating upon the destinies of ourrace until I have hatched this fiction. Treat my assertion of itstruth as a mere stroke of art to enhance its interest. And takingit as a story, what do you think of it?'He took up his pipe, and began, in his old accustomed manner, to tapwith it nervously upon the bars of the grate. There was a momentarystillness. Then chairs began to creak and shoes to scrape upon thecarpet. I took my eyes off the Time Traveller's face, and lookedround at his audience. They were in the dark, and little spots ofcolour swam before them. The Medical Man seemed absorbed in thecontemplation of our host. The Editor was looking hard at the endof his cigar--the sixth. The Journalist fumbled for his watch. Theothers, as far as I remember, were motionless.The Editor stood up with a sigh. 'What a pity it is you're nota writer of stories!' he said, putting his hand on the TimeTraveller's shoulder.'You don't believe it?''Well----''I thought not.'The Time Traveller turned to us. 'Where are the matches?' he said.He lit one and spoke over his pipe, puffing. 'To tell you the truth... I hardly believe it myself.... And yet...'His eye fell with a mute inquiry upon the withered white flowersupon the little table. Then he turned over the hand holding hispipe, and I saw he was looking at some half-healed scars on hisknuckles.The Medical Man rose, came to the lamp, and examined the flowers.'The gynaeceum's odd,' he said. The Psychologist leant forward tosee, holding out his hand for a specimen.'I'm hanged if it isn't a quarter to one,' said the Journalist.'How shall we get home?''Plenty of cabs at the station,' said the Psychologist.'It's a curious thing,' said the Medical Man; 'but I certainly don'tknow the natural order of these flowers. May I have them?'The Time Traveller hesitated. Then suddenly: 'Certainly not.''Where did you really get them?' said the Medical Man.The Time Traveller put his hand to his head. He spoke like one whowas trying to keep hold of an idea that eluded him. 'They were putinto my pocket by Weena, when I travelled into Time.' He staredround the room. 'I'm damned if it isn't all going. This room and youand the atmosphere of every day is too much for my memory. Did Iever make a Time Machine, or a model of a Time Machine? Or is it allonly a dream? They say life is a dream, a precious poor dream attimes--but I can't stand another that won't fit. It's madness. Andwhere did the dream come from? ... I must look at that machine. Ifthere is one!'He caught up the lamp swiftly, and carried it, flaring red, throughthe door into the corridor. We followed him. There in the flickeringlight of the lamp was the machine sure enough, squat, ugly, andaskew; a thing of brass, ebony, ivory, and translucent glimmeringquartz. Solid to the touch--for I put out my hand and felt the railof it--and with brown spots and smears upon the ivory, and bits ofgrass and moss upon the lower parts, and one rail bent awry.The Time Traveller put the lamp down on the bench, and ran his handalong the damaged rail. 'It's all right now,' he said. 'The story Itold you was true. I'm sorry to have brought you out here in thecold.' He took up the lamp, and, in an absolute silence, wereturned to the smoking-room.He came into the hall with us and helped the Editor on with hiscoat. The Medical Man looked into his face and, with a certainhesitation, told him he was suffering from overwork, at which helaughed hugely. I remember him standing in the open doorway, bawlinggood night.I shared a cab with the Editor. He thought the tale a 'gaudy lie.'For my own part I was unable to come to a conclusion. The story wasso fantastic and incredible, the telling so credible and sober. Ilay awake most of the night thinking about it. I determined to gonext day and see the Time Traveller again. I was told he was in thelaboratory, and being on easy terms in the house, I went up to him.The laboratory, however, was empty. I stared for a minute at theTime Machine and put out my hand and touched the lever. At that thesquat substantial-looking mass swayed like a bough shaken by thewind. Its instability startled me extremely, and I had a queerreminiscence of the childish days when I used to be forbidden tomeddle. I came back through the corridor. The Time Traveller met mein the smoking-room. He was coming from the house. He had a smallcamera under one arm and a knapsack under the other. He laughed whenhe saw me, and gave me an elbow to shake. 'I'm frightfully busy,'said he, 'with that thing in there.''But is it not some hoax?' I said. 'Do you really travel throughtime?''Really and truly I do.' And he looked frankly into my eyes. Hehesitated. His eye wandered about the room. 'I only want half anhour,' he said. 'I know why you came, and it's awfully good of you.There's some magazines here. If you'll stop to lunch I'll prove youthis time travelling up to the hilt, specimen and all. If you'llforgive my leaving you now?'I consented, hardly comprehending then the full import of his words,and he nodded and went on down the corridor. I heard the door ofthe laboratory slam, seated myself in a chair, and took up a dailypaper. What was he going to do before lunch-time? Then suddenlyI was reminded by an advertisement that I had promised to meetRichardson, the publisher, at two. I looked at my watch, and sawthat I could barely save that engagement. I got up and went down thepassage to tell the Time Traveller.As I took hold of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation,oddly truncated at the end, and a click and a thud. A gust of airwhirled round me as I opened the door, and from within came thesound of broken glass falling on the floor. The Time Traveller wasnot there. I seemed to see a ghostly, indistinct figure sitting ina whirling mass of black and brass for a moment--a figure sotransparent that the bench behind with its sheets of drawings wasabsolutely distinct; but this phantasm vanished as I rubbed my eyes.The Time Machine had gone. Save for a subsiding stir of dust, thefurther end of the laboratory was empty. A pane of the skylight had,apparently, just been blown in.I felt an unreasonable amazement. I knew that something strange hadhappened, and for the moment could not distinguish what the strangething might be. As I stood staring, the door into the garden opened,and the man-servant appeared.We looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. 'Has Mr. ----gone out that way?' said I.'No, sir. No one has come out this way. I was expecting to find himhere.'At that I understood. At the risk of disappointing Richardson Istayed on, waiting for the Time Traveller; waiting for the second,perhaps still stranger story, and the specimens and photographs hewould bring with him. But I am beginning now to fear that I mustwait a lifetime. The Time Traveller vanished three years ago. And,as everybody knows now, he has never returned.EPILOGUEOne cannot choose but wonder. Will he ever return? It may be that heswept back into the past, and fell among the blood-drinking, hairysavages of the Age of Unpolished Stone; into the abysses of theCretaceous Sea; or among the grotesque saurians, the huge reptilianbrutes of the Jurassic times. He may even now--if I may use thephrase--be wandering on some plesiosaurus-haunted Oolitic coralreef, or beside the lonely saline lakes of the Triassic Age. Or didhe go forward, into one of the nearer ages, in which men are stillmen, but with the riddles of our own time answered and its wearisomeproblems solved? Into the manhood of the race: for I, for my ownpart, cannot think that these latter days of weak experiment,fragmentary theory, and mutual discord are indeed man's culminatingtime! I say, for my own part. He, I know--for the question had beendiscussed among us long before the Time Machine was made--thoughtbut cheerlessly of the Advancement of Mankind, and saw in thegrowing pile of civilization only a foolish heaping that mustinevitably fall back upon and destroy its makers in the end. If thatis so, it remains for us to live as though it were not so. But to methe future is still black and blank--is a vast ignorance, lit at afew casual places by the memory of his story. And I have by me, formy comfort, two strange white flowers--shrivelled now, and brown andflat and brittle--to witness that even when mind and strength hadgone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived on in the heartof man.End of Project Gutenberg's The Time Machine, by H.

I was then a child of but five years, yet I well remember thetall, dark, smooth-faced, athletic man whom I called Uncle Jack.He seemed always to be laughing; and he entered into the sports of thechildren with the same hearty good fellowship he displayed toward thosepastimes in which the men and women of his own age indulged; or hewould sit for an hour at a time entertaining my old grandmother withstories of his strange, wild life in all parts of the world.  We allloved him, and our slaves fairly worshipped the ground he trod.He was a splendid specimen of manhood, standing a good two inches oversix feet, broad of shoulder and narrow of hip, with the carriage of thetrained fighting man.  His features were regular and clear cut, hishair black and closely cropped, while his eyes were of a steel gray,reflecting a strong and loyal character, filled with fire andinitiative.  His manners were perfect, and his courtliness was that ofa typical southern gentleman of the highest type.His horsemanship, especially after hounds, was a marvel and delighteven in that country of magnificent horsemen.  I have often heard myfather caution him against his wild recklessness, but he would onlylaugh, and say that the tumble that killed him would be from the backof a horse yet unfoaled.When the war broke out he left us, nor did I see him again for somefifteen or sixteen years.  When he returned it was without warning, andI was much surprised to note that he had not aged apparently a moment,nor had he changed in any other outward way.  He was, when others werewith him, the same genial, happy fellow we had known of old, but whenhe thought himself alone I have seen him sit for hours gazing off intospace, his face set in a look of wistful longing and hopeless misery;and at night he would sit thus looking up into the heavens, at what Idid not know until I read his manuscript years afterward.He told us that he had been prospecting and mining in Arizona part ofthe time since the war; and that he had been very successful wasevidenced by the unlimited amount of money with which he was supplied.As to the details of his life during these years he was very reticent,in fact he would not talk of them at all.He remained with us for about a year and then went to New York, wherehe purchased a little place on the Hudson, where I visited him once ayear on the occasions of my trips to the New York market--my father andI owning and operating a string of general stores throughout Virginiaat that time.  Captain Carter had a small but beautiful cottage,situated on a bluff overlooking the river, and during one of my lastvisits, in the winter of 1885, I observed he was much occupied inwriting, I presume now, upon this manuscript.He told me at this time that if anything should happen to him he wishedme to take charge of his estate, and he gave me a key to a compartmentin the safe which stood in his study, telling me I would find his willthere and some personal instructions which he had me pledge myself tocarry out with absolute fidelity.After I had retired for the night I have seen him from my windowstanding in the moonlight on the brink of the bluff overlooking theHudson with his arms stretched out to the heavens as though in appeal.I thought at the time that he was praying, although I never understoodthat he was in the strict sense of the term a religious man.Several months after I had returned home from my last visit, the firstof March, 1886, I think, I received a telegram from him asking me tocome to him at once.  I had always been his favorite among the youngergeneration of Carters and so I hastened to comply with his demand.I arrived at the little station, about a mile from his grounds, on themorning of March 4, 1886, and when I asked the livery man to drive meout to Captain Carter's he replied that if I was a friend of theCaptain's he had some very bad news for me; the Captain had been founddead shortly after daylight that very morning by the watchman attachedto an adjoining property.For some reason this news did not surprise me, but I hurried out to hisplace as quickly as possible, so that I could take charge of the bodyand of his affairs.I found the watchman who had discovered him, together with the localpolice chief and several townspeople, assembled in his little study.The watchman related the few details connected with the finding of thebody, which he said had been still warm when he came upon it.  It lay,he said, stretched full length in the snow with the arms outstretchedabove the head toward the edge of the bluff, and when he showed me thespot it flashed upon me that it was the identical one where I had seenhim on those other nights, with his arms raised in supplication to theskies.There were no marks of violence on the body, and with the aid of alocal physician the coroner's jury quickly reached a decision of deathfrom heart failure.  Left alone in the study, I opened the safe andwithdrew the contents of the drawer in which he had told me I wouldfind my instructions.  They were in part peculiar indeed, but I havefollowed them to each last detail as faithfully as I was able.He directed that I remove his body to Virginia without embalming, andthat he be laid in an open coffin within a tomb which he previously hadhad constructed and which, as I later learned, was well ventilated.The instructions impressed upon me that I must personally see that thiswas carried out just as he directed, even in secrecy if necessary.His property was left in such a way that I was to receive the entireincome for twenty-five years, when the principal was to become mine.His further instructions related to this manuscript which I was toretain sealed and unread, just as I found it, for eleven years; nor wasI to divulge its contents until twenty-one years after his death.A strange feature about the tomb, where his body still lies, is thatthe massive door is equipped with a single, huge gold-plated springlock which can be opened _only from the inside_.Yours very sincerely,Edgar Rice Burroughs.CONTENTS      I  On the Arizona Hills     II  The Escape of the Dead    III  My Advent on Mars     IV  A Prisoner      V  I Elude My Watch Dog     VI  A Fight That Won Friends    VII  Child-Raising on Mars   VIII  A Fair Captive from the Sky     IX  I Learn the Language      X  Champion and Chief     XI  With Dejah Thoris    XII  A Prisoner with Power   XIII  Love-Making on Mars    XIV  A Duel to the Death     XV  Sola Tells Me Her Story    XVI  We Plan Escape   XVII  A Costly Recapture  XVIII  Chained in Warhoon    XIX  Battling in the Arena     XX  In the Atmosphere Factory    XXI  An Air Scout for Zodanga   XXII  I Find Dejah  XXIII  Lost in the Sky   XXIV  Tars Tarkas Finds a Friend    XXV  The Looting of Zodanga   XXVI  Through Carnage to Joy  XXVII  From Joy to Death XXVIII  At the Arizona CaveILLUSTRATIONSWith my back against a golden throne,  I fought once again for Dejah Thoris . . . . . . _Frontispiece_I sought out Dejah Thoris in the throng of departing chariots.She drew upon the marble floor the first map of the  Barsoomian territory I had ever seen.The old man sat and talked with me for hours.CHAPTER ION THE ARIZONA HILLSI am a very old man; how old I do not know.  Possibly I am a hundred,possibly more; but I cannot tell because I have never aged as othermen, nor do I remember any childhood.  So far as I can recollect I havealways been a man, a man of about thirty.  I appear today as I didforty years and more ago, and yet I feel that I cannot go on livingforever; that some day I shall die the real death from which there isno resurrection.  I do not know why I should fear death, I who havedied twice and am still alive; but yet I have the same horror of it asyou who have never died, and it is because of this terror of death, Ibelieve, that I am so convinced of my mortality.And because of this conviction I have determined to write down thestory of the interesting periods of my life and of my death.  I cannotexplain the phenomena; I can only set down here in the words of anordinary soldier of fortune a chronicle of the strange events thatbefell me during the ten years that my dead body lay undiscovered in anArizona cave.I have never told this story, nor shall mortal man see this manuscriptuntil after I have passed over for eternity.  I know that the averagehuman mind will not believe what it cannot grasp, and so I do notpurpose being pilloried by the public, the pulpit, and the press, andheld up as a colossal liar when I am but telling the simple truthswhich some day science will substantiate.  Possibly the suggestionswhich I gained upon Mars, and the knowledge which I can set down inthis chronicle, will aid in an earlier understanding of the mysteriesof our sister planet; mysteries to you, but no longer mysteries to me.My name is John Carter; I am better known as Captain Jack Carter ofVirginia.  At the close of the Civil War I found myself possessed ofseveral hundred thousand dollars (Confederate) and a captain'scommission in the cavalry arm of an army which no longer existed; theservant of a state which had vanished with the hopes of the South.Masterless, penniless, and with my only means of livelihood, fighting,gone, I determined to work my way to the southwest and attempt toretrieve my fallen fortunes in a search for gold.I spent nearly a year prospecting in company with another Confederateofficer, Captain James K. Powell of Richmond.  We were extremelyfortunate, for late in the winter of 1865, after many hardships andprivations, we located the most remarkable gold-bearing quartz veinthat our wildest dreams had ever pictured.  Powell, who was a miningengineer by education, stated that we had uncovered over a milliondollars worth of ore in a trifle over three months.As our equipment was crude in the extreme we decided that one of usmust return to civilization, purchase the necessary machinery andreturn with a sufficient force of men properly to work the mine.As Powell was familiar with the country, as well as with the mechanicalrequirements of mining we determined that it would be best for him tomake the trip.  It was agreed that I was to hold down our claim againstthe remote possibility of its being jumped by some wandering prospector.On March 3, 1866, Powell and I packed his provisions on two of ourburros, and bidding me good-bye he mounted his horse, and started downthe mountainside toward the valley, across which led the first stage ofhis journey.The morning of Powell's departure was, like nearly all Arizonamornings, clear and beautiful; I could see him and his little packanimals picking their way down the mountainside toward the valley, andall during the morning I would catch occasional glimpses of them asthey topped a hog back or came out upon a level plateau.  My last sightof Powell was about three in the afternoon as he entered the shadows ofthe range on the opposite side of the valley.Some half hour later I happened to glance casually across the valleyand was much surprised to note three little dots in about the sameplace I had last seen my friend and his two pack animals.  I am notgiven to needless worrying, but the more I tried to convince myselfthat all was well with Powell, and that the dots I had seen on histrail were antelope or wild horses, the less I was able to assuremyself.Since we had entered the territory we had not seen a hostile Indian,and we had, therefore, become careless in the extreme, and were wont toridicule the stories we had heard of the great numbers of these viciousmarauders that were supposed to haunt the trails, taking their toll inlives and torture of every white party which fell into their mercilessclutches.Powell, I knew, was well armed and, further, an experienced Indianfighter; but I too had lived and fought for years among the Sioux inthe North, and I knew that his chances were small against a party ofcunning trailing Apaches.  Finally I could endure the suspense nolonger, and, arming myself with my two Colt revolvers and a carbine, Istrapped two belts of cartridges about me and catching my saddle horse,started down the trail taken by Powell in the morning.As soon as I reached comparatively level ground I urged my mount into acanter and continued this, where the going permitted, until, close upondusk, I discovered the point where other tracks joined those of Powell.They were the tracks of unshod ponies, three of them, and the ponieshad been galloping.I followed rapidly until, darkness shutting down, I was forced to awaitthe rising of the moon, and given an opportunity to speculate on thequestion of the wisdom of my chase.  Possibly I had conjured upimpossible dangers, like some nervous old housewife, and when I shouldcatch up with Powell would get a good laugh for my pains.  However, Iam not prone to sensitiveness, and the following of a sense of duty,wherever it may lead, has always been a kind of fetich with methroughout my life; which may account for the honors bestowed upon meby three republics and the decorations and friendships of an old andpowerful emperor and several lesser kings, in whose service my swordhas been red many a time.About nine o'clock the moon was sufficiently bright for me to proceedon my way and I had no difficulty in following the trail at a fastwalk, and in some places at a brisk trot until, about midnight, Ireached the water hole where Powell had expected to camp.  I came uponthe spot unexpectedly, finding it entirely deserted, with no signs ofhaving been recently occupied as a camp.I was interested to note that the tracks of the pursuing horsemen, forsuch I was now convinced they must be, continued after Powell with onlya brief stop at the hole for water; and always at the same rate ofspeed as his.I was positive now that the trailers were Apaches and that they wishedto capture Powell alive for the fiendish pleasure of the torture, so Iurged my horse onward at a most dangerous pace, hoping against hopethat I would catch up with the red rascals before they attacked him.Further speculation was suddenly cut short by the faint report of twoshots far ahead of me.  I knew that Powell would need me now if ever,and I instantly urged my horse to his topmost speed up the narrow anddifficult mountain trail.I had forged ahead for perhaps a mile or more without hearing furthersounds, when the trail suddenly debouched onto a small, open plateaunear the summit of the pass.  I had passed through a narrow,overhanging gorge just before entering suddenly upon this table land,and the sight which met my eyes filled me with consternation and dismay.The little stretch of level land was white with Indian tepees, andthere were probably half a thousand red warriors clustered around someobject near the center of the camp.  Their attention was so whollyriveted to this point of interest that they did not notice me, and Ieasily could have turned back into the dark recesses of the gorge andmade my escape with perfect safety.  The fact, however, that thisthought did not occur to me until the following day removes anypossible right to a claim to heroism to which the narration of thisepisode might possibly otherwise entitle me.I do not believe that I am made of the stuff which constitutes heroes,because, in all of the hundreds of instances that my voluntary actshave placed me face to face with death, I cannot recall a single onewhere any alternative step to that I took occurred to me until manyhours later.  My mind is evidently so constituted that I amsubconsciously forced into the path of duty without recourse totiresome mental processes.  However that may be, I have never regrettedthat cowardice is not optional with me.In this instance I was, of course, positive that Powell was the centerof attraction, but whether I thought or acted first I do not know, butwithin an instant from the moment the scene broke upon my view I hadwhipped out my revolvers and was charging down upon the entire army ofwarriors, shooting rapidly, and whooping at the top of my lungs.Singlehanded, I could not have pursued better tactics, for the red men,convinced by sudden surprise that not less than a regiment of regularswas upon them, turned and fled in every direction for their bows,arrows, and rifles.The view which their hurried routing disclosed filled me withapprehension and with rage.  Under the clear rays of the Arizona moonlay Powell, his body fairly bristling with the hostile arrows of thebraves.  That he was already dead I could not but be convinced, and yetI would have saved his body from mutilation at the hands of the Apachesas quickly as I would have saved the man himself from death.Riding close to him I reached down from the saddle, and grasping hiscartridge belt drew him up across the withers of my mount.  A backwardglance convinced me that to return by the way I had come would be morehazardous than to continue across the plateau, so, putting spurs to mypoor beast, I made a dash for the opening to the pass which I coulddistinguish on the far side of the table land.The Indians had by this time discovered that I was alone and I waspursued with imprecations, arrows, and rifle balls.  The fact that itis difficult to aim anything but imprecations accurately by moonlight,that they were upset by the sudden and unexpected manner of my advent,and that I was a rather rapidly moving target saved me from the variousdeadly projectiles of the enemy and permitted me to reach the shadowsof the surrounding peaks before an orderly pursuit could be organized.My horse was traveling practically unguided as I knew that I hadprobably less knowledge of the exact location of the trail to the passthan he, and thus it happened that he entered a defile which led to thesummit of the range and not to the pass which I had hoped would carryme to the valley and to safety.  It is probable, however, that to thisfact I owe my life and the remarkable experiences and adventures whichbefell me during the following ten years.My first knowledge that I was on the wrong trail came when I heard theyells of the pursuing savages suddenly grow fainter and fainter far offto my left.I knew then that they had passed to the left of the jagged rockformation at the edge of the plateau, to the right of which my horsehad borne me and the body of Powell.I drew rein on a little level promontory overlooking the trail belowand to my left, and saw the party of pursuing savages disappearingaround the point of a neighboring peak.I knew the Indians would soon discover that they were on the wrongtrail and that the search for me would be renewed in the rightdirection as soon as they located my tracks.I had gone but a short distance further when what seemed to be anexcellent trail opened up around the face of a high cliff.  The trailwas level and quite broad and led upward and in the general direction Iwished to go.  The cliff arose for several hundred feet on my right,and on my left was an equal and nearly perpendicular drop to the bottomof a rocky ravine.I had followed this trail for perhaps a hundred yards when a sharp turnto the right brought me to the mouth of a large cave.  The opening wasabout four feet in height and three to four feet wide, and at thisopening the trail ended.It was now morning, and, with the customary lack of dawn which is astartling characteristic of Arizona, it had become daylight almostwithout warning.Dismounting, I laid Powell upon the ground, but the most painstakingexamination failed to reveal the faintest spark of life.  I forcedwater from my canteen between his dead lips, bathed his face and rubbedhis hands, working over him continuously for the better part of an hourin the face of the fact that I knew him to be dead.I was very fond of Powell; he was thoroughly a man in every respect; apolished southern gentleman; a staunch and true friend; and it was witha feeling of the deepest grief that I finally gave up my crudeendeavors at resuscitation.Leaving Powell's body where it lay on the ledge I crept into the caveto reconnoiter.  I found a large chamber, possibly a hundred feet indiameter and thirty or forty feet in height; a smooth and well-wornfloor, and many other evidences that the cave had, at some remoteperiod, been inhabited.  The back of the cave was so lost in denseshadow that I could not distinguish whether there were openings intoother apartments or not.As I was continuing my examination I commenced to feel a pleasantdrowsiness creeping over me which I attributed to the fatigue of mylong and strenuous ride, and the reaction from the excitement of thefight and the pursuit.  I felt comparatively safe in my presentlocation as I knew that one man could defend the trail to the caveagainst an army.I soon became so drowsy that I could scarcely resist the strong desireto throw myself on the floor of the cave for a few moments' rest, but Iknew that this would never do, as it would mean certain death at thehands of my red friends, who might be upon me at any moment.  With aneffort I started toward the opening of the cave only to reel drunkenlyagainst a side wall, and from there slip prone upon the floor.CHAPTER IITHE ESCAPE OF THE DEADA sense of delicious dreaminess overcame me, my muscles relaxed, and Iwas on the point of giving way to my desire to sleep when the sound ofapproaching horses reached my ears.  I attempted to spring to my feetbut was horrified to discover that my muscles refused to respond to mywill.  I was now thoroughly awake, but as unable to move a muscle asthough turned to stone.  It was then, for the first time, that Inoticed a slight vapor filling the cave.  It was extremely tenuous andonly noticeable against the opening which led to daylight.  There alsocame to my nostrils a faintly pungent odor, and I could only assumethat I had been overcome by some poisonous gas, but why I should retainmy mental faculties and yet be unable to move I could not fathom.I lay facing the opening of the cave and where I could see the shortstretch of trail which lay between the cave and the turn of the cliffaround which the trail led.  The noise of the approaching horses hadceased, and I judged the Indians were creeping stealthily upon me alongthe little ledge which led to my living tomb.  I remember that I hopedthey would make short work of me as I did not particularly relish thethought of the innumerable things they might do to me if the spiritprompted them.I had not long to wait before a stealthy sound apprised me of theirnearness, and then a war-bonneted, paint-streaked face was thrustcautiously around the shoulder of the cliff, and savage eyes lookedinto mine.  That he could see me in the dim light of the cave I wassure for the early morning sun was falling full upon me through theopening.The fellow, instead of approaching, merely stood and stared; his eyesbulging and his jaw dropped.  And then another savage face appeared,and a third and fourth and fifth, craning their necks over theshoulders of their fellows whom they could not pass upon the narrowledge.  Each face was the picture of awe and fear, but for what reasonI did not know, nor did I learn until ten years later.  That there werestill other braves behind those who regarded me was apparent from thefact that the leaders passed back whispered word to those behind them.Suddenly a low but distinct moaning sound issued from the recesses ofthe cave behind me, and, as it reached the ears of the Indians, theyturned and fled in terror, panic-stricken.  So frantic were theirefforts to escape from the unseen thing behind me that one of thebraves was hurled headlong from the cliff to the rocks below.  Theirwild cries echoed in the canyon for a short time, and then all wasstill once more.The sound which had frightened them was not repeated, but it had beensufficient as it was to start me speculating on the possible horrorwhich lurked in the shadows at my back.  Fear is a relative term and soI can only measure my feelings at that time by what I had experiencedin previous positions of danger and by those that I have passed throughsince; but I can say without shame that if the sensations I enduredduring the next few minutes were fear, then may God help the coward,for cowardice is of a surety its own punishment.To be held paralyzed, with one's back toward some horrible and unknowndanger from the very sound of which the ferocious Apache warriors turnin wild stampede, as a flock of sheep would madly flee from a pack ofwolves, seems to me the last word in fearsome predicaments for a manwho had ever been used to fighting for his life with all the energy ofa powerful physique.Several times I thought I heard faint sounds behind me as of somebodymoving cautiously, but eventually even these ceased, and I was left tothe contemplation of my position without interruption.  I could butvaguely conjecture the cause of my paralysis, and my only hope lay inthat it might pass off as suddenly as it had fallen upon me.Late in the afternoon my horse, which had been standing with draggingrein before the cave, started slowly down the trail, evidently insearch of food and water, and I was left alone with my mysteriousunknown companion and the dead body of my friend, which lay just withinmy range of vision upon the ledge where I had placed it in the earlymorning.From then until possibly midnight all was silence, the silence of thedead; then, suddenly, the awful moan of the morning broke upon mystartled ears, and there came again from the black shadows the sound ofa moving thing, and a faint rustling as of dead leaves.  The shock tomy already overstrained nervous system was terrible in the extreme, andwith a superhuman effort I strove to break my awful bonds.  It was aneffort of the mind, of the will, of the nerves; not muscular, for Icould not move even so much as my little finger, but none the lessmighty for all that.  And then something gave, there was a momentaryfeeling of nausea, a sharp click as of the snapping of a steel wire,and I stood with my back against the wall of the cave facing my unknownfoe.And then the moonlight flooded the cave, and there before me lay my ownbody as it had been lying all these hours, with the eyes staring towardthe open ledge and the hands resting limply upon the ground.  I lookedfirst at my lifeless clay there upon the floor of the cave and thendown at myself in utter bewilderment; for there I lay clothed, and yethere I stood but naked as at the minute of my birth.The transition had been so sudden and so unexpected that it left me fora moment forgetful of aught else than my strange metamorphosis.  Myfirst thought was, is this then death!  Have I indeed passed overforever into that other life!  But I could not well believe this, as Icould feel my heart pounding against my ribs from the exertion of myefforts to release myself from the anaesthesis which had held me.  Mybreath was coming in quick, short gasps, cold sweat stood out fromevery pore of my body, and the ancient experiment of pinching revealedthe fact that I was anything other than a wraith.Again was I suddenly recalled to my immediate surroundings by arepetition of the weird moan from the depths of the cave.  Naked andunarmed as I was, I had no desire to face the unseen thing whichmenaced me.My revolvers were strapped to my lifeless body which, for someunfathomable reason, I could not bring myself to touch.  My carbine wasin its boot, strapped to my saddle, and as my horse had wandered off Iwas left without means of defense.  My only alternative seemed to liein flight and my decision was crystallized by a recurrence of therustling sound from the thing which now seemed, in the darkness of thecave and to my distorted imagination, to be creeping stealthily upon me.Unable longer to resist the temptation to escape this horrible place Ileaped quickly through the opening into the starlight of a clearArizona night.  The crisp, fresh mountain air outside the cave acted asan immediate tonic and I felt new life and new courage coursing throughme.  Pausing upon the brink of the ledge I upbraided myself for whatnow seemed to me wholly unwarranted apprehension.  I reasoned withmyself that I had lain helpless for many hours within the cave, yetnothing had molested me, and my better judgment, when permitted thedirection of clear and logical reasoning, convinced me that the noisesI had heard must have resulted from purely natural and harmless causes;probably the conformation of the cave was such that a slight breeze hadcaused the sounds I heard.I decided to investigate, but first I lifted my head to fill my lungswith the pure, invigorating night air of the mountains.  As I did so Isaw stretching far below me the beautiful vista of rocky gorge, andlevel, cacti-studded flat, wrought by the moonlight into a miracle ofsoft splendor and wondrous enchantment.Few western wonders are more inspiring than the beauties of an Arizonamoonlit landscape; the silvered mountains in the distance, the strangelights and shadows upon hog back and arroyo, and the grotesque detailsof the stiff, yet beautiful cacti form a picture at once enchanting andinspiring; as though one were catching for the first time a glimpse ofsome dead and forgotten world, so different is it from the aspect ofany other spot upon our earth.As I stood thus meditating, I turned my gaze from the landscape to theheavens where the myriad stars formed a gorgeous and fitting canopy forthe wonders of the earthly scene.  My attention was quickly riveted bya large red star close to the distant horizon.  As I gazed upon it Ifelt a spell of overpowering fascination--it was Mars, the god of war,and for me, the fighting man, it had always held the power ofirresistible enchantment.  As I gazed at it on that far-gone night itseemed to call across the unthinkable void, to lure me to it, to drawme as the lodestone attracts a particle of iron.My longing was beyond the power of opposition; I closed my eyes,stretched out my arms toward the god of my vocation and felt myselfdrawn with the suddenness of thought through the trackless immensity ofspace.  There was an instant of extreme cold and utter darkness.CHAPTER IIIMY ADVENT ON MARSI opened my eyes upon a strange and weird landscape.  I knew that I wason Mars; not once did I question either my sanity or my wakefulness.  Iwas not asleep, no need for pinching here; my inner consciousness toldme as plainly that I was upon Mars as your conscious mind tells youthat you are upon Earth.  You do not question the fact; neither did I.I found myself lying prone upon a bed of yellowish, mosslike vegetationwhich stretched around me in all directions for interminable miles.  Iseemed to be lying in a deep, circular basin, along the outer verge ofwhich I could distinguish the irregularities of low hills.It was midday, the sun was shining full upon me and the heat of it wasrather intense upon my naked body, yet no greater than would have beentrue under similar conditions on an Arizona desert.  Here and therewere slight outcroppings of quartz-bearing rock which glistened in thesunlight; and a little to my left, perhaps a hundred yards, appeared alow, walled enclosure about four feet in height.  No water, and noother vegetation than the moss was in evidence, and as I was somewhatthirsty I determined to do a little exploring.Springing to my feet I received my first Martian surprise, for theeffort, which on Earth would have brought me standing upright, carriedme into the Martian air to the height of about three yards.  I alightedsoftly upon the ground, however, without appreciable shock or jar.  Nowcommenced a series of evolutions which even then seemed ludicrous inthe extreme.  I found that I must learn to walk all over again, as themuscular exertion which carried me easily and safely upon Earth playedstrange antics with me upon Mars.Instead of progressing in a sane and dignified manner, my attempts towalk resulted in a variety of hops which took me clear of the ground acouple of feet at each step and landed me sprawling upon my face orback at the end of each second or third hop.  My muscles, perfectlyattuned and accustomed to the force of gravity on Earth, played themischief with me in attempting for the first time to cope with thelesser gravitation and lower air pressure on Mars.I was determined, however, to explore the low structure which was theonly evidence of habitation in sight, and so I hit upon the unique planof reverting to first principles in locomotion, creeping.  I did fairlywell at this and in a few moments had reached the low, encircling wallof the enclosure.There appeared to be no doors or windows upon the side nearest me, butas the wall was but about four feet high I cautiously gained my feetand peered over the top upon the strangest sight it had ever been givenme to see.The roof of the enclosure was of solid glass about four or five inchesin thickness, and beneath this were several hundred large eggs,perfectly round and snowy white.  The eggs were nearly uniform in sizebeing about two and one-half feet in diameter.Five or six had already hatched and the grotesque caricatures which satblinking in the sunlight were enough to cause me to doubt my sanity.They seemed mostly head, with little scrawny bodies, long necks and sixlegs, or, as I afterward learned, two legs and two arms, with anintermediary pair of limbs which could be used at will either as armsor legs.  Their eyes were set at the extreme sides of their heads atrifle above the center and protruded in such a manner that they couldbe directed either forward or back and also independently of eachother, thus permitting this queer animal to look in any direction, orin two directions at once, without the necessity of turning the head.The ears, which were slightly above the eyes and closer together, weresmall, cup-shaped antennae, protruding not more than an inch on theseyoung specimens.  Their noses were but longitudinal slits in the centerof their faces, midway between their mouths and ears.There was no hair on their bodies, which were of a very lightyellowish-green color.  In the adults, as I was to learn quite soon,this color deepens to an olive green and is darker in the male than inthe female.  Further, the heads of the adults are not so out ofproportion to their bodies as in the case of the young.The iris of the eyes is blood red, as in Albinos, while the pupil isdark.  The eyeball itself is very white, as are the teeth.  Theselatter add a most ferocious appearance to an otherwise fearsome andterrible countenance, as the lower tusks curve upward to sharp pointswhich end about where the eyes of earthly human beings are located.The whiteness of the teeth is not that of ivory, but of the snowiestand most gleaming of china.  Against the dark background of their oliveskins their tusks stand out in a most striking manner, making theseweapons present a singularly formidable appearance.Most of these details I noted later, for I was given but little time tospeculate on the wonders of my new discovery.  I had seen that the eggswere in the process of hatching, and as I stood watching the hideouslittle monsters break from their shells I failed to note the approachof a score of full-grown Martians from behind me.Coming, as they did, over the soft and soundless moss, which coverspractically the entire surface of Mars with the exception of the frozenareas at the poles and the scattered cultivated districts, they mighthave captured me easily, but their intentions were far more sinister.It was the rattling of the accouterments of the foremost warrior whichwarned me.On such a little thing my life hung that I often marvel that I escapedso easily.  Had not the rifle of the leader of the party swung from itsfastenings beside his saddle in such a way as to strike against thebutt of his great metal-shod spear I should have snuffed out withoutever knowing that death was near me.  But the little sound caused me toturn, and there upon me, not ten feet from my breast, was the point ofthat huge spear, a spear forty feet long, tipped with gleaming metal,and held low at the side of a mounted replica of the little devils Ihad been watching.But how puny and harmless they now looked beside this huge and terrificincarnation of hate, of vengeance and of death.  The man himself, forsuch I may call him, was fully fifteen feet in height and, on Earth,would have weighed some four hundred pounds.  He sat his mount as wesit a horse, grasping the animal's barrel with his lower limbs, whilethe hands of his two right arms held his immense spear low at the sideof his mount; his two left arms were outstretched laterally to helppreserve his balance, the thing he rode having neither bridle or reinsof any description for guidance.And his mount!  How can earthly words describe it!  It towered ten feetat the shoulder; had four legs on either side; a broad flat tail,larger at the tip than at the root, and which it held straight outbehind while running; a gaping mouth which split its head from itssnout to its long, massive neck.Like its master, it was entirely devoid of hair, but was of a darkslate color and exceeding smooth and glossy.  Its belly was white, andits legs shaded from the slate of its shoulders and hips to a vividyellow at the feet.  The feet themselves were heavily padded andnailless, which fact had also contributed to the noiselessness of theirapproach, and, in common with a multiplicity of legs, is acharacteristic feature of the fauna of Mars.  The highest type of manand one other animal, the only mammal existing on Mars, alone havewell-formed nails, and there are absolutely no hoofed animals inexistence there.Behind this first charging demon trailed nineteen others, similar inall respects, but, as I learned later, bearing individualcharacteristics peculiar to themselves; precisely as no two of us areidentical although we are all cast in a similar mold.  This picture, orrather materialized nightmare, which I have described at length, madebut one terrible and swift impression on me as I turned to meet it.Unarmed and naked as I was, the first law of nature manifested itselfin the only possible solution of my immediate problem, and that was toget out of the vicinity of the point of the charging spear.Consequently I gave a very earthly and at the same time superhuman leapto reach the top of the Martian incubator, for such I had determined itmust be.My effort was crowned with a success which appalled me no less than itseemed to surprise the Martian warriors, for it carried me fully thirtyfeet into the air and landed me a hundred feet from my pursuers and onthe opposite side of the enclosure.I alighted upon the soft moss easily and without mishap, and turningsaw my enemies lined up along the further wall.  Some were surveying mewith expressions which I afterward discovered marked extremeastonishment, and the others were evidently satisfying themselves thatI had not molested their young.They were conversing together in low tones, and gesticulating andpointing toward me.  Their discovery that I had not harmed the littleMartians, and that I was unarmed, must have caused them to look upon mewith less ferocity; but, as I was to learn later, the thing whichweighed most in my favor was my exhibition of hurdling.While the Martians are immense, their bones are very large and they aremuscled only in proportion to the gravitation which they must overcome.The result is that they are infinitely less agile and less powerful, inproportion to their weight, than an Earth man, and I doubt that wereone of them suddenly to be transported to Earth he could lift his ownweight from the ground; in fact, I am convinced that he could not do so.My feat then was as marvelous upon Mars as it would have been uponEarth, and from desiring to annihilate me they suddenly looked upon meas a wonderful discovery to be captured and exhibited among theirfellows.The respite my unexpected agility had given me permitted me toformulate plans for the immediate future and to note more closely theappearance of the warriors, for I could not disassociate these peoplein my mind from those other warriors who, only the day before, had beenpursuing me.I noted that each was armed with several other weapons in addition tothe huge spear which I have described.  The weapon which caused me todecide against an attempt at escape by flight was what was evidently arifle of some description, and which I felt, for some reason, they werepeculiarly efficient in handling.These rifles were of a white metal stocked with wood, which I learnedlater was a very light and intensely hard growth much prized on Mars,and entirely unknown to us denizens of Earth.  The metal of the barrelis an alloy composed principally of aluminum and steel which they havelearned to temper to a hardness far exceeding that of the steel withwhich we are familiar.  The weight of these rifles is comparativelylittle, and with the small caliber, explosive, radium projectiles whichthey use, and the great length of the barrel, they are deadly in theextreme and at ranges which would be unthinkable on Earth.  Thetheoretic effective radius of this rifle is three hundred miles, butthe best they can do in actual service when equipped with theirwireless finders and sighters is but a trifle over two hundred miles.This is quite far enough to imbue me with great respect for the Martianfirearm, and some telepathic force must have warned me against anattempt to escape in broad daylight from under the muzzles of twenty ofthese death-dealing machines.The Martians, after conversing for a short time, turned and rode awayin the direction from which they had come, leaving one of their numberalone by the enclosure.  When they had covered perhaps two hundredyards they halted, and turning their mounts toward us sat watching thewarrior by the enclosure.He was the one whose spear had so nearly transfixed me, and wasevidently the leader of the band, as I had noted that they seemed tohave moved to their present position at his direction.  When his forcehad come to a halt he dismounted, threw down his spear and small arms,and came around the end of the incubator toward me, entirely unarmedand as naked as I, except for the ornaments strapped upon his head,limbs, and breast.When he was within about fifty feet of me he unclasped an enormousmetal armlet, and holding it toward me in the open palm of his hand,addressed me in a clear, resonant voice, but in a language, it isneedless to say, I could not understand.  He then stopped as thoughwaiting for my reply, pricking up his antennae-like ears and cockinghis strange-looking eyes still further toward me.As the silence became painful I concluded to hazard a littleconversation on my own part, as I had guessed that he was makingovertures of peace.  The throwing down of his weapons and thewithdrawing of his troop before his advance toward me would havesignified a peaceful mission anywhere on Earth, so why not, then, onMars!Placing my hand over my heart I bowed low to the Martian and explainedto him that while I did not understand his language, his actions spokefor the peace and friendship that at the present moment were most dearto my heart.  Of course I might have been a babbling brook for all theintelligence my speech carried to him, but he understood the actionwith which I immediately followed my words.Stretching my hand toward him, I advanced and took the armlet from hisopen palm, clasping it about my arm above the elbow; smiled at him andstood waiting.  His wide mouth spread into an answering smile, andlocking one of his intermediary arms in mine we turned and walked backtoward his mount.  At the same time he motioned his followers toadvance.  They started toward us on a wild run, but were checked by asignal from him.  Evidently he feared that were I to be reallyfrightened again I might jump entirely out of the landscape.He exchanged a few words with his men, motioned to me that I would ridebehind one of them, and then mounted his own animal.  The fellowdesignated reached down two or three hands and lifted me up behind himon the glossy back of his mount, where I hung on as best I could by thebelts and straps which held the Martian's weapons and ornaments.The entire cavalcade then turned and galloped away toward the range ofhills in the distance.CHAPTER IVA PRISONERWe had gone perhaps ten miles when the ground began to rise veryrapidly.  We were, as I was later to learn, nearing the edge of one ofMars' long-dead seas, in the bottom of which my encounter with theMartians had taken place.In a short time we gained the foot of the mountains, and aftertraversing a narrow gorge came to an open valley, at the far extremityof which was a low table land upon which I beheld an enormous city.Toward this we galloped, entering it by what appeared to be a ruinedroadway leading out from the city, but only to the edge of the tableland, where it ended abruptly in a flight of broad steps.Upon closer observation I saw as we passed them that the buildings weredeserted, and while not greatly decayed had the appearance of nothaving been tenanted for years, possibly for ages.  Toward the centerof the city was a large plaza, and upon this and in the buildingsimmediately surrounding it were camped some nine or ten hundredcreatures of the same breed as my captors, for such I now consideredthem despite the suave manner in which I had been trapped.With the exception of their ornaments all were naked.  The women variedin appearance but little from the men, except that their tusks weremuch larger in proportion to their height, in some instances curvingnearly to their high-set ears.  Their bodies were smaller and lighterin color, and their fingers and toes bore the rudiments of nails, whichwere entirely lacking among the males.  The adult females ranged inheight from ten to twelve feet.The children were light in color, even lighter than the women, and alllooked precisely alike to me, except that some were taller than others;older, I presumed.I saw no signs of extreme age among them, nor is there any appreciabledifference in their appearance from the age of maturity, about forty,until, at about the age of one thousand years, they go voluntarily upontheir last strange pilgrimage down the river Iss, which leads no livingMartian knows whither and from whose bosom no Martian has everreturned, or would be allowed to live did he return after onceembarking upon its cold, dark waters.Only about one Martian in a thousand dies of sickness or disease, andpossibly about twenty take the voluntary pilgrimage.  The other ninehundred and seventy-nine die violent deaths in duels, in hunting, inaviation and in war; but perhaps by far the greatest death loss comesduring the age of childhood, when vast numbers of the little Martiansfall victims to the great white apes of Mars.The average life expectancy of a Martian after the age of maturity isabout three hundred years, but would be nearer the one-thousand markwere it not for the various means leading to violent death.  Owing tothe waning resources of the planet it evidently became necessary tocounteract the increasing longevity which their remarkable skill intherapeutics and surgery produced, and so human life has come to beconsidered but lightly on Mars, as is evidenced by their dangeroussports and the almost continual warfare between the various communities.There are other and natural causes tending toward a diminution ofpopulation, but nothing contributes so greatly to this end as the factthat no male or female Martian is ever voluntarily without a weapon ofdestruction.As we neared the plaza and my presence was discovered we wereimmediately surrounded by hundreds of the creatures who seemed anxiousto pluck me from my seat behind my guard.  A word from the leader ofthe party stilled their clamor, and we proceeded at a trot across theplaza to the entrance of as magnificent an edifice as mortal eye hasrested upon.The building was low, but covered an enormous area.  It was constructedof gleaming white marble inlaid with gold and brilliant stones whichsparkled and scintillated in the sunlight.  The main entrance was somehundred feet in width and projected from the building proper to form ahuge canopy above the entrance hall.  There was no stairway, but agentle incline to the first floor of the building opened into anenormous chamber encircled by galleries.On the floor of this chamber, which was dotted with highly carvedwooden desks and chairs, were assembled about forty or fifty maleMartians around the steps of a rostrum.  On the platform propersquatted an enormous warrior heavily loaded with metal ornaments,gay-colored feathers and beautifully wrought leather trappingsingeniously set with precious stones.  From his shoulders depended ashort cape of white fur lined with brilliant scarlet silk.What struck me as most remarkable about this assemblage and the hall inwhich they were congregated was the fact that the creatures wereentirely out of proportion to the desks, chairs, and other furnishings;these being of a size adapted to human beings such as I, whereas thegreat bulks of the Martians could scarcely have squeezed into thechairs, nor was there room beneath the desks for their long legs.Evidently, then, there were other denizens on Mars than the wild andgrotesque creatures into whose hands I had fallen, but the evidences ofextreme antiquity which showed all around me indicated that thesebuildings might have belonged to some long-extinct and forgotten racein the dim antiquity of Mars.Our party had halted at the entrance to the building, and at a signfrom the leader I had been lowered to the ground.  Again locking hisarm in mine, we had proceeded into the audience chamber.  There werefew formalities observed in approaching the Martian chieftain.  Mycaptor merely strode up to the rostrum, the others making way for himas he advanced.  The chieftain rose to his feet and uttered the name ofmy escort who, in turn, halted and repeated the name of the rulerfollowed by his title.At the time, this ceremony and the words they uttered meant nothing tome, but later I came to know that this was the customary greetingbetween green Martians.  Had the men been strangers, and thereforeunable to exchange names, they would have silently exchanged ornaments,had their missions been peaceful--otherwise they would have exchangedshots, or have fought out their introduction with some other of theirvarious weapons.My captor, whose name was Tars Tarkas, was virtually the vice-chieftainof the community, and a man of great ability as a statesman andwarrior.  He evidently explained briefly the incidents connected withhis expedition, including my capture, and when he had concluded thechieftain addressed me at some length.I replied in our good old English tongue merely to convince him thatneither of us could understand the other; but I noticed that when Ismiled slightly on concluding, he did likewise.  This fact, and thesimilar occurrence during my first talk with Tars Tarkas, convinced methat we had at least something in common; the ability to smile,therefore to laugh; denoting a sense of humor.  But I was to learn thatthe Martian smile is merely perfunctory, and that the Martian laugh isa thing to cause strong men to blanch in horror.The ideas of humor among the green men of Mars are widely at variancewith our conceptions of incitants to merriment.  The death agonies of afellow being are, to these strange creatures, provocative of the wildesthilarity, while their chief form of commonest amusement is to inflictdeath on their prisoners of war in various ingenious and horrible ways.The assembled warriors and chieftains examined me closely, feeling mymuscles and the texture of my skin.  The principal chieftain thenevidently signified a desire to see me perform, and, motioning me tofollow, he started with Tars Tarkas for the open plaza.Now, I had made no attempt to walk, since my first signal failure,except while tightly grasping Tars Tarkas' arm, and so now I wentskipping and flitting about among the desks and chairs like somemonstrous grasshopper.  After bruising myself severely, much to theamusement of the Martians, I again had recourse to creeping, but thisdid not suit them and I was roughly jerked to my feet by a toweringfellow who had laughed most heartily at my misfortunes.As he banged me down upon my feet his face was bent close to mine and Idid the only thing a gentleman might do under the circumstances ofbrutality, boorishness, and lack of consideration for a stranger'srights; I swung my fist squarely to his jaw and he went down like afelled ox.  As he sunk to the floor I wheeled around with my backtoward the nearest desk, expecting to be overwhelmed by the vengeanceof his fellows, but determined to give them as good a battle as theunequal odds would permit before I gave up my life.My fears were groundless, however, as the other Martians, at firststruck dumb with wonderment, finally broke into wild peals of laughterand applause.  I did not recognize the applause as such, but later,when I had become acquainted with their customs, I learned that I hadwon what they seldom accord, a manifestation of approbation.The fellow whom I had struck lay where he had fallen, nor did any ofhis mates approach him.  Tars Tarkas advanced toward me, holding outone of his arms, and we thus proceeded to the plaza without furthermishap.  I did not, of course, know the reason for which we had come tothe open, but I was not long in being enlightened.  They first repeatedthe word &quot;sak&quot; a number of times, and then Tars Tarkas made severaljumps, repeating the same word before each leap; then, turning to me,he said, &quot;sak!&quot;  I saw what they were after, and gathering myselftogether I &quot;sakked&quot; with such marvelous success that I cleared a goodhundred and fifty feet; nor did I, this time, lose my equilibrium, butlanded squarely upon my feet without falling.  I then returned by easyjumps of twenty-five or thirty feet to the little group of warriors.My exhibition had been witnessed by several hundred lesser Martians,and they immediately broke into demands for a repetition, which thechieftain then ordered me to make; but I was both hungry and thirsty,and determined on the spot that my only method of salvation was todemand the consideration from these creatures which they evidentlywould not voluntarily accord.  I therefore ignored the repeatedcommands to &quot;sak,&quot; and each time they were made I motioned to my mouthand rubbed my stomach.Tars Tarkas and the chief exchanged a few words, and the former,calling to a young female among the throng, gave her some instructionsand motioned me to accompany her.  I grasped her proffered arm andtogether we crossed the plaza toward a large building on the far side.My fair companion was about eight feet tall, having just arrived atmaturity, but not yet to her full height.  She was of a lightolive-green color, with a smooth, glossy hide.  Her name, as Iafterward learned, was Sola, and she belonged to the retinue of TarsTarkas.  She conducted me to a spacious chamber in one of the buildingsfronting on the plaza, and which, from the litter of silks and fursupon the floor, I took to be the sleeping quarters of several of thenatives.The room was well lighted by a number of large windows and wasbeautifully decorated with mural paintings and mosaics, but upon allthere seemed to rest that indefinable touch of the finger of antiquitywhich convinced me that the architects and builders of these wondrouscreations had nothing in common with the crude half-brutes which nowoccupied them.Sola motioned me to be seated upon a pile of silks near the center ofthe room, and, turning, made a peculiar hissing sound, as thoughsignaling to someone in an adjoining room.  In response to her call Iobtained my first sight of a new Martian wonder.  It waddled in on itsten short legs, and squatted down before the girl like an obedientpuppy.  The thing was about the size of a Shetland pony, but its headbore a slight resemblance to that of a frog, except that the jaws wereequipped with three rows of long, sharp tusks.CHAPTER VI ELUDE MY WATCH DOGSola stared into the brute's wicked-looking eyes, muttered a word ortwo of command, pointed to me, and left the chamber.  I could not butwonder what this ferocious-looking monstrosity might do when left alonein such close proximity to such a relatively tender morsel of meat; butmy fears were groundless, as the beast, after surveying me intently fora moment, crossed the room to the only exit which led to the street,and lay down full length across the threshold.This was my first experience with a Martian watch dog, but it wasdestined not to be my last, for this fellow guarded me carefully duringthe time I remained a captive among these green men; twice saving mylife, and never voluntarily being away from me a moment.While Sola was away I took occasion to examine more minutely the roomin which I found myself captive.  The mural painting depicted scenes ofrare and wonderful beauty; mountains, rivers, lake, ocean, meadow,trees and flowers, winding roadways, sun-kissed gardens--scenes whichmight have portrayed earthly views but for the different colorings ofthe vegetation.  The work had evidently been wrought by a master hand,so subtle the atmosphere, so perfect the technique; yet nowhere wasthere a representation of a living animal, either human or brute, bywhich I could guess at the likeness of these other and perhaps extinctdenizens of Mars.While I was allowing my fancy to run riot in wild conjecture on thepossible explanation of the strange anomalies which I had so far metwith on Mars, Sola returned bearing both food and drink.  These sheplaced on the floor beside me, and seating herself a short ways offregarded me intently.  The food consisted of about a pound of somesolid substance of the consistency of cheese and almost tasteless,while the liquid was apparently milk from some animal.  It was notunpleasant to the taste, though slightly acid, and I learned in a shorttime to prize it very highly.  It came, as I later discovered, not froman animal, as there is only one mammal on Mars and that one very rareindeed, but from a large plant which grows practically without water,but seems to distill its plentiful supply of milk from the products ofthe soil, the moisture of the air, and the rays of the sun.  A singleplant of this species will give eight or ten quarts of milk per day.After I had eaten I was greatly invigorated, but feeling the need ofrest I stretched out upon the silks and was soon asleep.  I must haveslept several hours, as it was dark when I awoke, and I was very cold.I noticed that someone had thrown a fur over me, but it had becomepartially dislodged and in the darkness I could not see to replace it.Suddenly a hand reached out and pulled the fur over me, shortlyafterwards adding another to my covering.I presumed that my watchful guardian was Sola, nor was I wrong.  Thisgirl alone, among all the green Martians with whom I came in contact,disclosed characteristics of sympathy, kindliness, and affection; herministrations to my bodily wants were unfailing, and her solicitouscare saved me from much suffering and many hardships.As I was to learn, the Martian nights are extremely cold, and as thereis practically no twilight or dawn, the changes in temperature aresudden and most uncomfortable, as are the transitions from brilliantdaylight to darkness.  The nights are either brilliantly illumined orvery dark, for if neither of the two moons of Mars happen to be in thesky almost total darkness results, since the lack of atmosphere, or,rather, the very thin atmosphere, fails to diffuse the starlight to anygreat extent; on the other hand, if both of the moons are in theheavens at night the surface of the ground is brightly illuminated.Both of Mars' moons are vastly nearer her than is our moon to Earth;the nearer moon being but about five thousand miles distant, while thefurther is but little more than fourteen thousand miles away, againstthe nearly one-quarter million miles which separate us from our moon.The nearer moon of Mars makes a complete revolution around the planetin a little over seven and one-half hours, so that she may be seenhurtling through the sky like some huge meteor two or three times eachnight, revealing all her phases during each transit of the heavens.The further moon revolves about Mars in something over thirty andone-quarter hours, and with her sister satellite makes a nocturnalMartian scene one of splendid and weird grandeur.  And it is well thatnature has so graciously and abundantly lighted the Martian night, forthe green men of Mars, being a nomadic race without high intellectualdevelopment, have but crude means for artificial lighting; dependingprincipally upon torches, a kind of candle, and a peculiar oil lampwhich generates a gas and burns without a wick.This last device produces an intensely brilliant far-reaching whitelight, but as the natural oil which it requires can only be obtained bymining in one of several widely separated and remote localities it isseldom used by these creatures whose only thought is for today, andwhose hatred for manual labor has kept them in a semi-barbaric statefor countless ages.After Sola had replenished my coverings I again slept, nor did I awakenuntil daylight.  The other occupants of the room, five in number, wereall females, and they were still sleeping, piled high with a motleyarray of silks and furs.  Across the threshold lay stretched thesleepless guardian brute, just as I had last seen him on the precedingday; apparently he had not moved a muscle; his eyes were fairly gluedupon me, and I fell to wondering just what might befall me should Iendeavor to escape.I have ever been prone to seek adventure and to investigate andexperiment where wiser men would have left well enough alone.  Ittherefore now occurred to me that the surest way of learning the exactattitude of this beast toward me would be to attempt to leave the room.I felt fairly secure in my belief that I could escape him should hepursue me once I was outside the building, for I had begun to takegreat pride in my ability as a jumper.  Furthermore, I could see fromthe shortness of his legs that the brute himself was no jumper andprobably no runner.Slowly and carefully, therefore, I gained my feet, only to see that mywatcher did the same; cautiously I advanced toward him, finding that bymoving with a shuffling gait I could retain my balance as well as makereasonably rapid progress.  As I neared the brute he backed cautiouslyaway from me, and when I had reached the open he moved to one side tolet me pass.  He then fell in behind me and followed about ten paces inmy rear as I made my way along the deserted street.Evidently his mission was to protect me only, I thought, but when wereached the edge of the city he suddenly sprang before me, utteringstrange sounds and baring his ugly and ferocious tusks.  Thinking tohave some amusement at his expense, I rushed toward him, and whenalmost upon him sprang into the air, alighting far beyond him and awayfrom the city.  He wheeled instantly and charged me with the mostappalling speed I had ever beheld.  I had thought his short legs a barto swiftness, but had he been coursing with greyhounds the latter wouldhave appeared as though asleep on a door mat.  As I was to learn, thisis the fleetest animal on Mars, and owing to its intelligence, loyalty,and ferocity is used in hunting, in war, and as the protector of theMartian man.I quickly saw that I would have difficulty in escaping the fangs of thebeast on a straightaway course, and so I met his charge by doubling inmy tracks and leaping over him as he was almost upon me.  This maneuvergave me a considerable advantage, and I was able to reach the cityquite a bit ahead of him, and as he came tearing after me I jumped fora window about thirty feet from the ground in the face of one of thebuildings overlooking the valley.Grasping the sill I pulled myself up to a sitting posture withoutlooking into the building, and gazed down at the baffled animal beneathme.  My exultation was short-lived, however, for scarcely had I gaineda secure seat upon the sill than a huge hand grasped me by the neckfrom behind and dragged me violently into the room.  Here I was thrownupon my back, and beheld standing over me a colossal ape-like creature,white and hairless except for an enormous shock of bristly hair uponits head.CHAPTER VIA FIGHT THAT WON FRIENDSThe thing, which more nearly resembled our earthly men than it did theMartians I had seen, held me pinioned to the ground with one huge foot,while it jabbered and gesticulated at some answering creature behindme.  This other, which was evidently its mate, soon came toward us,bearing a mighty stone cudgel with which it evidently intended to brainme.The creatures were about ten or fifteen feet tall, standing erect, andhad, like the green Martians, an intermediary set of arms or legs,midway between their upper and lower limbs.  Their eyes were closetogether and non-protruding; their ears were high set, but morelaterally located than those of the Martians, while their snouts andteeth were strikingly like those of our African gorilla.  Altogetherthey were not unlovely when viewed in comparison with the greenMartians.The cudgel was swinging in the arc which ended upon my upturned facewhen a bolt of myriad-legged horror hurled itself through the doorwayfull upon the breast of my executioner.  With a shriek of fear the apewhich held me leaped through the open window, but its mate closed in aterrific death struggle with my preserver, which was nothing less thanmy faithful watch-thing; I cannot bring myself to call so hideous acreature a dog.As quickly as possible I gained my feet and backing against the wall Iwitnessed such a battle as it is vouchsafed few beings to see.  Thestrength, agility, and blind ferocity of these two creatures isapproached by nothing known to earthly man.  My beast had an advantagein his first hold, having sunk his mighty fangs far into the breast ofhis adversary; but the great arms and paws of the ape, backed bymuscles far transcending those of the Martian men I had seen, hadlocked the throat of my guardian and slowly were choking out his life,and bending back his head and neck upon his body, where I momentarilyexpected the former to fall limp at the end of a broken neck.In accomplishing this the ape was tearing away the entire front of itsbreast, which was held in the vise-like grip of the powerful jaws.Back and forth upon the floor they rolled, neither one emitting a soundof fear or pain.  Presently I saw the great eyes of my beast bulgingcompletely from their sockets and blood flowing from its nostrils.That he was weakening perceptibly was evident, but so also was the ape,whose struggles were growing momentarily less.Suddenly I came to myself and, with that strange instinct which seemsever to prompt me to my duty, I seized the cudgel, which had fallen tothe floor at the commencement of the battle, and swinging it with allthe power of my earthly arms I crashed it full upon the head of theape, crushing his skull as though it had been an eggshell.Scarcely had the blow descended when I was confronted with a newdanger.  The ape's mate, recovered from its first shock of terror, hadreturned to the scene of the encounter by way of the interior of thebuilding.  I glimpsed him just before he reached the doorway and thesight of him, now roaring as he perceived his lifeless fellow stretchedupon the floor, and frothing at the mouth, in the extremity of hisrage, filled me, I must confess, with dire forebodings.I am ever willing to stand and fight when the odds are not toooverwhelmingly against me, but in this instance I perceived neitherglory nor profit in pitting my relatively puny strength against theiron muscles and brutal ferocity of this enraged denizen of an unknownworld; in fact, the only outcome of such an encounter, so far as Imight be concerned, seemed sudden death.I was standing near the window and I knew that once in the street Imight gain the plaza and safety before the creature could overtake me;at least there was a chance for safety in flight, against almostcertain death should I remain and fight however desperately.It is true I held the cudgel, but what could I do with it against hisfour great arms?  Even should I break one of them with my first blow,for I figured that he would attempt to ward off the cudgel, he couldreach out and annihilate me with the others before I could recover fora second attack.In the instant that these thoughts passed through my mind I had turnedto make for the window, but my eyes alighting on the form of myerstwhile guardian threw all thoughts of flight to the four winds.  Helay gasping upon the floor of the chamber, his great eyes fastened uponme in what seemed a pitiful appeal for protection.  I could notwithstand that look, nor could I, on second thought, have deserted myrescuer without giving as good an account of myself in his behalf as hehad in mine.Without more ado, therefore, I turned to meet the charge of theinfuriated bull ape.  He was now too close upon me for the cudgel toprove of any effective assistance, so I merely threw it as heavily as Icould at his advancing bulk.  It struck him just below the knees,eliciting a howl of pain and rage, and so throwing him off his balancethat he lunged full upon me with arms wide stretched to ease his fall.Again, as on the preceding day, I had recourse to earthly tactics, andswinging my right fist full upon the point of his chin I followed itwith a smashing left to the pit of his stomach.  The effect wasmarvelous, for, as I lightly sidestepped, after delivering the secondblow, he reeled and fell upon the floor doubled up with pain andgasping for wind.  Leaping over his prostrate body, I seized the cudgeland finished the monster before he could regain his feet.As I delivered the blow a low laugh rang out behind me, and, turning, Ibeheld Tars Tarkas, Sola, and three or four warriors standing in thedoorway of the chamber.  As my eyes met theirs I was, for the secondtime, the recipient of their zealously guarded applause.My absence had been noted by Sola on her awakening, and she had quicklyinformed Tars Tarkas, who had set out immediately with a handful ofwarriors to search for me.  As they had approached the limits of thecity they had witnessed the actions of the bull ape as he bolted intothe building, frothing with rage.They had followed immediately behind him, thinking it barely possiblethat his actions might prove a clew to my whereabouts and had witnessedmy short but decisive battle with him.  This encounter, together withmy set-to with the Martian warrior on the previous day and my feats ofjumping placed me upon a high pinnacle in their regard.  Evidentlydevoid of all the finer sentiments of friendship, love, or affection,these people fairly worship physical prowess and bravery, and nothingis too good for the object of their adoration as long as he maintainshis position by repeated examples of his skill, strength, and courage.Sola, who had accompanied the searching party of her own volition, wasthe only one of the Martians whose face had not been twisted inlaughter as I battled for my life.  She, on the contrary, was soberwith apparent solicitude and, as soon as I had finished the monster,rushed to me and carefully examined my body for possible wounds orinjuries.  Satisfying herself that I had come off unscathed she smiledquietly, and, taking my hand, started toward the door of the chamber.Tars Tarkas and the other warriors had entered and were standing overthe now rapidly reviving brute which had saved my life, and whose lifeI, in turn, had rescued.  They seemed to be deep in argument, andfinally one of them addressed me, but remembering my ignorance of hislanguage turned back to Tars Tarkas, who, with a word and gesture, gavesome command to the fellow and turned to follow us from the room.There seemed something menacing in their attitude toward my beast, andI hesitated to leave until I had learned the outcome.  It was well Idid so, for the warrior drew an evil looking pistol from its holsterand was on the point of putting an end to the creature when I sprangforward and struck up his arm.  The bullet striking the wooden casingof the window exploded, blowing a hole completely through the wood andmasonry.I then knelt down beside the fearsome-looking thing, and raising it toits feet motioned for it to follow me.  The looks of surprise which myactions elicited from the Martians were ludicrous; they could notunderstand, except in a feeble and childish way, such attributes asgratitude and compassion.  The warrior whose gun I had struck up lookedenquiringly at Tars Tarkas, but the latter signed that I be left to myown devices, and so we returned to the plaza with my great beastfollowing close at heel, and Sola grasping me tightly by the arm.I had at least two friends on Mars; a young woman who watched over mewith motherly solicitude, and a dumb brute which, as I later came toknow, held in its poor ugly carcass more love, more loyalty, moregratitude than could have been found in the entire five million greenMartians who rove the deserted cities and dead sea bottoms of Mars.CHAPTER VIICHILD-RAISING ON MARSAfter a breakfast, which was an exact replica of the meal of thepreceding day and an index of practically every meal which followedwhile I was with the green men of Mars, Sola escorted me to the plaza,where I found the entire community engaged in watching or helping atthe harnessing of huge mastodonian animals to great three-wheeledchariots.  There were about two hundred and fifty of these vehicles,each drawn by a single animal, any one of which, from their appearance,might easily have drawn the entire wagon train when fully loaded.The chariots themselves were large, commodious, and gorgeouslydecorated.  In each was seated a female Martian loaded with ornamentsof metal, with jewels and silks and furs, and upon the back of each ofthe beasts which drew the chariots was perched a young Martian driver.Like the animals upon which the warriors were mounted, the heavierdraft animals wore neither bit nor bridle, but were guided entirely bytelepathic means.This power is wonderfully developed in all Martians, and accountslargely for the simplicity of their language and the relatively fewspoken words exchanged even in long conversations.  It is the universallanguage of Mars, through the medium of which the higher and loweranimals of this world of paradoxes are able to communicate to a greateror less extent, depending upon the intellectual sphere of the speciesand the development of the individual.As the cavalcade took up the line of march in single file, Sola draggedme into an empty chariot and we proceeded with the procession towardthe point by which I had entered the city the day before.  At the headof the caravan rode some two hundred warriors, five abreast, and a likenumber brought up the rear, while twenty-five or thirty outridersflanked us on either side.Every one but myself--men, women, and children--were heavily armed, andat the tail of each chariot trotted a Martian hound, my own beastfollowing closely behind ours; in fact, the faithful creature neverleft me voluntarily during the entire ten years I spent on Mars.  Ourway led out across the little valley before the city, through thehills, and down into the dead sea bottom which I had traversed on myjourney from the incubator to the plaza.  The incubator, as it proved,was the terminal point of our journey this day, and, as the entirecavalcade broke into a mad gallop as soon as we reached the levelexpanse of sea bottom, we were soon within sight of our goal.On reaching it the chariots were parked with military precision on thefour sides of the enclosure, and half a score of warriors, headed bythe enormous chieftain, and including Tars Tarkas and several otherlesser chiefs, dismounted and advanced toward it.  I could see TarsTarkas explaining something to the principal chieftain, whose name, bythe way, was, as nearly as I can translate it into English, LorquasPtomel, Jed; jed being his title.I was soon appraised of the subject of their conversation, as, callingto Sola, Tars Tarkas signed for her to send me to him.  I had by thistime mastered the intricacies of walking under Martian conditions, andquickly responding to his command I advanced to the side of theincubator where the warriors stood.As I reached their side a glance showed me that all but a very few eggshad hatched, the incubator being fairly alive with the hideous littledevils.  They ranged in height from three to four feet, and were movingrestlessly about the enclosure as though searching for food.As I came to a halt before him, Tars Tarkas pointed over the incubatorand said, &quot;Sak.&quot;  I saw that he wanted me to repeat my performance ofyesterday for the edification of Lorquas Ptomel, and, as I must confessthat my prowess gave me no little satisfaction, I responded quickly,leaping entirely over the parked chariots on the far side of theincubator.  As I returned, Lorquas Ptomel grunted something at me, andturning to his warriors gave a few words of command relative to theincubator.  They paid no further attention to me and I was thuspermitted to remain close and watch their operations, which consistedin breaking an opening in the wall of the incubator large enough topermit of the exit of the young Martians.On either side of this opening the women and the younger Martians, bothmale and female, formed two solid walls leading out through thechariots and quite away into the plain beyond.  Between these walls thelittle Martians scampered, wild as deer; being permitted to run thefull length of the aisle, where they were captured one at a time by thewomen and older children; the last in the line capturing the firstlittle one to reach the end of the gauntlet, her opposite in the linecapturing the second, and so on until all the little fellows had leftthe enclosure and been appropriated by some youth or female.  As thewomen caught the young they fell out of line and returned to theirrespective chariots, while those who fell into the hands of the youngmen were later turned over to some of the women.I saw that the ceremony, if it could be dignified by such a name, wasover, and seeking out Sola I found her in our chariot with a hideouslittle creature held tightly in her arms.The work of rearing young, green Martians consists solely in teachingthem to talk, and to use the weapons of warfare with which they areloaded down from the very first year of their lives.  Coming from eggsin which they have lain for five years, the period of incubation, theystep forth into the world perfectly developed except in size.  Entirelyunknown to their mothers, who, in turn, would have difficulty inpointing out the fathers with any degree of accuracy, they are thecommon children of the community, and their education devolves upon thefemales who chance to capture them as they leave the incubator.Their foster mothers may not even have had an egg in the incubator, aswas the case with Sola, who had not commenced to lay, until less than ayear before she became the mother of another woman's offspring.  Butthis counts for little among the green Martians, as parental and filiallove is as unknown to them as it is common among us.  I believe thishorrible system which has been carried on for ages is the direct causeof the loss of all the finer feelings and higher humanitarian instinctsamong these poor creatures.  From birth they know no father or motherlove, they know not the meaning of the word home; they are taught thatthey are only suffered to live until they can demonstrate by theirphysique and ferocity that they are fit to live.  Should they provedeformed or defective in any way they are promptly shot; nor do theysee a tear shed for a single one of the many cruel hardships they passthrough from earliest infancy.I do not mean that the adult Martians are unnecessarily orintentionally cruel to the young, but theirs is a hard and pitilessstruggle for existence upon a dying planet, the natural resources ofwhich have dwindled to a point where the support of each additionallife means an added tax upon the community into which it is thrown.By careful selection they rear only the hardiest specimens of eachspecies, and with almost supernatural foresight they regulate the birthrate to merely offset the loss by death.Each adult Martian female brings forth about thirteen eggs each year,and those which meet the size, weight, and specific gravity tests arehidden in the recesses of some subterranean vault where the temperatureis too low for incubation.  Every year these eggs are carefullyexamined by a council of twenty chieftains, and all but about onehundred of the most perfect are destroyed out of each yearly supply.At the end of five years about five hundred almost perfect eggs havebeen chosen from the thousands brought forth.  These are then placed inthe almost air-tight incubators to be hatched by the sun's rays after aperiod of another five years.  The hatching which we had witnessedtoday was a fairly representative event of its kind, all but about oneper cent of the eggs hatching in two days.  If the remaining eggs everhatched we knew nothing of the fate of the little Martians.  They werenot wanted, as their offspring might inherit and transmit the tendencyto prolonged incubation, and thus upset the system which has maintainedfor ages and which permits the adult Martians to figure the proper timefor return to the incubators, almost to an hour.The incubators are built in remote fastnesses, where there is little orno likelihood of their being discovered by other tribes.  The result ofsuch a catastrophe would mean no children in the community for anotherfive years.  I was later to witness the results of the discovery of analien incubator.The community of which the green Martians with whom my lot was castformed a part was composed of some thirty thousand souls.  They roamedan enormous tract of arid and semi-arid land between forty and eightydegrees south latitude, and bounded on the east and west by two largefertile tracts.  Their headquarters lay in the southwest corner of thisdistrict, near the crossing of two of the so-called Martian canals.As the incubator had been placed far north of their own territory in asupposedly uninhabited and unfrequented area, we had before us atremendous journey, concerning which I, of course, knew nothing.After our return to the dead city I passed several days in comparativeidleness.  On the day following our return all the warriors had riddenforth early in the morning and had not returned until just beforedarkness fell.  As I later learned, they had been to the subterraneanvaults in which the eggs were kept and had transported them to theincubator, which they had then walled up for another five years, andwhich, in all probability, would not be visited again during thatperiod.The vaults which hid the eggs until they were ready for the incubatorwere located many miles south of the incubator, and would be visitedyearly by the council of twenty chieftains.  Why they did not arrangeto build their vaults and incubators nearer home has always been amystery to me, and, like many other Martian mysteries, unsolved andunsolvable by earthly reasoning and customs.Sola's duties were now doubled, as she was compelled to care for theyoung Martian as well as for me, but neither one of us required muchattention, and as we were both about equally advanced in Martianeducation, Sola took it upon herself to train us together.Her prize consisted in a male about four feet tall, very strong andphysically perfect; also, he learned quickly, and we had considerableamusement, at least I did, over the keen rivalry we displayed.  TheMartian language, as I have said, is extremely simple, and in a week Icould make all my wants known and understand nearly everything that wassaid to me.  Likewise, under Sola's tutelage, I developed my telepathicpowers so that I shortly could sense practically everything that wenton around me.What surprised Sola most in me was that while I could catch telepathicmessages easily from others, and often when they were not intended forme, no one could read a jot from my mind under any circumstances.  Atfirst this vexed me, but later I was very glad of it, as it gave me anundoubted advantage over the Martians.CHAPTER VIIIA FAIR CAPTIVE FROM THE SKYThe third day after the incubator ceremony we set forth toward home,but scarcely had the head of the procession debouched into the openground before the city than orders were given for an immediate andhasty return.  As though trained for years in this particularevolution, the green Martians melted like mist into the spaciousdoorways of the nearby buildings, until, in less than three minutes,the entire cavalcade of chariots, mastodons and mounted warriors wasnowhere to be seen.Sola and I had entered a building upon the front of the city, in fact,the same one in which I had had my encounter with the apes, and,wishing to see what had caused the sudden retreat, I mounted to anupper floor and peered from the window out over the valley and thehills beyond; and there I saw the cause of their sudden scurrying tocover.  A huge craft, long, low, and gray-painted, swung slowly overthe crest of the nearest hill.  Following it came another, and another,and another, until twenty of them, swinging low above the ground,sailed slowly and majestically toward us.Each carried a strange banner swung from stem to stern above the upperworks, and upon the prow of each was painted some odd device thatgleamed in the sunlight and showed plainly even at the distance atwhich we were from the vessels.  I could see figures crowding theforward decks and upper works of the air craft.  Whether they haddiscovered us or simply were looking at the deserted city I could notsay, but in any event they received a rude reception, for suddenly andwithout warning the green Martian warriors fired a terrific volley fromthe windows of the buildings facing the little valley across which thegreat ships were so peacefully advancing.Instantly the scene changed as by magic; the foremost vessel swungbroadside toward us, and bringing her guns into play returned our fire,at the same time moving parallel to our front for a short distance andthen turning back with the evident intention of completing a greatcircle which would bring her up to position once more opposite ourfiring line; the other vessels followed in her wake, each one openingupon us as she swung into position.  Our own fire never diminished, andI doubt if twenty-five per cent of our shots went wild.  It had neverbeen given me to see such deadly accuracy of aim, and it seemed asthough a little figure on one of the craft dropped at the explosion ofeach bullet, while the banners and upper works dissolved in spurts offlame as the irresistible projectiles of our warriors mowed throughthem.The fire from the vessels was most ineffectual, owing, as I afterwardlearned, to the unexpected suddenness of the first volley, which caughtthe ship's crews entirely unprepared and the sighting apparatus of theguns unprotected from the deadly aim of our warriors.It seems that each green warrior has certain objective points for hisfire under relatively identical circumstances of warfare.  For example,a proportion of them, always the best marksmen, direct their fireentirely upon the wireless finding and sighting apparatus of the bigguns of an attacking naval force; another detail attends to the smallerguns in the same way; others pick off the gunners; still others theofficers; while certain other quotas concentrate their attention uponthe other members of the crew, upon the upper works, and upon thesteering gear and propellers.Twenty minutes after the first volley the great fleet swung trailingoff in the direction from which it had first appeared.  Several of thecraft were limping perceptibly, and seemed but barely under the controlof their depleted crews.  Their fire had ceased entirely and all theirenergies seemed focused upon escape.  Our warriors then rushed up tothe roofs of the buildings which we occupied and followed theretreating armada with a continuous fusillade of deadly fire.One by one, however, the ships managed to dip below the crests of theoutlying hills until only one barely moving craft was in sight.  Thishad received the brunt of our fire and seemed to be entirely unmanned,as not a moving figure was visible upon her decks.  Slowly she swungfrom her course, circling back toward us in an erratic and pitifulmanner.  Instantly the warriors ceased firing, for it was quiteapparent that the vessel was entirely helpless, and, far from being ina position to inflict harm upon us, she could not even control herselfsufficiently to escape.As she neared the city the warriors rushed out upon the plain to meether, but it was evident that she still was too high for them to hope toreach her decks.  From my vantage point in the window I could see thebodies of her crew strewn about, although I could not make out whatmanner of creatures they might be.  Not a sign of life was manifestupon her as she drifted slowly with the light breeze in a southeasterlydirection.She was drifting some fifty feet above the ground, followed by all butsome hundred of the warriors who had been ordered back to the roofs tocover the possibility of a return of the fleet, or of reinforcements.It soon became evident that she would strike the face of the buildingsabout a mile south of our position, and as I watched the progress ofthe chase I saw a number of warriors gallop ahead, dismount and enterthe building she seemed destined to touch.As the craft neared the building, and just before she struck, theMartian warriors swarmed upon her from the windows, and with theirgreat spears eased the shock of the collision, and in a few momentsthey had thrown out grappling hooks and the big boat was being hauledto ground by their fellows below.After making her fast, they swarmed the sides and searched the vesselfrom stem to stern.  I could see them examining the dead sailors,evidently for signs of life, and presently a party of them appearedfrom below dragging a little figure among them.  The creature wasconsiderably less than half as tall as the green Martian warriors, andfrom my balcony I could see that it walked erect upon two legs andsurmised that it was some new and strange Martian monstrosity withwhich I had not as yet become acquainted.They removed their prisoner to the ground and then commenced asystematic rifling of the vessel.  This operation required severalhours, during which time a number of the chariots were requisitioned totransport the loot, which consisted in arms, ammunition, silks, furs,jewels, strangely carved stone vessels, and a quantity of solid foodsand liquids, including many casks of water, the first I had seen sincemy advent upon Mars.After the last load had been removed the warriors made lines fast tothe craft and towed her far out into the valley in a southwesterlydirection.  A few of them then boarded her and were busily engaged inwhat appeared, from my distant position, as the emptying of thecontents of various carboys upon the dead bodies of the sailors andover the decks and works of the vessel.This operation concluded, they hastily clambered over her sides,sliding down the guy ropes to the ground.  The last warrior to leavethe deck turned and threw something back upon the vessel, waiting aninstant to note the outcome of his act.  As a faint spurt of flame rosefrom the point where the missile struck he swung over the side and wasquickly upon the ground.  Scarcely had he alighted than the guy ropeswere simultaneously released, and the great warship, lightened by theremoval of the loot, soared majestically into the air, her decks andupper works a mass of roaring flames.Slowly she drifted to the southeast, rising higher and higher as theflames ate away her wooden parts and diminished the weight upon her.Ascending to the roof of the building I watched her for hours, untilfinally she was lost in the dim vistas of the distance.  The sight wasawe-inspiring in the extreme as one contemplated this mighty floatingfuneral pyre, drifting unguided and unmanned through the lonely wastesof the Martian heavens; a derelict of death and destruction, typifyingthe life story of these strange and ferocious creatures into whoseunfriendly hands fate had carried it.Much depressed, and, to me, unaccountably so, I slowly descended to thestreet.  The scene I had witnessed seemed to mark the defeat andannihilation of the forces of a kindred people, rather than the routingby our green warriors of a horde of similar, though unfriendly,creatures.  I could not fathom the seeming hallucination, nor could Ifree myself from it; but somewhere in the innermost recesses of my soulI felt a strange yearning toward these unknown foemen, and a mightyhope surged through me that the fleet would return and demand areckoning from the green warriors who had so ruthlessly and wantonlyattacked it.Close at my heel, in his now accustomed place, followed Woola, thehound, and as I emerged upon the street Sola rushed up to me as thoughI had been the object of some search on her part.  The cavalcade wasreturning to the plaza, the homeward march having been given up forthat day; nor, in fact, was it recommenced for more than a week, owingto the fear of a return attack by the air craft.Lorquas Ptomel was too astute an old warrior to be caught upon the openplains with a caravan of chariots and children, and so we remained atthe deserted city until the danger seemed passed.As Sola and I entered the plaza a sight met my eyes which filled mywhole being with a great surge of mingled hope, fear, exultation, anddepression, and yet most dominant was a subtle sense of relief andhappiness; for just as we neared the throng of Martians I caught aglimpse of the prisoner from the battle craft who was being roughlydragged into a nearby building by a couple of green Martian females.And the sight which met my eyes was that of a slender, girlish figure,similar in every detail to the earthly women of my past life.  She didnot see me at first, but just as she was disappearing through theportal of the building which was to be her prison she turned, and hereyes met mine.  Her face was oval and beautiful in the extreme, herevery feature was finely chiseled and exquisite, her eyes large andlustrous and her head surmounted by a mass of coal black, waving hair,caught loosely into a strange yet becoming coiffure.  Her skin was of alight reddish copper color, against which the crimson glow of hercheeks and the ruby of her beautifully molded lips shone with astrangely enhancing effect.She was as destitute of clothes as the green Martians who accompaniedher; indeed, save for her highly wrought ornaments she was entirelynaked, nor could any apparel have enhanced the beauty of her perfectand symmetrical figure.As her gaze rested on me her eyes opened wide in astonishment, and shemade a little sign with her free hand; a sign which I did not, ofcourse, understand.  Just a moment we gazed upon each other, and thenthe look of hope and renewed courage which had glorified her face asshe discovered me, faded into one of utter dejection, mingled withloathing and contempt.  I realized I had not answered her signal, andignorant as I was of Martian customs, I intuitively felt that she hadmade an appeal for succor and protection which my unfortunate ignorancehad prevented me from answering.  And then she was dragged out of mysight into the depths of the deserted edifice.CHAPTER IXI LEARN THE LANGUAGEAs I came back to myself I glanced at Sola, who had witnessed thisencounter and I was surprised to note a strange expression upon herusually expressionless countenance.  What her thoughts were I did notknow, for as yet I had learned but little of the Martian tongue; enoughonly to suffice for my daily needs.As I reached the doorway of our building a strange surprise awaited me.A warrior approached bearing the arms, ornaments, and fullaccouterments of his kind.  These he presented to me with a fewunintelligible words, and a bearing at once respectful and menacing.Later, Sola, with the aid of several of the other women, remodeled thetrappings to fit my lesser proportions, and after they completed thework I went about garbed in all the panoply of war.From then on Sola instructed me in the mysteries of the variousweapons, and with the Martian young I spent several hours each daypracticing upon the plaza.  I was not yet proficient with all theweapons, but my great familiarity with similar earthly weapons made mean unusually apt pupil, and I progressed in a very satisfactory manner.The training of myself and the young Martians was conducted solely bythe women, who not only attend to the education of the young in thearts of individual defense and offense, but are also the artisans whoproduce every manufactured article wrought by the green Martians.  Theymake the powder, the cartridges, the firearms; in fact everything ofvalue is produced by the females.  In time of actual warfare they forma part of the reserves, and when the necessity arises fight with evengreater intelligence and ferocity than the men.The men are trained in the higher branches of the art of war; instrategy and the maneuvering of large bodies of troops.  They make thelaws as they are needed; a new law for each emergency.  They areunfettered by precedent in the administration of justice.  Customs havebeen handed down by ages of repetition, but the punishment for ignoringa custom is a matter for individual treatment by a jury of theculprit's peers, and I may say that justice seldom misses fire, butseems rather to rule in inverse ratio to the ascendency of law.  In onerespect at least the Martians are a happy people; they have no lawyers.I did not see the prisoner again for several days subsequent to ourfirst encounter, and then only to catch a fleeting glimpse of her asshe was being conducted to the great audience chamber where I had hadmy first meeting with Lorquas Ptomel.  I could not but note theunnecessary harshness and brutality with which her guards treated her;so different from the almost maternal kindliness which Sola manifestedtoward me, and the respectful attitude of the few green Martians whotook the trouble to notice me at all.I had observed on the two occasions when I had seen her that theprisoner exchanged words with her guards, and this convinced me thatthey spoke, or at least could make themselves understood by a commonlanguage.  With this added incentive I nearly drove Sola distracted bymy importunities to hasten on my education and within a few more days Ihad mastered the Martian tongue sufficiently well to enable me to carryon a passable conversation and to fully understand practically all thatI heard.At this time our sleeping quarters were occupied by three or fourfemales and a couple of the recently hatched young, beside Sola and heryouthful ward, myself, and Woola the hound.  After they had retired forthe night it was customary for the adults to carry on a desultoryconversation for a short time before lapsing into sleep, and now that Icould understand their language I was always a keen listener, althoughI never proffered any remarks myself.On the night following the prisoner's visit to the audience chamber theconversation finally fell upon this subject, and I was all ears on theinstant.  I had feared to question Sola relative to the beautifulcaptive, as I could not but recall the strange expression I had notedupon her face after my first encounter with the prisoner.  That itdenoted jealousy I could not say, and yet, judging all things bymundane standards as I still did, I felt it safer to affectindifference in the matter until I learned more surely Sola's attitudetoward the object of my solicitude.Sarkoja, one of the older women who shared our domicile, had beenpresent at the audience as one of the captive's guards, and it wastoward her the question turned.&quot;When,&quot; asked one of the women, &quot;will we enjoy the death throes of thered one? or does Lorquas Ptomel, Jed, intend holding her for ransom?&quot;&quot;They have decided to carry her with us back to Thark, and exhibit herlast agonies at the great games before Tal Hajus,&quot; replied Sarkoja.&quot;What will be the manner of her going out?&quot; inquired Sola.  &quot;She isvery small and very beautiful; I had hoped that they would hold her forransom.&quot;Sarkoja and the other women grunted angrily at this evidence ofweakness on the part of Sola.&quot;It is sad, Sola, that you were not born a million years ago,&quot; snappedSarkoja, &quot;when all the hollows of the land were filled with water, andthe peoples were as soft as the stuff they sailed upon.  In our day wehave progressed to a point where such sentiments mark weakness andatavism.  It will not be well for you to permit Tars Tarkas to learnthat you hold such degenerate sentiments, as I doubt that he would careto entrust such as you with the grave responsibilities of maternity.&quot;&quot;I see nothing wrong with my expression of interest in this red woman,&quot;retorted Sola.  &quot;She has never harmed us, nor would she should we havefallen into her hands.  It is only the men of her kind who war upon us,and I have ever thought that their attitude toward us is but thereflection of ours toward them.  They live at peace with all theirfellows, except when duty calls upon them to make war, while we are atpeace with none; forever warring among our own kind as well as upon thered men, and even in our own communities the individuals fight amongstthemselves.  Oh, it is one continual, awful period of bloodshed fromthe time we break the shell until we gladly embrace the bosom of theriver of mystery, the dark and ancient Iss which carries us to anunknown, but at least no more frightful and terrible existence!Fortunate indeed is he who meets his end in an early death.  Say whatyou please to Tars Tarkas, he can mete out no worse fate to me than acontinuation of the horrible existence we are forced to lead in thislife.&quot;This wild outbreak on the part of Sola so greatly surprised and shockedthe other women, that, after a few words of general reprimand, they alllapsed into silence and were soon asleep.  One thing the episode hadaccomplished was to assure me of Sola's friendliness toward the poorgirl, and also to convince me that I had been extremely fortunate infalling into her hands rather than those of some of the other females.I knew that she was fond of me, and now that I had discovered that shehated cruelty and barbarity I was confident that I could depend uponher to aid me and the girl captive to escape, provided of course thatsuch a thing was within the range of possibilities.I did not even know that there were any better conditions to escape to,but I was more than willing to take my chances among people fashionedafter my own mold rather than to remain longer among the hideous andbloodthirsty green men of Mars.  But where to go, and how, was as muchof a puzzle to me as the age-old search for the spring of eternal lifehas been to earthly men since the beginning of time.I decided that at the first opportunity I would take Sola into myconfidence and openly ask her to aid me, and with this resolutionstrong upon me I turned among my silks and furs and slept the dreamlessand refreshing sleep of Mars.CHAPTER XCHAMPION AND CHIEFEarly the next morning I was astir.  Considerable freedom was allowedme, as Sola had informed me that so long as I did not attempt to leavethe city I was free to go and come as I pleased.  She had warned me,however, against venturing forth unarmed, as this city, like all otherdeserted metropolises of an ancient Martian civilization, was peopledby the great white apes of my second day's adventure.In advising me that I must not leave the boundaries of the city Solahad explained that Woola would prevent this anyway should I attempt it,and she warned me most urgently not to arouse his fierce nature byignoring his warnings should I venture too close to the forbiddenterritory.  His nature was such, she said, that he would bring me backinto the city dead or alive should I persist in opposing him;&quot;preferably dead,&quot; she added.On this morning I had chosen a new street to explore when suddenly Ifound myself at the limits of the city.  Before me were low hillspierced by narrow and inviting ravines.  I longed to explore thecountry before me, and, like the pioneer stock from which I sprang, toview what the landscape beyond the encircling hills might disclose fromthe summits which shut out my view.It also occurred to me that this would prove an excellent opportunityto test the qualities of Woola.  I was convinced that the brute lovedme; I had seen more evidences of affection in him than in any otherMartian animal, man or beast, and I was sure that gratitude for theacts that had twice saved his life would more than outweigh his loyaltyto the duty imposed upon him by cruel and loveless masters.As I approached the boundary line Woola ran anxiously before me, andthrust his body against my legs.  His expression was pleading ratherthan ferocious, nor did he bare his great tusks or utter his fearfulguttural warnings.  Denied the friendship and companionship of my kind,I had developed considerable affection for Woola and Sola, for thenormal earthly man must have some outlet for his natural affections,and so I decided upon an appeal to a like instinct in this great brute,sure that I would not be disappointed.I had never petted nor fondled him, but now I sat upon the ground andputting my arms around his heavy neck I stroked and coaxed him, talkingin my newly acquired Martian tongue as I would have to my hound athome, as I would have talked to any other friend among the loweranimals.  His response to my manifestation of affection was remarkableto a degree; he stretched his great mouth to its full width, baring theentire expanse of his upper rows of tusks and wrinkling his snout untilhis great eyes were almost hidden by the folds of flesh.  If you haveever seen a collie smile you may have some idea of Woola's facialdistortion.He threw himself upon his back and fairly wallowed at my feet; jumpedup and sprang upon me, rolling me upon the ground by his great weight;then wriggling and squirming around me like a playful puppy presentingits back for the petting it craves.  I could not resist theludicrousness of the spectacle, and holding my sides I rocked back andforth in the first laughter which had passed my lips in many days; thefirst, in fact, since the morning Powell had left camp when his horse,long unused, had precipitately and unexpectedly bucked him offheadforemost into a pot of frijoles.My laughter frightened Woola, his antics ceased and he crawledpitifully toward me, poking his ugly head far into my lap; and then Iremembered what laughter signified on Mars--torture, suffering, death.Quieting myself, I rubbed the poor old fellow's head and back, talkedto him for a few minutes, and then in an authoritative tone commandedhim to follow me, and arising started for the hills.There was no further question of authority between us; Woola was mydevoted slave from that moment hence, and I his only and undisputedmaster.  My walk to the hills occupied but a few minutes, and I foundnothing of particular interest to reward me.  Numerous brilliantlycolored and strangely formed wild flowers dotted the ravines and fromthe summit of the first hill I saw still other hills stretching offtoward the north, and rising, one range above another, until lost inmountains of quite respectable dimensions; though I afterward foundthat only a few peaks on all Mars exceed four thousand feet in height;the suggestion of magnitude was merely relative.My morning's walk had been large with importance to me for it hadresulted in a perfect understanding with Woola, upon whom Tars Tarkasrelied for my safe keeping.  I now knew that while theoretically aprisoner I was virtually free, and I hastened to regain the city limitsbefore the defection of Woola could be discovered by his erstwhilemasters.  The adventure decided me never again to leave the limits ofmy prescribed stamping grounds until I was ready to venture forth forgood and all, as it would certainly result in a curtailment of myliberties, as well as the probable death of Woola, were we to bediscovered.On regaining the plaza I had my third glimpse of the captive girl.  Shewas standing with her guards before the entrance to the audiencechamber, and as I approached she gave me one haughty glance and turnedher back full upon me.  The act was so womanly, so earthly womanly,that though it stung my pride it also warmed my heart with a feeling ofcompanionship; it was good to know that someone else on Mars besidemyself had human instincts of a civilized order, even though themanifestation of them was so painful and mortifying.Had a green Martian woman desired to show dislike or contempt shewould, in all likelihood, have done it with a sword thrust or amovement of her trigger finger; but as their sentiments are mostlyatrophied it would have required a serious injury to have aroused suchpassions in them.  Sola, let me add, was an exception; I never saw herperform a cruel or uncouth act, or fail in uniform kindliness and goodnature.  She was indeed, as her fellow Martian had said of her, anatavism; a dear and precious reversion to a former type of loved andloving ancestor.Seeing that the prisoner seemed the center of attraction I halted toview the proceedings.  I had not long to wait for presently LorquasPtomel and his retinue of chieftains approached the building and,signing the guards to follow with the prisoner entered the audiencechamber.  Realizing that I was a somewhat favored character, and alsoconvinced that the warriors did not know of my proficiency in theirlanguage, as I had plead with Sola to keep this a secret on thegrounds that I did not wish to be forced to talk with the men until Ihad perfectly mastered the Martian tongue, I chanced an attempt toenter the audience chamber and listen to the proceedings.The council squatted upon the steps of the rostrum, while below themstood the prisoner and her two guards.  I saw that one of the women wasSarkoja, and thus understood how she had been present at the hearing ofthe preceding day, the results of which she had reported to theoccupants of our dormitory last night.  Her attitude toward the captivewas most harsh and brutal.  When she held her, she sunk her rudimentarynails into the poor girl's flesh, or twisted her arm in a most painfulmanner.  When it was necessary to move from one spot to another sheeither jerked her roughly, or pushed her headlong before her.  Sheseemed to be venting upon this poor defenseless creature all thehatred, cruelty, ferocity, and spite of her nine hundred years, backedby unguessable ages of fierce and brutal ancestors.The other woman was less cruel because she was entirely indifferent; ifthe prisoner had been left to her alone, and fortunately she was atnight, she would have received no harsh treatment, nor, by the sametoken would she have received any attention at all.As Lorquas Ptomel raised his eyes to address the prisoner they fell onme and he turned to Tars Tarkas with a word, and gesture of impatience.Tars Tarkas made some reply which I could not catch, but which causedLorquas Ptomel to smile; after which they paid no further attention tome.&quot;What is your name?&quot; asked Lorquas Ptomel, addressing the prisoner.&quot;Dejah Thoris, daughter of Mors Kajak of Helium.&quot;&quot;And the nature of your expedition?&quot; he continued.&quot;It was a purely scientific research party sent out by my father'sfather, the Jeddak of Helium, to rechart the air currents, and to takeatmospheric density tests,&quot; replied the fair prisoner, in a low,well-modulated voice.&quot;We were unprepared for battle,&quot; she continued, &quot;as we were on apeaceful mission, as our banners and the colors of our craft denoted.The work we were doing was as much in your interests as in ours, foryou know full well that were it not for our labors and the fruits ofour scientific operations there would not be enough air or water onMars to support a single human life.  For ages we have maintained theair and water supply at practically the same point without anappreciable loss, and we have done this in the face of the brutal andignorant interference of you green men.&quot;Why, oh, why will you not learn to live in amity with your fellows?Must you ever go on down the ages to your final extinction but littleabove the plane of the dumb brutes that serve you!  A people withoutwritten language, without art, without homes, without love; the victimsof eons of the horrible community idea.  Owning everything in common,even to your women and children, has resulted in your owning nothing incommon.  You hate each other as you hate all else except yourselves.Come back to the ways of our common ancestors, come back to the lightof kindliness and fellowship.  The way is open to you, you will findthe hands of the red men stretched out to aid you.  Together we may dostill more to regenerate our dying planet.  The granddaughter of thegreatest and mightiest of the red jeddaks has asked you.  Will youcome?&quot;Lorquas Ptomel and the warriors sat looking silently and intently atthe young woman for several moments after she had ceased speaking.What was passing in their minds no man may know, but that they weremoved I truly believe, and if one man high among them had been strongenough to rise above custom, that moment would have marked a new andmighty era for Mars.I saw Tars Tarkas rise to speak, and on his face was such an expressionas I had never seen upon the countenance of a green Martian warrior.It bespoke an inward and mighty battle with self, with heredity, withage-old custom, and as he opened his mouth to speak, a look almost ofbenignity, of kindliness, momentarily lighted up his fierce andterrible countenance.What words of moment were to have fallen from his lips were neverspoken, as just then a young warrior, evidently sensing the trend ofthought among the older men, leaped down from the steps of the rostrum,and striking the frail captive a powerful blow across the face, whichfelled her to the floor, placed his foot upon her prostrate form andturning toward the assembled council broke into peals of horrid,mirthless laughter.For an instant I thought Tars Tarkas would strike him dead, nor did theaspect of Lorquas Ptomel augur any too favorably for the brute, but themood passed, their old selves reasserted their ascendency, and theysmiled.  It was portentous however that they did not laugh aloud, forthe brute's act constituted a side-splitting witticism according to theethics which rule green Martian humor.That I have taken moments to write down a part of what occurred as thatblow fell does not signify that I remained inactive for any such lengthof time.  I think I must have sensed something of what was coming, forI realize now that I was crouched as for a spring as I saw the blowaimed at her beautiful, upturned, pleading face, and ere the handdescended I was halfway across the hall.Scarcely had his hideous laugh rang out but once, when I was upon him.The brute was twelve feet in height and armed to the teeth, but Ibelieve that I could have accounted for the whole roomful in theterrific intensity of my rage.  Springing upward, I struck him full inthe face as he turned at my warning cry and then as he drew hisshort-sword I drew mine and sprang up again upon his breast, hookingone leg over the butt of his pistol and grasping one of his huge tuskswith my left hand while I delivered blow after blow upon his enormouschest.He could not use his short-sword to advantage because I was too closeto him, nor could he draw his pistol, which he attempted to do indirect opposition to Martian custom which says that you may not fight afellow warrior in private combat with any other than the weapon withwhich you are attacked.  In fact he could do nothing but make a wildand futile attempt to dislodge me.  With all his immense bulk he waslittle if any stronger than I, and it was but the matter of a moment ortwo before he sank, bleeding and lifeless, to the floor.Dejah Thoris had raised herself upon one elbow and was watching thebattle with wide, staring eyes.  When I had regained my feet I raisedher in my arms and bore her to one of the benches at the side of theroom.Again no Martian interfered with me, and tearing a piece of silk frommy cape I endeavored to staunch the flow of blood from her nostrils.  Iwas soon successful as her injuries amounted to little more than anordinary nosebleed, and when she could speak she placed her hand uponmy arm and looking up into my eyes, said:&quot;Why did you do it?  You who refused me even friendly recognition inthe first hour of my peril!  And now you risk your life and kill one ofyour companions for my sake.  I cannot understand.  What strange mannerof man are you, that you consort with the green men, though your formis that of my race, while your color is little darker than that of thewhite ape?  Tell me, are you human, or are you more than human?&quot;&quot;It is a strange tale,&quot; I replied, &quot;too long to attempt to tell younow, and one which I so much doubt the credibility of myself that Ifear to hope that others will believe it.  Suffice it, for the present,that I am your friend, and, so far as our captors will permit, yourprotector and your servant.&quot;&quot;Then you too are a prisoner?  But why, then, those arms and theregalia of a Tharkian chieftain?  What is your name?  Where yourcountry?&quot;&quot;Yes, Dejah Thoris, I too am a prisoner; my name is John Carter, and Iclaim Virginia, one of the United States of America, Earth, as my home;but why I am permitted to wear arms I do not know, nor was I aware thatmy regalia was that of a chieftain.&quot;We were interrupted at this juncture by the approach of one of thewarriors, bearing arms, accoutrements and ornaments, and in a flash oneof her questions was answered and a puzzle cleared up for me.  I sawthat the body of my dead antagonist had been stripped, and I read inthe menacing yet respectful attitude of the warrior who had brought methese trophies of the kill the same demeanor as that evinced by theother who had brought me my original equipment, and now for the firsttime I realized that my blow, on the occasion of my first battle in theaudience chamber had resulted in the death of my adversary.The reason for the whole attitude displayed toward me was now apparent;I had won my spurs, so to speak, and in the crude justice, which alwaysmarks Martian dealings, and which, among other things, has caused me tocall her the planet of paradoxes, I was accorded the honors due aconqueror; the trappings and the position of the man I killed.  Intruth, I was a Martian chieftain, and this I learned later was thecause of my great freedom and my toleration in the audience chamber.As I had turned to receive the dead warrior's chattels I had noticedthat Tars Tarkas and several others had pushed forward toward us, andthe eyes of the former rested upon me in a most quizzical manner.Finally he addressed me:&quot;You speak the tongue of Barsoom quite readily for one who was deaf anddumb to us a few short days ago.  Where did you learn it, John Carter?&quot;&quot;You, yourself, are responsible, Tars Tarkas,&quot; I replied, &quot;in that youfurnished me with an instructress of remarkable ability; I have tothank Sola for my learning.&quot;&quot;She has done well,&quot; he answered, &quot;but your education in other respectsneeds considerable polish.  Do you know what your unprecedentedtemerity would have cost you had you failed to kill either of the twochieftains whose metal you now wear?&quot;&quot;I presume that that one whom I had failed to kill, would have killedme,&quot; I answered, smiling.&quot;No, you are wrong.  Only in the last extremity of self-defense would aMartian warrior kill a prisoner; we like to save them for otherpurposes,&quot; and his face bespoke possibilities that were not pleasant todwell upon.&quot;But one thing can save you now,&quot; he continued.  &quot;Should you, inrecognition of your remarkable valor, ferocity, and prowess, beconsidered by Tal Hajus as worthy of his service you may be taken intothe community and become a full-fledged Tharkian.  Until we reach theheadquarters of Tal Hajus it is the will of Lorquas Ptomel that you beaccorded the respect your acts have earned you.  You will be treated byus as a Tharkian chieftain, but you must not forget that every chiefwho ranks you is responsible for your safe delivery to our mighty andmost ferocious ruler.  I am done.&quot;&quot;I hear you, Tars Tarkas,&quot; I answered.  &quot;As you know I am not ofBarsoom; your ways are not my ways, and I can only act in the future asI have in the past, in accordance with the dictates of my conscienceand guided by the standards of mine own people.  If you will leave mealone I will go in peace, but if not, let the individual Barsoomianswith whom I must deal either respect my rights as a stranger among you,or take whatever consequences may befall.  Of one thing let us be sure,whatever may be your ultimate intentions toward this unfortunate youngwoman, whoever would offer her injury or insult in the future mustfigure on making a full accounting to me.  I understand that youbelittle all sentiments of generosity and kindliness, but I do not, andI can convince your most doughty warrior that these characteristics arenot incompatible with an ability to fight.&quot;Ordinarily I am not given to long speeches, nor ever before had Idescended to bombast, but I had guessed at the keynote which wouldstrike an answering chord in the breasts of the green Martians, nor wasI wrong, for my harangue evidently deeply impressed them, and theirattitude toward me thereafter was still further respectful.Tars Tarkas himself seemed pleased with my reply, but his only commentwas more or less enigmatical--&quot;And I think I know Tal Hajus, Jeddak ofThark.&quot;I now turned my attention to Dejah Thoris, and assisting her to herfeet I turned with her toward the exit, ignoring her hovering guardianharpies as well as the inquiring glances of the chieftains.  Was I notnow a chieftain also!  Well, then, I would assume the responsibilitiesof one.  They did not molest us, and so Dejah Thoris, Princess ofHelium, and John Carter, gentleman of Virginia, followed by thefaithful Woola, passed through utter silence from the audience chamberof Lorquas Ptomel, Jed among the Tharks of Barsoom.CHAPTER XIWITH DEJAH THORISAs we reached the open the two female guards who had been detailed towatch over Dejah Thoris hurried up and made as though to assume custodyof her once more.  The poor child shrank against me and I felt her twolittle hands fold tightly over my arm.  Waving the women away, Iinformed them that Sola would attend the captive hereafter, and Ifurther warned Sarkoja that any more of her cruel attentions bestowedupon Dejah Thoris would result in Sarkoja's sudden and painful demise.My threat was unfortunate and resulted in more harm than good to DejahThoris, for, as I learned later, men do not kill women upon Mars, norwomen, men.  So Sarkoja merely gave us an ugly look and departed tohatch up deviltries against us.I soon found Sola and explained to her that I wished her to guard DejahThoris as she had guarded me; that I wished her to find other quarterswhere they would not be molested by Sarkoja, and I finally informed herthat I myself would take up my quarters among the men.Sola glanced at the accouterments which were carried in my hand andslung across my shoulder.&quot;You are a great chieftain now, John Carter,&quot; she said, &quot;and I must doyour bidding, though indeed I am glad to do it under any circumstances.The man whose metal you carry was young, but he was a great warrior,and had by his promotions and kills won his way close to the rank ofTars Tarkas, who, as you know, is second to Lorquas Ptomel only.  Youare eleventh, there are but ten chieftains in this community who rankyou in prowess.&quot;&quot;And if I should kill Lorquas Ptomel?&quot; I asked.&quot;You would be first, John Carter; but you may only win that honor bythe will of the entire council that Lorquas Ptomel meet you in combat,or should he attack you, you may kill him in self-defense, and thus winfirst place.&quot;I laughed, and changed the subject.  I had no particular desire to killLorquas Ptomel, and less to be a jed among the Tharks.I accompanied Sola and Dejah Thoris in a search for new quarters, whichwe found in a building nearer the audience chamber and of far morepretentious architecture than our former habitation.  We also found inthis building real sleeping apartments with ancient beds of highlywrought metal swinging from enormous gold chains depending from themarble ceilings.  The decoration of the walls was most elaborate, and,unlike the frescoes in the other buildings I had examined, portrayedmany human figures in the compositions.  These were of people likemyself, and of a much lighter color than Dejah Thoris.  They were cladin graceful, flowing robes, highly ornamented with metal and jewels,and their luxuriant hair was of a beautiful golden and reddish bronze.The men were beardless and only a few wore arms.  The scenes depictedfor the most part, a fair-skinned, fair-haired people at play.Dejah Thoris clasped her hands with an exclamation of rapture as shegazed upon these magnificent works of art, wrought by a people longextinct; while Sola, on the other hand, apparently did not see them.We decided to use this room, on the second floor and overlooking theplaza, for Dejah Thoris and Sola, and another room adjoining and in therear for the cooking and supplies.  I then dispatched Sola to bring thebedding and such food and utensils as she might need, telling her thatI would guard Dejah Thoris until her return.As Sola departed Dejah Thoris turned to me with a faint smile.&quot;And whereto, then, would your prisoner escape should you leave her,unless it was to follow you and crave your protection, and ask yourpardon for the cruel thoughts she has harbored against you these pastfew days?&quot;&quot;You are right,&quot; I answered, &quot;there is no escape for either of usunless we go together.&quot;&quot;I heard your challenge to the creature you call Tars Tarkas, and Ithink I understand your position among these people, but what I cannotfathom is your statement that you are not of Barsoom.&quot;&quot;In the name of my first ancestor, then,&quot; she continued, &quot;where may yoube from?  You are like unto my people, and yet so unlike.  You speak mylanguage, and yet I heard you tell Tars Tarkas that you had but learnedit recently.  All Barsoomians speak the same tongue from the ice-cladsouth to the ice-clad north, though their written languages differ.Only in the valley Dor, where the river Iss empties into the lost seaof Korus, is there supposed to be a different language spoken, and,except in the legends of our ancestors, there is no record of aBarsoomian returning up the river Iss, from the shores of Korus in thevalley of Dor.  Do not tell me that you have thus returned!  They wouldkill you horribly anywhere upon the surface of Barsoom if that weretrue; tell me it is not!&quot;Her eyes were filled with a strange, weird light; her voice waspleading, and her little hands, reached up upon my breast, were pressedagainst me as though to wring a denial from my very heart.&quot;I do not know your customs, Dejah Thoris, but in my own Virginia agentleman does not lie to save himself; I am not of Dor; I have neverseen the mysterious Iss; the lost sea of Korus is still lost, so far asI am concerned.  Do you believe me?&quot;And then it struck me suddenly that I was very anxious that she shouldbelieve me.  It was not that I feared the results which would follow ageneral belief that I had returned from the Barsoomian heaven or hell,or whatever it was.  Why was it, then!  Why should I care what shethought?  I looked down at her; her beautiful face upturned, and herwonderful eyes opening up the very depth of her soul; and as my eyesmet hers I knew why, and--I shuddered.A similar wave of feeling seemed to stir her; she drew away from mewith a sigh, and with her earnest, beautiful face turned up to mine,she whispered: &quot;I believe you, John Carter; I do not know what a'gentleman' is, nor have I ever heard before of Virginia; but onBarsoom no man lies; if he does not wish to speak the truth he issilent.  Where is this Virginia, your country, John Carter?&quot; she asked,and it seemed that this fair name of my fair land had never soundedmore beautiful than as it fell from those perfect lips on that far-goneday.&quot;I am of another world,&quot; I answered, &quot;the great planet Earth, whichrevolves about our common sun and next within the orbit of yourBarsoom, which we know as Mars.  How I came here I cannot tell you, forI do not know; but here I am, and since my presence has permitted me toserve Dejah Thoris I am glad that I am here.&quot;She gazed at me with troubled eyes, long and questioningly.  That itwas difficult to believe my statement I well knew, nor could I hopethat she would do so however much I craved her confidence and respect.I would much rather not have told her anything of my antecedents, butno man could look into the depth of those eyes and refuse her slightestbehest.Finally she smiled, and, rising, said: &quot;I shall have to believe eventhough I cannot understand.  I can readily perceive that you are not ofthe Barsoom of today; you are like us, yet different--but why should Itrouble my poor head with such a problem, when my heart tells me that Ibelieve because I wish to believe!&quot;It was good logic, good, earthly, feminine logic, and if it satisfiedher I certainly could pick no flaws in it.  As a matter of fact it wasabout the only kind of logic that could be brought to bear upon myproblem.  We fell into a general conversation then, asking andanswering many questions on each side.  She was curious to learn of thecustoms of my people and displayed a remarkable knowledge of events onEarth.  When I questioned her closely on this seeming familiarity withearthly things she laughed, and cried out:&quot;Why, every school boy on Barsoom knows the geography, and muchconcerning the fauna and flora, as well as the history of your planetfully as well as of his own.  Can we not see everything which takesplace upon Earth, as you call it; is it not hanging there in theheavens in plain sight?&quot;This baffled me, I must confess, fully as much as my statements hadconfounded her; and I told her so.  She then explained in general theinstruments her people had used and been perfecting for ages, whichpermit them to throw upon a screen a perfect image of what istranspiring upon any planet and upon many of the stars.  These picturesare so perfect in detail that, when photographed and enlarged, objectsno greater than a blade of grass may be distinctly recognized.  Iafterward, in Helium, saw many of these pictures, as well as theinstruments which produced them.&quot;If, then, you are so familiar with earthly things,&quot; I asked, &quot;why isit that you do not recognize me as identical with the inhabitants ofthat planet?&quot;She smiled again as one might in bored indulgence of a questioningchild.&quot;Because, John Carter,&quot; she replied, &quot;nearly every planet and starhaving atmospheric conditions at all approaching those of Barsoom,shows forms of animal life almost identical with you and me; and,further, Earth men, almost without exception, cover their bodies withstrange, unsightly pieces of cloth, and their heads with hideouscontraptions the purpose of which we have been unable to conceive;while you, when found by the Tharkian warriors, were entirelyundisfigured and unadorned.&quot;The fact that you wore no ornaments is a strong proof of yourun-Barsoomian origin, while the absence of grotesque coverings mightcause a doubt as to your earthliness.&quot;I then narrated the details of my departure from the Earth, explainingthat my body there lay fully clothed in all the, to her, strangegarments of mundane dwellers.  At this point Sola returned with ourmeager belongings and her young Martian protege, who, of course, wouldhave to share the quarters with them.Sola asked us if we had had a visitor during her absence, and seemedmuch surprised when we answered in the negative.  It seemed that as shehad mounted the approach to the upper floors where our quarters werelocated, she had met Sarkoja descending.  We decided that she must havebeen eavesdropping, but as we could recall nothing of importance thathad passed between us we dismissed the matter as of little consequence,merely promising ourselves to be warned to the utmost caution in thefuture.Dejah Thoris and I then fell to examining the architecture anddecorations of the beautiful chambers of the building we wereoccupying.  She told me that these people had presumably flourishedover a hundred thousand years before.  They were the early progenitorsof her race, but had mixed with the other great race of early Martians,who were very dark, almost black, and also with the reddish yellow racewhich had flourished at the same time.These three great divisions of the higher Martians had been forced intoa mighty alliance as the drying up of the Martian seas had compelledthem to seek the comparatively few and always diminishing fertileareas, and to defend themselves, under new conditions of life, againstthe wild hordes of green men.Ages of close relationship and intermarrying had resulted in the raceof red men, of which Dejah Thoris was a fair and beautiful daughter.During the ages of hardships and incessant warring between their ownvarious races, as well as with the green men, and before they hadfitted themselves to the changed conditions, much of the highcivilization and many of the arts of the fair-haired Martians hadbecome lost; but the red race of today has reached a point where itfeels that it has made up in new discoveries and in a more practicalcivilization for all that lies irretrievably buried with the ancientBarsoomians, beneath the countless intervening ages.These ancient Martians had been a highly cultivated and literary race,but during the vicissitudes of those trying centuries of readjustmentto new conditions, not only did their advancement and production ceaseentirely, but practically all their archives, records, and literaturewere lost.Dejah Thoris related many interesting facts and legends concerning thislost race of noble and kindly people.  She said that the city in whichwe were camping was supposed to have been a center of commerce andculture known as Korad.  It had been built upon a beautiful, naturalharbor, landlocked by magnificent hills.  The little valley on the westfront of the city, she explained, was all that remained of the harbor,while the pass through the hills to the old sea bottom had been thechannel through which the shipping passed up to the city's gates.The shores of the ancient seas were dotted with just such cities, andlesser ones, in diminishing numbers, were to be found converging towardthe center of the oceans, as the people had found it necessary tofollow the receding waters until necessity had forced upon them theirultimate salvation, the so-called Martian canals.We had been so engrossed in exploration of the building and in ourconversation that it was late in the afternoon before we realized it.We were brought back to a realization of our present conditions by amessenger bearing a summons from Lorquas Ptomel directing me to appearbefore him forthwith.  Bidding Dejah Thoris and Sola farewell, andcommanding Woola to remain on guard, I hastened to the audiencechamber, where I found Lorquas Ptomel and Tars Tarkas seated upon therostrum.CHAPTER XIIA PRISONER WITH POWERAs I entered and saluted, Lorquas Ptomel signaled me to advance, and,fixing his great, hideous eyes upon me, addressed me thus:&quot;You have been with us a few days, yet during that time you have byyour prowess won a high position among us.  Be that as it may, you arenot one of us; you owe us no allegiance.&quot;Your position is a peculiar one,&quot; he continued; &quot;you are a prisonerand yet you give commands which must be obeyed; you are an alien andyet you are a Tharkian chieftain; you are a midget and yet you can killa mighty warrior with one blow of your fist.  And now you are reportedto have been plotting to escape with another prisoner of another race;a prisoner who, from her own admission, half believes you are returnedfrom the valley of Dor.  Either one of these accusations, if proved,would be sufficient grounds for your execution, but we are a justpeople and you shall have a trial on our return to Thark, if Tal Hajusso commands.&quot;But,&quot; he continued, in his fierce guttural tones, &quot;if you run off withthe red girl it is I who shall have to account to Tal Hajus; it is Iwho shall have to face Tars Tarkas, and either demonstrate my right tocommand, or the metal from my dead carcass will go to a better man, forsuch is the custom of the Tharks.&quot;I have no quarrel with Tars Tarkas; together we rule supreme thegreatest of the lesser communities among the green men; we do not wishto fight between ourselves; and so if you were dead, John Carter, Ishould be glad.  Under two conditions only, however, may you be killedby us without orders from Tal Hajus; in personal combat inself-defense, should you attack one of us, or were you apprehended inan attempt to escape.&quot;As a matter of justice I must warn you that we only await one of thesetwo excuses for ridding ourselves of so great a responsibility.  Thesafe delivery of the red girl to Tal Hajus is of the greatestimportance.  Not in a thousand years have the Tharks made such acapture; she is the granddaughter of the greatest of the red jeddaks,who is also our bitterest enemy.  I have spoken.  The red girl told usthat we were without the softer sentiments of humanity, but we are ajust and truthful race.  You may go.&quot;Turning, I left the audience chamber.  So this was the beginning ofSarkoja's persecution!  I knew that none other could be responsible forthis report which had reached the ears of Lorquas Ptomel so quickly,and now I recalled those portions of our conversation which had touchedupon escape and upon my origin.Sarkoja was at this time Tars Tarkas' oldest and most trusted female.As such she was a mighty power behind the throne, for no warrior hadthe confidence of Lorquas Ptomel to such an extent as did his ablestlieutenant, Tars Tarkas.However, instead of putting thoughts of possible escape from my mind,my audience with Lorquas Ptomel only served to center my every facultyon this subject.  Now, more than before, the absolute necessity forescape, in so far as Dejah Thoris was concerned, was impressed upon me,for I was convinced that some horrible fate awaited her at theheadquarters of Tal Hajus.As described by Sola, this monster was the exaggerated personificationof all the ages of cruelty, ferocity, and brutality from which he haddescended.  Cold, cunning, calculating; he was, also, in markedcontrast to most of his fellows, a slave to that brute passion whichthe waning demands for procreation upon their dying planet has almoststilled in the Martian breast.The thought that the divine Dejah Thoris might fall into the clutchesof such an abysmal atavism started the cold sweat upon me.  Far betterthat we save friendly bullets for ourselves at the last moment, as didthose brave frontier women of my lost land, who took their own livesrather than fall into the hands of the Indian braves.As I wandered about the plaza lost in my gloomy forebodings Tars Tarkasapproached me on his way from the audience chamber.  His demeanortoward me was unchanged, and he greeted me as though we had not justparted a few moments before.&quot;Where are your quarters, John Carter?&quot; he asked.&quot;I have selected none,&quot; I replied.  &quot;It seemed best that I quarteredeither by myself or among the other warriors, and I was awaiting anopportunity to ask your advice.  As you know,&quot; and I smiled, &quot;I am notyet familiar with all the customs of the Tharks.&quot;&quot;Come with me,&quot; he directed, and together we moved off across the plazato a building which I was glad to see adjoined that occupied by Solaand her charges.&quot;My quarters are on the first floor of this building,&quot; he said, &quot;andthe second floor also is fully occupied by warriors, but the thirdfloor and the floors above are vacant; you may take your choice ofthese.&quot;I understand,&quot; he continued, &quot;that you have given up your woman to thered prisoner.  Well, as you have said, your ways are not our ways, butyou can fight well enough to do about as you please, and so, if youwish to give your woman to a captive, it is your own affair; but as achieftain you should have those to serve you, and in accordance withour customs you may select any or all the females from the retinues ofthe chieftains whose metal you now wear.&quot;I thanked him, but assured him that I could get along very nicelywithout assistance except in the matter of preparing food, and so hepromised to send women to me for this purpose and also for the care ofmy arms and the manufacture of my ammunition, which he said would benecessary.  I suggested that they might also bring some of the sleepingsilks and furs which belonged to me as spoils of combat, for the nightswere cold and I had none of my own.He promised to do so, and departed.  Left alone, I ascended the windingcorridor to the upper floors in search of suitable quarters.  Thebeauties of the other buildings were repeated in this, and, as usual, Iwas soon lost in a tour of investigation and discovery.I finally chose a front room on the third floor, because this broughtme nearer to Dejah Thoris, whose apartment was on the second floor ofthe adjoining building, and it flashed upon me that I could rig up somemeans of communication whereby she might signal me in case she neededeither my services or my protection.Adjoining my sleeping apartment were baths, dressing rooms, and othersleeping and living apartments, in all some ten rooms on this floor.The windows of the back rooms overlooked an enormous court, whichformed the center of the square made by the buildings which faced thefour contiguous streets, and which was now given over to the quarteringof the various animals belonging to the warriors occupying theadjoining buildings.While the court was entirely overgrown with the yellow, moss-likevegetation which blankets practically the entire surface of Mars, yetnumerous fountains, statuary, benches, and pergola-like contraptionsbore witness to the beauty which the court must have presented inbygone times, when graced by the fair-haired, laughing people whomstern and unalterable cosmic laws had driven not only from their homes,but from all except the vague legends of their descendants.One could easily picture the gorgeous foliage of the luxuriant Martianvegetation which once filled this scene with life and color; thegraceful figures of the beautiful women, the straight and handsome men;the happy frolicking children--all sunlight, happiness and peace.  Itwas difficult to realize that they had gone; down through ages ofdarkness, cruelty, and ignorance, until their hereditary instincts ofculture and humanitarianism had risen ascendant once more in the finalcomposite race which now is dominant upon Mars.My thoughts were cut short by the advent of several young femalesbearing loads of weapons, silks, furs, jewels, cooking utensils, andcasks of food and drink, including considerable loot from the aircraft.  All this, it seemed, had been the property of the twochieftains I had slain, and now, by the customs of the Tharks, it hadbecome mine.  At my direction they placed the stuff in one of the backrooms, and then departed, only to return with a second load, which theyadvised me constituted the balance of my goods.  On the second tripthey were accompanied by ten or fifteen other women and youths, who, itseemed, formed the retinues of the two chieftains.They were not their families, nor their wives, nor their servants; therelationship was peculiar, and so unlike anything known to us that itis most difficult to describe.  All property among the green Martiansis owned in common by the community, except the personal weapons,ornaments and sleeping silks and furs of the individuals.  These alonecan one claim undisputed right to, nor may he accumulate more of thesethan are required for his actual needs.  The surplus he holds merely ascustodian, and it is passed on to the younger members of the communityas necessity demands.The women and children of a man's retinue may be likened to a militaryunit for which he is responsible in various ways, as in matters ofinstruction, discipline, sustenance, and the exigencies of theircontinual roamings and their unending strife with other communities andwith the red Martians.  His women are in no sense wives.  The greenMartians use no word corresponding in meaning with this earthly word.Their mating is a matter of community interest solely, and is directedwithout reference to natural selection.  The council of chieftains ofeach community control the matter as surely as the owner of a Kentuckyracing stud directs the scientific breeding of his stock for theimprovement of the whole.In theory it may sound well, as is often the case with theories, butthe results of ages of this unnatural practice, coupled with thecommunity interest in the offspring being held paramount to that of themother, is shown in the cold, cruel creatures, and their gloomy,loveless, mirthless existence.It is true that the green Martians are absolutely virtuous, both menand women, with the exception of such degenerates as Tal Hajus; butbetter far a finer balance of human characteristics even at the expenseof a slight and occasional loss of chastity.Finding that I must assume responsibility for these creatures, whetherI would or not, I made the best of it and directed them to findquarters on the upper floors, leaving the third floor to me.  One ofthe girls I charged with the duties of my simple cuisine, and directedthe others to take up the various activities which had formerlyconstituted their vocations.  Thereafter I saw little of them, nor didI care to.CHAPTER XIIILOVE-MAKING ON MARSFollowing the battle with the air ships, the community remained withinthe city for several days, abandoning the homeward march until theycould feel reasonably assured that the ships would not return; for tobe caught on the open plains with a cavalcade of chariots and childrenwas far from the desire of even so warlike a people as the greenMartians.During our period of inactivity, Tars Tarkas had instructed me in manyof the customs and arts of war familiar to the Tharks, includinglessons in riding and guiding the great beasts which bore the warriors.These creatures, which are known as thoats, are as dangerous andvicious as their masters, but when once subdued are sufficientlytractable for the purposes of the green Martians.Two of these animals had fallen to me from the warriors whose metal Iwore, and in a short time I could handle them quite as well as thenative warriors.  The method was not at all complicated.  If the thoatsdid not respond with sufficient celerity to the telepathic instructionsof their riders they were dealt a terrific blow between the ears withthe butt of a pistol, and if they showed fight this treatment wascontinued until the brutes either were subdued, or had unseated theirriders.In the latter case it became a life and death struggle between the manand the beast.  If the former were quick enough with his pistol hemight live to ride again, though upon some other beast; if not, historn and mangled body was gathered up by his women and burned inaccordance with Tharkian custom.My experience with Woola determined me to attempt the experiment ofkindness in my treatment of my thoats.  First I taught them that theycould not unseat me, and even rapped them sharply between the ears toimpress upon them my authority and mastery.  Then, by degrees, I wontheir confidence in much the same manner as I had adopted countlesstimes with my many mundane mounts.  I was ever a good hand withanimals, and by inclination, as well as because it brought more lastingand satisfactory results, I was always kind and humane in my dealingswith the lower orders.  I could take a human life, if necessary, withfar less compunction than that of a poor, unreasoning, irresponsiblebrute.In the course of a few days my thoats were the wonder of the entirecommunity.  They would follow me like dogs, rubbing their great snoutsagainst my body in awkward evidence of affection, and respond to myevery command with an alacrity and docility which caused the Martianwarriors to ascribe to me the possession of some earthly power unknownon Mars.&quot;How have you bewitched them?&quot; asked Tars Tarkas one afternoon, when hehad seen me run my arm far between the great jaws of one of my thoatswhich had wedged a piece of stone between two of his teeth whilefeeding upon the moss-like vegetation within our court yard.&quot;By kindness,&quot; I replied.  &quot;You see, Tars Tarkas, the softer sentimentshave their value, even to a warrior.  In the height of battle as wellas upon the march I know that my thoats will obey my every command, andtherefore my fighting efficiency is enhanced, and I am a better warriorfor the reason that I am a kind master.  Your other warriors would findit to the advantage of themselves as well as of the community to adoptmy methods in this respect.  Only a few days since you, yourself, toldme that these great brutes, by the uncertainty of their tempers, oftenwere the means of turning victory into defeat, since, at a crucialmoment, they might elect to unseat and rend their riders.&quot;&quot;Show me how you accomplish these results,&quot; was Tars Tarkas' onlyrejoinder.And so I explained as carefully as I could the entire method oftraining I had adopted with my beasts, and later he had me repeat itbefore Lorquas Ptomel and the assembled warriors.  That moment markedthe beginning of a new existence for the poor thoats, and before I leftthe community of Lorquas Ptomel I had the satisfaction of observing aregiment of as tractable and docile mounts as one might care to see.The effect on the precision and celerity of the military movements wasso remarkable that Lorquas Ptomel presented me with a massive anklet ofgold from his own leg, as a sign of his appreciation of my service tothe horde.On the seventh day following the battle with the air craft we againtook up the march toward Thark, all probability of another attack beingdeemed remote by Lorquas Ptomel.During the days just preceding our departure I had seen but little ofDejah Thoris, as I had been kept very busy by Tars Tarkas with mylessons in the art of Martian warfare, as well as in the training of mythoats.  The few times I had visited her quarters she had been absent,walking upon the streets with Sola, or investigating the buildings inthe near vicinity of the plaza.  I had warned them against venturingfar from the plaza for fear of the great white apes, whose ferocity Iwas only too well acquainted with.  However, since Woola accompaniedthem on all their excursions, and as Sola was well armed, there wascomparatively little cause for fear.On the evening before our departure I saw them approaching along one ofthe great avenues which lead into the plaza from the east.  I advancedto meet them, and telling Sola that I would take the responsibility forDejah Thoris' safekeeping, I directed her to return to her quarters onsome trivial errand.  I liked and trusted Sola, but for some reason Idesired to be alone with Dejah Thoris, who represented to me all that Ihad left behind upon Earth in agreeable and congenial companionship.There seemed bonds of mutual interest between us as powerful as thoughwe had been born under the same roof rather than upon differentplanets, hurtling through space some forty-eight million miles apart.That she shared my sentiments in this respect I was positive, for on myapproach the look of pitiful hopelessness left her sweet countenance tobe replaced by a smile of joyful welcome, as she placed her littleright hand upon my left shoulder in true red Martian salute.&quot;Sarkoja told Sola that you had become a true Thark,&quot; she said, &quot;andthat I would now see no more of you than of any of the other warriors.&quot;&quot;Sarkoja is a liar of the first magnitude,&quot; I replied, &quot;notwithstandingthe proud claim of the Tharks to absolute verity.&quot;Dejah Thoris laughed.&quot;I knew that even though you became a member of the community you wouldnot cease to be my friend; 'A warrior may change his metal, but not hisheart,' as the saying is upon Barsoom.&quot;&quot;I think they have been trying to keep us apart,&quot; she continued, &quot;forwhenever you have been off duty one of the older women of Tars Tarkas'retinue has always arranged to trump up some excuse to get Sola and meout of sight.  They have had me down in the pits below the buildingshelping them mix their awful radium powder, and make their terribleprojectiles.  You know that these have to be manufactured by artificiallight, as exposure to sunlight always results in an explosion.  Youhave noticed that their bullets explode when they strike an object?Well, the opaque, outer coating is broken by the impact, exposing aglass cylinder, almost solid, in the forward end of which is a minuteparticle of radium powder.  The moment the sunlight, even thoughdiffused, strikes this powder it explodes with a violence which nothingcan withstand.  If you ever witness a night battle you will note theabsence of these explosions, while the morning following the battlewill be filled at sunrise with the sharp detonations of explodingmissiles fired the preceding night.  As a rule, however, non-explodingprojectiles are used at night.&quot;  [I have used the word radium indescribing this powder because in the light of recent discoveries onEarth I believe it to be a mixture of which radium is the base.  InCaptain Carter's manuscript it is mentioned always by the name used inthe written language of Helium and is spelled in hieroglyphics which itwould be difficult and useless to reproduce.]While I was much interested in Dejah Thoris' explanation of thiswonderful adjunct to Martian warfare, I was more concerned by theimmediate problem of their treatment of her.  That they were keepingher away from me was not a matter for surprise, but that they shouldsubject her to dangerous and arduous labor filled me with rage.&quot;Have they ever subjected you to cruelty and ignominy, Dejah Thoris?&quot; Iasked, feeling the hot blood of my fighting ancestors leap in my veinsas I awaited her reply.&quot;Only in little ways, John Carter,&quot; she answered.  &quot;Nothing that canharm me outside my pride.  They know that I am the daughter of tenthousand jeddaks, that I trace my ancestry straight back without abreak to the builder of the first great waterway, and they, who do noteven know their own mothers, are jealous of me.  At heart they hatetheir horrid fates, and so wreak their poor spite on me who stand foreverything they have not, and for all they most crave and never canattain.  Let us pity them, my chieftain, for even though we die attheir hands we can afford them pity, since we are greater than they andthey know it.&quot;Had I known the significance of those words &quot;my chieftain,&quot; as appliedby a red Martian woman to a man, I should have had the surprise of mylife, but I did not know at that time, nor for many months thereafter.Yes, I still had much to learn upon Barsoom.&quot;I presume it is the better part of wisdom that we bow to our fate withas good grace as possible, Dejah Thoris; but I hope, nevertheless, thatI may be present the next time that any Martian, green, red, pink, orviolet, has the temerity to even so much as frown on you, my princess.&quot;Dejah Thoris caught her breath at my last words, and gazed upon me withdilated eyes and quickening breath, and then, with an odd little laugh,which brought roguish dimples to the corners of her mouth, she shookher head and cried:&quot;What a child!  A great warrior and yet a stumbling little child.&quot;&quot;What have I done now?&quot; I asked, in sore perplexity.&quot;Some day you shall know, John Carter, if we live; but I may not tellyou.  And I, the daughter of Mors Kajak, son of Tardos Mors, havelistened without anger,&quot; she soliloquized in conclusion.Then she broke out again into one of her gay, happy, laughing moods;joking with me on my prowess as a Thark warrior as contrasted with mysoft heart and natural kindliness.&quot;I presume that should you accidentally wound an enemy you would takehim home and nurse him back to health,&quot; she laughed.&quot;That is precisely what we do on Earth,&quot; I answered.  &quot;At least amongcivilized men.&quot;This made her laugh again.  She could not understand it, for, with allher tenderness and womanly sweetness, she was still a Martian, and to aMartian the only good enemy is a dead enemy; for every dead foemanmeans so much more to divide between those who live.I was very curious to know what I had said or done to cause her so muchperturbation a moment before and so I continued to importune her toenlighten me.&quot;No,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;it is enough that you have said it and that Ihave listened.  And when you learn, John Carter, and if I be dead, aslikely I shall be ere the further moon has circled Barsoom anothertwelve times, remember that I listened and that I--smiled.&quot;It was all Greek to me, but the more I begged her to explain the morepositive became her denials of my request, and, so, in veryhopelessness, I desisted.Day had now given away to night and as we wandered along the greatavenue lighted by the two moons of Barsoom, and with Earth looking downupon us out of her luminous green eye, it seemed that we were alone inthe universe, and I, at least, was content that it should be so.The chill of the Martian night was upon us, and removing my silks Ithrew them across the shoulders of Dejah Thoris.  As my arm rested foran instant upon her I felt a thrill pass through every fiber of mybeing such as contact with no other mortal had even produced; and itseemed to me that she had leaned slightly toward me, but of that I wasnot sure.  Only I knew that as my arm rested there across her shoulderslonger than the act of adjusting the silk required she did not drawaway, nor did she speak.  And so, in silence, we walked the surface ofa dying world, but in the breast of one of us at least had been bornthat which is ever oldest, yet ever new.I loved Dejah Thoris.  The touch of my arm upon her naked shoulder hadspoken to me in words I would not mistake, and I knew that I had lovedher since the first moment that my eyes had met hers that first time inthe plaza of the dead city of Korad.CHAPTER XIVA DUEL TO THE DEATHMy first impulse was to tell her of my love, and then I thought of thehelplessness of her position wherein I alone could lighten the burdensof her captivity, and protect her in my poor way against the thousandsof hereditary enemies she must face upon our arrival at Thark.  I couldnot chance causing her additional pain or sorrow by declaring a lovewhich, in all probability she did not return.  Should I be soindiscreet, her position would be even more unbearable than now, andthe thought that she might feel that I was taking advantage of herhelplessness, to influence her decision was the final argument whichsealed my lips.&quot;Why are you so quiet, Dejah Thoris?&quot; I asked.  &quot;Possibly you wouldrather return to Sola and your quarters.&quot;&quot;No,&quot; she murmured, &quot;I am happy here.  I do not know why it is that Ishould always be happy and contented when you, John Carter, a stranger,are with me; yet at such times it seems that I am safe and that, withyou, I shall soon return to my father's court and feel his strong armsabout me and my mother's tears and kisses on my cheek.&quot;&quot;Do people kiss, then, upon Barsoom?&quot; I asked, when she had explainedthe word she used, in answer to my inquiry as to its meaning.&quot;Parents, brothers, and sisters, yes; and,&quot; she added in a low,thoughtful tone, &quot;lovers.&quot;&quot;And you, Dejah Thoris, have parents and brothers and sisters?&quot;&quot;Yes.&quot;&quot;And a--lover?&quot;She was silent, nor could I venture to repeat the question.&quot;The man of Barsoom,&quot; she finally ventured, &quot;does not ask personalquestions of women, except his mother, and the woman he has fought forand won.&quot;&quot;But I have fought--&quot; I started, and then I wished my tongue had beencut from my mouth; for she turned even as I caught myself and ceased,and drawing my silks from her shoulder she held them out to me, andwithout a word, and with head held high, she moved with the carriage ofthe queen she was toward the plaza and the doorway of her quarters.I did not attempt to follow her, other than to see that she reached thebuilding in safety, but, directing Woola to accompany her, I turneddisconsolately and entered my own house.  I sat for hours cross-legged,and cross-tempered, upon my silks meditating upon the queer freakschance plays upon us poor devils of mortals.So this was love!  I had escaped it for all the years I had roamed thefive continents and their encircling seas; in spite of beautiful womenand urging opportunity; in spite of a half-desire for love and aconstant search for my ideal, it had remained for me to fall furiouslyand hopelessly in love with a creature from another world, of a speciessimilar possibly, yet not identical with mine.  A woman who was hatchedfrom an egg, and whose span of life might cover a thousand years; whosepeople had strange customs and ideas; a woman whose hopes, whosepleasures, whose standards of virtue and of right and wrong might varyas greatly from mine as did those of the green Martians.Yes, I was a fool, but I was in love, and though I was suffering thegreatest misery I had ever known I would not have had it otherwise forall the riches of Barsoom.  Such is love, and such are lovers whereverlove is known.To me, Dejah Thoris was all that was perfect; all that was virtuous andbeautiful and noble and good.  I believed that from the bottom of myheart, from the depth of my soul on that night in Korad as I satcross-legged upon my silks while the nearer moon of Barsoom racedthrough the western sky toward the horizon, and lighted up the gold andmarble, and jeweled mosaics of my world-old chamber, and I believe ittoday as I sit at my desk in the little study overlooking the Hudson.Twenty years have intervened; for ten of them I lived and fought forDejah Thoris and her people, and for ten I have lived upon her memory.The morning of our departure for Thark dawned clear and hot, as do allMartian mornings except for the six weeks when the snow melts at thepoles.I sought out Dejah Thoris in the throng of departing chariots, but sheturned her shoulder to me, and I could see the red blood mount to hercheek.  With the foolish inconsistency of love I held my peace when Imight have pled ignorance of the nature of my offense, or at least thegravity of it, and so have effected, at worst, a half conciliation.[Illustration: I sought out Dejah Thoris in the throng of departingchariots.]My duty dictated that I must see that she was comfortable, and so Iglanced into her chariot and rearranged her silks and furs.  In doingso I noted with horror that she was heavily chained by one ankle to theside of the vehicle.&quot;What does this mean?&quot; I cried, turning to Sola.&quot;Sarkoja thought it best,&quot; she answered, her face betokening herdisapproval of the procedure.Examining the manacles I saw that they fastened with a massive springlock.&quot;Where is the key, Sola?  Let me have it.&quot;&quot;Sarkoja wears it, John Carter,&quot; she answered.I turned without further word and sought out Tars Tarkas, to whom Ivehemently objected to the unnecessary humiliations and cruelties, asthey seemed to my lover's eyes, that were being heaped upon DejahThoris.&quot;John Carter,&quot; he answered, &quot;if ever you and Dejah Thoris escape theTharks it will be upon this journey.  We know that you will not gowithout her.  You have shown yourself a mighty fighter, and we do notwish to manacle you, so we hold you both in the easiest way that willyet ensure security.  I have spoken.&quot;I saw the strength of his reasoning at a flash, and knew that it wasfutile to appeal from his decision, but I asked that the key be takenfrom Sarkoja and that she be directed to leave the prisoner alone infuture.&quot;This much, Tars Tarkas, you may do for me in return for the friendshipthat, I must confess, I feel for you.&quot;&quot;Friendship?&quot; he replied.  &quot;There is no such thing, John Carter; buthave your will.  I shall direct that Sarkoja cease to annoy the girl,and I myself will take the custody of the key.&quot;&quot;Unless you wish me to assume the responsibility,&quot; I said, smiling.He looked at me long and earnestly before he spoke.&quot;Were you to give me your word that neither you nor Dejah Thoris wouldattempt to escape until after we have safely reached the court of TalHajus you might have the key and throw the chains into the river Iss.&quot;&quot;It was better that you held the key, Tars Tarkas,&quot; I repliedHe smiled, and said no more, but that night as we were making camp Isaw him unfasten Dejah Thoris' fetters himself.With all his cruel ferocity and coldness there was an undercurrent ofsomething in Tars Tarkas which he seemed ever battling to subdue.Could it be a vestige of some human instinct come back from an ancientforbear to haunt him with the horror of his people's ways!As I was approaching Dejah Thoris' chariot I passed Sarkoja, and theblack, venomous look she accorded me was the sweetest balm I had feltfor many hours.  Lord, how she hated me!  It bristled from her sopalpably that one might almost have cut it with a sword.A few moments later I saw her deep in conversation with a warrior namedZad; a big, hulking, powerful brute, but one who had never made a killamong his own chieftains, and so was still an _o mad_, or man withone name; he could win a second name only with the metal of somechieftain.  It was this custom which entitled me to the names of eitherof the chieftains I had killed; in fact, some of the warriors addressedme as Dotar Sojat, a combination of the surnames of the two warriorchieftains whose metal I had taken, or, in other words, whom I hadslain in fair fight.As Sarkoja talked with Zad he cast occasional glances in my direction,while she seemed to be urging him very strongly to some action.  I paidlittle attention to it at the time, but the next day I had good reasonto recall the circumstances, and at the same time gain a slight insightinto the depths of Sarkoja's hatred and the lengths to which she wascapable of going to wreak her horrid vengeance on me.Dejah Thoris would have none of me again on this evening, and though Ispoke her name she neither replied, nor conceded by so much as theflutter of an eyelid that she realized my existence.  In my extremity Idid what most other lovers would have done; I sought word from herthrough an intimate.  In this instance it was Sola whom I interceptedin another part of camp.&quot;What is the matter with Dejah Thoris?&quot; I blurted out at her.  &quot;Whywill she not speak to me?&quot;Sola seemed puzzled herself, as though such strange actions on the partof two humans were quite beyond her, as indeed they were, poor child.&quot;She says you have angered her, and that is all she will say, exceptthat she is the daughter of a jed and the granddaughter of a jeddak andshe has been humiliated by a creature who could not polish the teeth ofher grandmother's sorak.&quot;I pondered over this report for some time, finally asking, &quot;What mighta sorak be, Sola?&quot;&quot;A little animal about as big as my hand, which the red Martian womenkeep to play with,&quot; explained Sola.Not fit to polish the teeth of her grandmother's cat!  I must rankpretty low in the consideration of Dejah Thoris, I thought; but I couldnot help laughing at the strange figure of speech, so homely and inthis respect so earthly.  It made me homesick, for it sounded very muchlike &quot;not fit to polish her shoes.&quot;  And then commenced a train ofthought quite new to me.  I began to wonder what my people at home weredoing.  I had not seen them for years.  There was a family of Cartersin Virginia who claimed close relationship with me; I was supposed tobe a great uncle, or something of the kind equally foolish.  I couldpass anywhere for twenty-five to thirty years of age, and to be a greatuncle always seemed the height of incongruity, for my thoughts andfeelings were those of a boy.  There were two little kiddies in theCarter family whom I had loved and who had thought there was no one onEarth like Uncle Jack; I could see them just as plainly, as I stoodthere under the moonlit skies of Barsoom, and I longed for them as Ihad never longed for any mortals before.  By nature a wanderer, I hadnever known the true meaning of the word home, but the great hall ofthe Carters had always stood for all that the word did mean to me, andnow my heart turned toward it from the cold and unfriendly peoples Ihad been thrown amongst.  For did not even Dejah Thoris despise me!  Iwas a low creature, so low in fact that I was not even fit to polishthe teeth of her grandmother's cat; and then my saving sense of humorcame to my rescue, and laughing I turned into my silks and furs andslept upon the moon-haunted ground the sleep of a tired and healthyfighting man.We broke camp the next day at an early hour and marched with only asingle halt until just before dark.  Two incidents broke thetediousness of the march.  About noon we espied far to our right whatwas evidently an incubator, and Lorquas Ptomel directed Tars Tarkas toinvestigate it.  The latter took a dozen warriors, including myself,and we raced across the velvety carpeting of moss to the littleenclosure.It was indeed an incubator, but the eggs were very small in comparisonwith those I had seen hatching in ours at the time of my arrival onMars.Tars Tarkas dismounted and examined the enclosure minutely, finallyannouncing that it belonged to the green men of Warhoon and that thecement was scarcely dry where it had been walled up.&quot;They cannot be a day's march ahead of us,&quot; he exclaimed, the light ofbattle leaping to his fierce face.The work at the incubator was short indeed.  The warriors tore open theentrance and a couple of them, crawling in, soon demolished all theeggs with their short-swords.  Then remounting we dashed back to jointhe cavalcade.  During the ride I took occasion to ask Tars Tarkas ifthese Warhoons whose eggs we had destroyed were a smaller people thanhis Tharks.&quot;I noticed that their eggs were so much smaller than those I sawhatching in your incubator,&quot; I added.He explained that the eggs had just been placed there; but, like allgreen Martian eggs, they would grow during the five-year period ofincubation until they obtained the size of those I had seen hatching onthe day of my arrival on Barsoom.  This was indeed an interesting pieceof information, for it had always seemed remarkable to me that thegreen Martian women, large as they were, could bring forth suchenormous eggs as I had seen the four-foot infants emerging from.  As amatter of fact, the new-laid egg is but little larger than an ordinarygoose egg, and as it does not commence to grow until subjected to thelight of the sun the chieftains have little difficulty in transportingseveral hundreds of them at one time from the storage vaults to theincubators.Shortly after the incident of the Warhoon eggs we halted to rest theanimals, and it was during this halt that the second of the day'sinteresting episodes occurred.  I was engaged in changing my ridingcloths from one of my thoats to the other, for I divided the day's workbetween them, when Zad approached me, and without a word struck myanimal a terrific blow with his long-sword.I did not need a manual of green Martian etiquette to know what replyto make, for, in fact, I was so wild with anger that I could scarcelyrefrain from drawing my pistol and shooting him down for the brute hewas; but he stood waiting with drawn long-sword, and my only choice wasto draw my own and meet him in fair fight with his choice of weapons ora lesser one.This latter alternative is always permissible, therefore I could haveused my short-sword, my dagger, my hatchet, or my fists had I wished,and been entirely within my rights, but I could not use firearms or aspear while he held only his long-sword.I chose the same weapon he had drawn because I knew he prided himselfupon his ability with it, and I wished, if I worsted him at all, to doit with his own weapon.  The fight that followed was a long one anddelayed the resumption of the march for an hour.  The entire communitysurrounded us, leaving a clear space about one hundred feet in diameterfor our battle.Zad first attempted to rush me down as a bull might a wolf, but I wasmuch too quick for him, and each time I side-stepped his rushes hewould go lunging past me, only to receive a nick from my sword upon hisarm or back.  He was soon streaming blood from a half dozen minorwounds, but I could not obtain an opening to deliver an effectivethrust.  Then he changed his tactics, and fighting warily and withextreme dexterity, he tried to do by science what he was unable to doby brute strength.  I must admit that he was a magnificent swordsman,and had it not been for my greater endurance and the remarkable agilitythe lesser gravitation of Mars lent me I might not have been able toput up the creditable fight I did against him.We circled for some time without doing much damage on either side; thelong, straight, needle-like swords flashing in the sunlight, andringing out upon the stillness as they crashed together with eacheffective parry.  Finally Zad, realizing that he was tiring more thanI, evidently decided to close in and end the battle in a final blaze ofglory for himself; just as he rushed me a blinding flash of lightstruck full in my eyes, so that I could not see his approach and couldonly leap blindly to one side in an effort to escape the mighty bladethat it seemed I could already feel in my vitals.  I was only partiallysuccessful, as a sharp pain in my left shoulder attested, but in thesweep of my glance as I sought to again locate my adversary, a sightmet my astonished gaze which paid me well for the wound the temporaryblindness had caused me.  There, upon Dejah Thoris' chariot stood threefigures, for the purpose evidently of witnessing the encounter abovethe heads of the intervening Tharks.  There were Dejah Thoris, Sola,and Sarkoja, and as my fleeting glance swept over them a little tableauwas presented which will stand graven in my memory to the day of mydeath.As I looked, Dejah Thoris turned upon Sarkoja with the fury of a youngtigress and struck something from her upraised hand; something whichflashed in the sunlight as it spun to the ground.  Then I knew what hadblinded me at that crucial moment of the fight, and how Sarkoja hadfound a way to kill me without herself delivering the final thrust.Another thing I saw, too, which almost lost my life for me then andthere, for it took my mind for the fraction of an instant entirely frommy antagonist; for, as Dejah Thoris struck the tiny mirror from herhand, Sarkoja, her face livid with hatred and baffled rage, whipped outher dagger and aimed a terrific blow at Dejah Thoris; and then Sola,our dear and faithful Sola, sprang between them; the last I saw was thegreat knife descending upon her shielding breast.My enemy had recovered from his thrust and was making it extremelyinteresting for me, so I reluctantly gave my attention to the work inhand, but my mind was not upon the battle.We rushed each other furiously time after time, 'til suddenly, feelingthe sharp point of his sword at my breast in a thrust I could neitherparry nor escape, I threw myself upon him with outstretched sword andwith all the weight of my body, determined that I would not die aloneif I could prevent it.  I felt the steel tear into my chest, all wentblack before me, my head whirled in dizziness, and I felt my kneesgiving beneath me.CHAPTER XVSOLA TELLS ME HER STORYWhen consciousness returned, and, as I soon learned, I was down but amoment, I sprang quickly to my feet searching for my sword, and there Ifound it, buried to the hilt in the green breast of Zad, who lay stonedead upon the ochre moss of the ancient sea bottom.  As I regained myfull senses I found his weapon piercing my left breast, but onlythrough the flesh and muscles which cover my ribs, entering near thecenter of my chest and coming out below the shoulder.  As I had lungedI had turned so that his sword merely passed beneath the muscles,inflicting a painful but not dangerous wound.Removing the blade from my body I also regained my own, and turning myback upon his ugly carcass, I moved, sick, sore, and disgusted, towardthe chariots which bore my retinue and my belongings.  A murmur ofMartian applause greeted me, but I cared not for it.Bleeding and weak I reached my women, who, accustomed to suchhappenings, dressed my wounds, applying the wonderful healing andremedial agents which make only the most instantaneous of death blowsfatal.  Give a Martian woman a chance and death must take a back seat.They soon had me patched up so that, except for weakness from loss ofblood and a little soreness around the wound, I suffered no greatdistress from this thrust which, under earthly treatment, undoubtedlywould have put me flat on my back for days.As soon as they were through with me I hastened to the chariot of DejahThoris, where I found my poor Sola with her chest swathed in bandages,but apparently little the worse for her encounter with Sarkoja, whosedagger it seemed had struck the edge of one of Sola's metal breastornaments and, thus deflected, had inflicted but a slight flesh wound.As I approached I found Dejah Thoris lying prone upon her silks andfurs, her lithe form wracked with sobs.  She did not notice mypresence, nor did she hear me speaking with Sola, who was standing ashort distance from the vehicle.&quot;Is she injured?&quot; I asked of Sola, indicating Dejah Thoris by aninclination of my head.&quot;No,&quot; she answered, &quot;she thinks that you are dead.&quot;&quot;And that her grandmother's cat may now have no one to polish itsteeth?&quot; I queried, smiling.&quot;I think you wrong her, John Carter,&quot; said Sola.  &quot;I do not understandeither her ways or yours, but I am sure the granddaughter of tenthousand jeddaks would never grieve like this over any who held but thehighest claim upon her affections.  They are a proud race, but they arejust, as are all Barsoomians, and you must have hurt or wronged hergrievously that she will not admit your existence living, though shemourns you dead.&quot;Tears are a strange sight upon Barsoom,&quot; she continued, &quot;and so it isdifficult for me to interpret them.  I have seen but two people weep inall my life, other than Dejah Thoris; one wept from sorrow, the otherfrom baffled rage.  The first was my mother, years ago before theykilled her; the other was Sarkoja, when they dragged her from me today.&quot;&quot;Your mother!&quot; I exclaimed, &quot;but, Sola, you could not have known yourmother, child.&quot;&quot;But I did.  And my father also,&quot; she added.  &quot;If you would like tohear the strange and un-Barsoomian story come to the chariot tonight,John Carter, and I will tell you that of which I have never spoken inall my life before.  And now the signal has been given to resume themarch, you must go.&quot;&quot;I will come tonight, Sola,&quot; I promised.  &quot;Be sure to tell Dejah ThorisI am alive and well.  I shall not force myself upon her, and be surethat you do not let her know I saw her tears.  If she would speak withme I but await her command.&quot;Sola mounted the chariot, which was swinging into its place in line,and I hastened to my waiting thoat and galloped to my station besideTars Tarkas at the rear of the column.We made a most imposing and awe-inspiring spectacle as we strung outacross the yellow landscape; the two hundred and fifty ornate andbrightly colored chariots, preceded by an advance guard of some twohundred mounted warriors and chieftains riding five abreast and onehundred yards apart, and followed by a like number in the sameformation, with a score or more of flankers on either side; the fiftyextra mastodons, or heavy draught animals, known as zitidars, and thefive or six hundred extra thoats of the warriors running loose withinthe hollow square formed by the surrounding warriors.  The gleamingmetal and jewels of the gorgeous ornaments of the men and women,duplicated in the trappings of the zitidars and thoats, andinterspersed with the flashing colors of magnificent silks and furs andfeathers, lent a barbaric splendor to the caravan which would haveturned an East Indian potentate green with envy.The enormous broad tires of the chariots and the padded feet of theanimals brought forth no sound from the moss-covered sea bottom; and sowe moved in utter silence, like some huge phantasmagoria, except whenthe stillness was broken by the guttural growling of a goaded zitidar,or the squealing of fighting thoats.  The green Martians converse butlittle, and then usually in monosyllables, low and like the faintrumbling of distant thunder.We traversed a trackless waste of moss which, bending to the pressureof broad tire or padded foot, rose up again behind us, leaving no signthat we had passed.  We might indeed have been the wraiths of thedeparted dead upon the dead sea of that dying planet for all the soundor sign we made in passing.  It was the first march of a large body ofmen and animals I had ever witnessed which raised no dust and left nospoor; for there is no dust upon Mars except in the cultivateddistricts during the winter months, and even then the absence of highwinds renders it almost unnoticeable.We camped that night at the foot of the hills we had been approachingfor two days and which marked the southern boundary of this particularsea.  Our animals had been two days without drink, nor had they hadwater for nearly two months, not since shortly after leaving Thark;but, as Tars Tarkas explained to me, they require but little and canlive almost indefinitely upon the moss which covers Barsoom, and which,he told me, holds in its tiny stems sufficient moisture to meet thelimited demands of the animals.After partaking of my evening meal of cheese-like food and vegetablemilk I sought out Sola, whom I found working by the light of a torchupon some of Tars Tarkas' trappings.  She looked up at my approach, herface lighting with pleasure and with welcome.&quot;I am glad you came,&quot; she said; &quot;Dejah Thoris sleeps and I am lonely.Mine own people do not care for me, John Carter; I am too unlike them.It is a sad fate, since I must live my life amongst them, and I oftenwish that I were a true green Martian woman, without love and withouthope; but I have known love and so I am lost.&quot;I promised to tell you my story, or rather the story of my parents.From what I have learned of you and the ways of your people I am surethat the tale will not seem strange to you, but among green Martians ithas no parallel within the memory of the oldest living Thark, nor doour legends hold many similar tales.&quot;My mother was rather small, in fact too small to be allowed theresponsibilities of maternity, as our chieftains breed principally forsize.  She was also less cold and cruel than most green Martian women,and caring little for their society, she often roamed the desertedavenues of Thark alone, or went and sat among the wild flowers thatdeck the nearby hills, thinking thoughts and wishing wishes which Ibelieve I alone among Tharkian women today may understand, for am I notthe child of my mother?&quot;And there among the hills she met a young warrior, whose duty it wasto guard the feeding zitidars and thoats and see that they roamed notbeyond the hills.  They spoke at first only of such things as interesta community of Tharks, but gradually, as they came to meet more often,and, as was now quite evident to both, no longer by chance, they talkedabout themselves, their likes, their ambitions and their hopes.  Shetrusted him and told him of the awful repugnance she felt for thecruelties of their kind, for the hideous, loveless lives they must everlead, and then she waited for the storm of denunciation to break fromhis cold, hard lips; but instead he took her in his arms and kissed her.&quot;They kept their love a secret for six long years.  She, my mother, wasof the retinue of the great Tal Hajus, while her lover was a simplewarrior, wearing only his own metal.  Had their defection from thetraditions of the Tharks been discovered both would have paid thepenalty in the great arena before Tal Hajus and the assembled hordes.&quot;The egg from which I came was hidden beneath a great glass vessel uponthe highest and most inaccessible of the partially ruined towers ofancient Thark.  Once each year my mother visited it for the five longyears it lay there in the process of incubation.  She dared not comeoftener, for in the mighty guilt of her conscience she feared that herevery move was watched.  During this period my father gained greatdistinction as a warrior and had taken the metal from severalchieftains.  His love for my mother had never diminished, and his ownambition in life was to reach a point where he might wrest the metalfrom Tal Hajus himself, and thus, as ruler of the Tharks, be free toclaim her as his own, as well as, by the might of his power, protectthe child which otherwise would be quickly dispatched should the truthbecome known.&quot;It was a wild dream, that of wresting the metal from Tal Hajus in fiveshort years, but his advance was rapid, and he soon stood high in thecouncils of Thark.  But one day the chance was lost forever, in so faras it could come in time to save his loved ones, for he was orderedaway upon a long expedition to the ice-clad south, to make war upon thenatives there and despoil them of their furs, for such is the manner ofthe green Barsoomian; he does not labor for what he can wrest in battlefrom others.&quot;He was gone for four years, and when he returned all had been over forthree; for about a year after his departure, and shortly before thetime for the return of an expedition which had gone forth to fetch thefruits of a community incubator, the egg had hatched.  Thereafter mymother continued to keep me in the old tower, visiting me nightly andlavishing upon me the love the community life would have robbed us bothof.  She hoped, upon the return of the expedition from the incubator,to mix me with the other young assigned to the quarters of Tal Hajus,and thus escape the fate which would surely follow discovery of her sinagainst the ancient traditions of the green men.&quot;She taught me rapidly the language and customs of my kind, and onenight she told me the story I have told to you up to this point,impressing upon me the necessity for absolute secrecy and the greatcaution I must exercise after she had placed me with the other youngTharks to permit no one to guess that I was further advanced ineducation than they, nor by any sign to divulge in the presence ofothers my affection for her, or my knowledge of my parentage; and thendrawing me close to her she whispered in my ear the name of my father.&quot;And then a light flashed out upon the darkness of the tower chamber,and there stood Sarkoja, her gleaming, baleful eyes fixed in a frenzyof loathing and contempt upon my mother.  The torrent of hatred andabuse she poured out upon her turned my young heart cold in terror.That she had heard the entire story was apparent, and that she hadsuspected something wrong from my mother's long nightly absences fromher quarters accounted for her presence there on that fateful night.&quot;One thing she had not heard, nor did she know, the whispered name ofmy father.  This was apparent from her repeated demands upon my motherto disclose the name of her partner in sin, but no amount of abuse orthreats could wring this from her, and to save me from needless tortureshe lied, for she told Sarkoja that she alone knew nor would she evertell her child.&quot;With final imprecations, Sarkoja hastened away to Tal Hajus to reporther discovery, and while she was gone my mother, wrapping me in thesilks and furs of her night coverings, so that I was scarcelynoticeable, descended to the streets and ran wildly away toward theoutskirts of the city, in the direction which led to the far south, outtoward the man whose protection she might not claim, but on whose faceshe wished to look once more before she died.&quot;As we neared the city's southern extremity a sound came to us fromacross the mossy flat, from the direction of the only pass through thehills which led to the gates, the pass by which caravans from eithernorth or south or east or west would enter the city.  The sounds weheard were the squealing of thoats and the grumbling of zitidars, withthe occasional clank of arms which announced the approach of a body ofwarriors.  The thought uppermost in her mind was that it was my fatherreturned from his expedition, but the cunning of the Thark held herfrom headlong and precipitate flight to greet him.&quot;Retreating into the shadows of a doorway she awaited the coming of thecavalcade which shortly entered the avenue, breaking its formation andthronging the thoroughfare from wall to wall.  As the head of theprocession passed us the lesser moon swung clear of the overhangingroofs and lit up the scene with all the brilliancy of her wondrouslight.  My mother shrank further back into the friendly shadows, andfrom her hiding place saw that the expedition was not that of myfather, but the returning caravan bearing the young Tharks.  Instantlyher plan was formed, and as a great chariot swung close to our hidingplace she slipped stealthily in upon the trailing tailboard, crouchinglow in the shadow of the high side, straining me to her bosom in afrenzy of love.&quot;She knew, what I did not, that never again after that night would shehold me to her breast, nor was it likely we would ever look upon eachother's face again.  In the confusion of the plaza she mixed me withthe other children, whose guardians during the journey were now free torelinquish their responsibility.  We were herded together into a greatroom, fed by women who had not accompanied the expedition, and the nextday we were parceled out among the retinues of the chieftains.&quot;I never saw my mother after that night.  She was imprisoned by TalHajus, and every effort, including the most horrible and shamefultorture, was brought to bear upon her to wring from her lips the nameof my father; but she remained steadfast and loyal, dying at lastamidst the laughter of Tal Hajus and his chieftains during some awfultorture she was undergoing.&quot;I learned afterwards that she told them that she had killed me to saveme from a like fate at their hands, and that she had thrown my body tothe white apes.  Sarkoja alone disbelieved her, and I feel to this daythat she suspects my true origin, but does not dare expose me, at thepresent, at all events, because she also guesses, I am sure, theidentity of my father.&quot;When he returned from his expedition and learned the story of mymother's fate I was present as Tal Hajus told him; but never by thequiver of a muscle did he betray the slightest emotion; only he did notlaugh as Tal Hajus gleefully described her death struggles.  From thatmoment on he was the cruelest of the cruel, and I am awaiting the daywhen he shall win the goal of his ambition, and feel the carcass of TalHajus beneath his foot, for I am as sure that he but waits theopportunity to wreak a terrible vengeance, and that his great love isas strong in his breast as when it first transfigured him nearly fortyyears ago, as I am that we sit here upon the edge of a world-old oceanwhile sensible people sleep, John Carter.&quot;&quot;And your father, Sola, is he with us now?&quot; I asked.&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied, &quot;but he does not know me for what I am, nor does heknow who betrayed my mother to Tal Hajus.  I alone know my father'sname, and only I and Tal Hajus and Sarkoja know that it was she whocarried the tale that brought death and torture upon her he loved.&quot;We sat silent for a few moments, she wrapped in the gloomy thoughts ofher terrible past, and I in pity for the poor creatures whom theheartless, senseless customs of their race had doomed to loveless livesof cruelty and of hate.  Presently she spoke.&quot;John Carter, if ever a real man walked the cold, dead bosom of Barsoomyou are one.  I know that I can trust you, and because the knowledgemay someday help you or him or Dejah Thoris or myself, I am going totell you the name of my father, nor place any restrictions orconditions upon your tongue.  When the time comes, speak the truth ifit seems best to you.  I trust you because I know that you are notcursed with the terrible trait of absolute and unswerving truthfulness,that you could lie like one of your own Virginia gentlemen if a liewould save others from sorrow or suffering.  My father's name is TarsTarkas.&quot;CHAPTER XVIWE PLAN ESCAPEThe remainder of our journey to Thark was uneventful.  We were twentydays upon the road, crossing two sea bottoms and passing through oraround a number of ruined cities, mostly smaller than Korad.  Twice wecrossed the famous Martian waterways, or canals, so-called by ourearthly astronomers.  When we approached these points a warrior wouldbe sent far ahead with a powerful field glass, and if no great body ofred Martian troops was in sight we would advance as close as possiblewithout chance of being seen and then camp until dark, when we wouldslowly approach the cultivated tract, and, locating one of thenumerous, broad highways which cross these areas at regular intervals,creep silently and stealthily across to the arid lands upon the otherside.  It required five hours to make one of these crossings without asingle halt, and the other consumed the entire night, so that we werejust leaving the confines of the high-walled fields when the sun brokeout upon us.Crossing in the darkness, as we did, I was unable to see but little,except as the nearer moon, in her wild and ceaseless hurtling throughthe Barsoomian heavens, lit up little patches of the landscape fromtime to time, disclosing walled fields and low, rambling buildings,presenting much the appearance of earthly farms.  There were manytrees, methodically arranged, and some of them were of enormous height;there were animals in some of the enclosures, and they announced theirpresence by terrified squealings and snortings as they scented ourqueer, wild beasts and wilder human beings.Only once did I perceive a human being, and that was at theintersection of our crossroad with the wide, white turnpike which cutseach cultivated district longitudinally at its exact center.  Thefellow must have been sleeping beside the road, for, as I came abreastof him, he raised upon one elbow and after a single glance at theapproaching caravan leaped shrieking to his feet and fled madly downthe road, scaling a nearby wall with the agility of a scared cat.  TheTharks paid him not the slightest attention; they were not out upon thewarpath, and the only sign that I had that they had seen him was aquickening of the pace of the caravan as we hastened toward thebordering desert which marked our entrance into the realm of Tal Hajus.Not once did I have speech with Dejah Thoris, as she sent no word to methat I would be welcome at her chariot, and my foolish pride kept mefrom making any advances.  I verily believe that a man's way with womenis in inverse ratio to his prowess among men.  The weakling and thesaphead have often great ability to charm the fair sex, while thefighting man who can face a thousand real dangers unafraid, sits hidingin the shadows like some frightened child.Just thirty days after my advent upon Barsoom we entered the ancientcity of Thark, from whose long-forgotten people this horde of green menhave stolen even their name.  The hordes of Thark number some thirtythousand souls, and are divided into twenty-five communities.  Eachcommunity has its own jed and lesser chieftains, but all are under therule of Tal Hajus, Jeddak of Thark.  Five communities make theirheadquarters at the city of Thark, and the balance are scattered amongother deserted cities of ancient Mars throughout the district claimedby Tal Hajus.We made our entry into the great central plaza early in the afternoon.There were no enthusiastic friendly greetings for the returnedexpedition.  Those who chanced to be in sight spoke the names ofwarriors or women with whom they came in direct contact, in the formalgreeting of their kind, but when it was discovered that they broughttwo captives a greater interest was aroused, and Dejah Thoris and Iwere the centers of inquiring groups.We were soon assigned to new quarters, and the balance of the day wasdevoted to settling ourselves to the changed conditions.  My home nowwas upon an avenue leading into the plaza from the south, the mainartery down which we had marched from the gates of the city.  I was atthe far end of the square and had an entire building to myself.  Thesame grandeur of architecture which was so noticeable a characteristicof Korad was in evidence here, only, if that were possible, on a largerand richer scale.  My quarters would have been suitable for housing thegreatest of earthly emperors, but to these queer creatures nothingabout a building appealed to them but its size and the enormity of itschambers; the larger the building, the more desirable; and so Tal Hajusoccupied what must have been an enormous public building, the largestin the city, but entirely unfitted for residence purposes; the nextlargest was reserved for Lorquas Ptomel, the next for the jed of alesser rank, and so on to the bottom of the list of five jeds.  Thewarriors occupied the buildings with the chieftains to whose retinuesthey belonged; or, if they preferred, sought shelter among any of thethousands of untenanted buildings in their own quarter of town; eachcommunity being assigned a certain section of the city.  The selectionof building had to be made in accordance with these divisions, exceptin so far as the jeds were concerned, they all occupying edifices whichfronted upon the plaza.When I had finally put my house in order, or rather seen that it hadbeen done, it was nearing sunset, and I hastened out with the intentionof locating Sola and her charges, as I had determined upon havingspeech with Dejah Thoris and trying to impress on her the necessity ofour at least patching up a truce until I could find some way of aidingher to escape.  I searched in vain until the upper rim of the great redsun was just disappearing behind the horizon and then I spied the uglyhead of Woola peering from a second-story window on the opposite sideof the very street where I was quartered, but nearer the plaza.Without waiting for a further invitation I bolted up the winding runwaywhich led to the second floor, and entering a great chamber at thefront of the building was greeted by the frenzied Woola, who threw hisgreat carcass upon me, nearly hurling me to the floor; the poor oldfellow was so glad to see me that I thought he would devour me, hishead split from ear to ear, showing his three rows of tusks in hishobgoblin smile.Quieting him with a word of command and a caress, I looked hurriedlythrough the approaching gloom for a sign of Dejah Thoris, and then, notseeing her, I called her name.  There was an answering murmur from thefar corner of the apartment, and with a couple of quick strides I wasstanding beside her where she crouched among the furs and silks upon anancient carved wooden seat.  As I waited she rose to her full heightand looking me straight in the eye said:&quot;What would Dotar Sojat, Thark, of Dejah Thoris his captive?&quot;&quot;Dejah Thoris, I do not know how I have angered you.  It was furtherestfrom my desire to hurt or offend you, whom I had hoped to protect andcomfort.  Have none of me if it is your will, but that you must aid mein effecting your escape, if such a thing be possible, is not myrequest, but my command.  When you are safe once more at your father'scourt you may do with me as you please, but from now on until that dayI am your master, and you must obey and aid me.&quot;She looked at me long and earnestly and I thought that she wassoftening toward me.&quot;I understand your words, Dotar Sojat,&quot; she replied, &quot;but you I do notunderstand.  You are a queer mixture of child and man, of brute andnoble.  I only wish that I might read your heart.&quot;&quot;Look down at your feet, Dejah Thoris; it lies there now where it haslain since that other night at Korad, and where it will ever liebeating alone for you until death stills it forever.&quot;She took a little step toward me, her beautiful hands outstretched in astrange, groping gesture.&quot;What do you mean, John Carter?&quot; she whispered.  &quot;What are you sayingto me?&quot;&quot;I am saying what I had promised myself that I would not say to you, atleast until you were no longer a captive among the green men; what fromyour attitude toward me for the past twenty days I had thought never tosay to you; I am saying, Dejah Thoris, that I am yours, body and soul,to serve you, to fight for you, and to die for you.  Only one thing Iask of you in return, and that is that you make no sign, either ofcondemnation or of approbation of my words until you are safe amongyour own people, and that whatever sentiments you harbor toward me theybe not influenced or colored by gratitude; whatever I may do to serveyou will be prompted solely from selfish motives, since it gives memore pleasure to serve you than not.&quot;&quot;I will respect your wishes, John Carter, because I understand themotives which prompt them, and I accept your service no more willinglythan I bow to your authority; your word shall be my law.  I have twicewronged you in my thoughts and again I ask your forgiveness.&quot;Further conversation of a personal nature was prevented by the entranceof Sola, who was much agitated and wholly unlike her usual calm andpossessed self.&quot;That horrible Sarkoja has been before Tal Hajus,&quot; she cried, &quot;and fromwhat I heard upon the plaza there is little hope for either of you.&quot;&quot;What do they say?&quot; inquired Dejah Thoris.&quot;That you will be thrown to the wild calots [dogs] in the great arenaas soon as the hordes have assembled for the yearly games.&quot;&quot;Sola,&quot; I said, &quot;you are a Thark, but you hate and loathe the customsof your people as much as we do.  Will you not accompany us in onesupreme effort to escape?  I am sure that Dejah Thoris can offer you ahome and protection among her people, and your fate can be no worseamong them than it must ever be here.&quot;&quot;Yes,&quot; cried Dejah Thoris, &quot;come with us, Sola, you will be better offamong the red men of Helium than you are here, and I can promise younot only a home with us, but the love and affection your nature cravesand which must always be denied you by the customs of your own race.Come with us, Sola; we might go without you, but your fate would beterrible if they thought you had connived to aid us.  I know that eventhat fear would not tempt you to interfere in our escape, but we wantyou with us, we want you to come to a land of sunshine and happiness,amongst a people who know the meaning of love, of sympathy, and ofgratitude.  Say that you will, Sola; tell me that you will.&quot;&quot;The great waterway which leads to Helium is but fifty miles to thesouth,&quot; murmured Sola, half to herself; &quot;a swift thoat might make it inthree hours; and then to Helium it is five hundred miles, most of theway through thinly settled districts.  They would know and they wouldfollow us.  We might hide among the great trees for a time, but thechances are small indeed for escape.  They would follow us to the verygates of Helium, and they would take toll of life at every step; you donot know them.&quot;&quot;Is there no other way we might reach Helium?&quot; I asked.  &quot;Can you notdraw me a rough map of the country we must traverse, Dejah Thoris?&quot;&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied, and taking a great diamond from her hair she drewupon the marble floor the first map of Barsoomian territory I had everseen.  It was crisscrossed in every direction with long straight lines,sometimes running parallel and sometimes converging toward some greatcircle.  The lines, she said, were waterways; the circles, cities; andone far to the northwest of us she pointed out as Helium.  There wereother cities closer, but she said she feared to enter many of them, asthey were not all friendly toward Helium.[Illustration: She drew upon the marble floor the first map of theBarsoomian territory I had ever seen.]Finally, after studying the map carefully in the moonlight which nowflooded the room, I pointed out a waterway far to the north of us whichalso seemed to lead to Helium.&quot;Does not this pierce your grandfather's territory?&quot; I asked.&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered, &quot;but it is two hundred miles north of us; it isone of the waterways we crossed on the trip to Thark.&quot;&quot;They would never suspect that we would try for that distant waterway,&quot;I answered, &quot;and that is why I think that it is the best route for ourescape.&quot;Sola agreed with me, and it was decided that we should leave Thark thissame night; just as quickly, in fact, as I could find and saddle mythoats.  Sola was to ride one and Dejah Thoris and I the other; each ofus carrying sufficient food and drink to last us for two days, sincethe animals could not be urged too rapidly for so long a distance.I directed Sola to proceed with Dejah Thoris along one of the lessfrequented avenues to the southern boundary of the city, where I wouldovertake them with the thoats as quickly as possible; then, leavingthem to gather what food, silks, and furs we were to need, I slippedquietly to the rear of the first floor, and entered the courtyard,where our animals were moving restlessly about, as was their habit,before settling down for the night.In the shadows of the buildings and out beneath the radiance of theMartian moons moved the great herd of thoats and zitidars, the lattergrunting their low gutturals and the former occasionally emitting thesharp squeal which denotes the almost habitual state of rage in whichthese creatures passed their existence.  They were quieter now, owingto the absence of man, but as they scented me they became more restlessand their hideous noise increased.  It was risky business, thisentering a paddock of thoats alone and at night; first, because theirincreasing noisiness might warn the nearby warriors that something wasamiss, and also because for the slightest cause, or for no cause at allsome great bull thoat might take it upon himself to lead a charge uponme.Having no desire to awaken their nasty tempers upon such a night asthis, where so much depended upon secrecy and dispatch, I hugged theshadows of the buildings, ready at an instant's warning to leap intothe safety of a nearby door or window.  Thus I moved silently to thegreat gates which opened upon the street at the back of the court, andas I neared the exit I called softly to my two animals.  How I thankedthe kind providence which had given me the foresight to win the loveand confidence of these wild dumb brutes, for presently from the farside of the court I saw two huge bulks forcing their way toward methrough the surging mountains of flesh.They came quite close to me, rubbing their muzzles against my body andnosing for the bits of food it was always my practice to reward themwith.  Opening the gates I ordered the two great beasts to pass out,and then slipping quietly after them I closed the portals behind me.I did not saddle or mount the animals there, but instead walked quietlyin the shadows of the buildings toward an unfrequented avenue which ledtoward the point I had arranged to meet Dejah Thoris and Sola.  Withthe noiselessness of disembodied spirits we moved stealthily along thedeserted streets, but not until we were within sight of the plainbeyond the city did I commence to breathe freely.  I was sure that Solaand Dejah Thoris would find no difficulty in reaching our rendezvousundetected, but with my great thoats I was not so sure for myself, asit was quite unusual for warriors to leave the city after dark; in factthere was no place for them to go within any but a long ride.I reached the appointed meeting place safely, but as Dejah Thoris andSola were not there I led my animals into the entrance hall of one ofthe large buildings.  Presuming that one of the other women of the samehousehold may have come in to speak to Sola, and so delayed theirdeparture, I did not feel any undue apprehension until nearly an hourhad passed without a sign of them, and by the time another half hourhad crawled away I was becoming filled with grave anxiety.  Then therebroke upon the stillness of the night the sound of an approachingparty, which, from the noise, I knew could be no fugitives creepingstealthily toward liberty.  Soon the party was near me, and from theblack shadows of my entranceway I perceived a score of mountedwarriors, who, in passing, dropped a dozen words that fetched my heartclean into the top of my head.&quot;He would likely have arranged to meet them just without the city, andso--&quot;  I heard no more, they had passed on; but it was enough.  Ourplan had been discovered, and the chances for escape from now on to thefearful end would be small indeed.  My one hope now was to returnundetected to the quarters of Dejah Thoris and learn what fate hadovertaken her, but how to do it with these great monstrous thoats uponmy hands, now that the city probably was aroused by the knowledge of myescape was a problem of no mean proportions.Suddenly an idea occurred to me, and acting on my knowledge of theconstruction of the buildings of these ancient Martian cities with ahollow court within the center of each square, I groped my way blindlythrough the dark chambers, calling the great thoats after me.  They haddifficulty in negotiating some of the doorways, but as the buildingsfronting the city's principal exposures were all designed upon amagnificent scale, they were able to wriggle through without stickingfast; and thus we finally made the inner court where I found, as I hadexpected, the usual carpet of moss-like vegetation which would provetheir food and drink until I could return them to their own enclosure.That they would be as quiet and contented here as elsewhere I wasconfident, nor was there but the remotest possibility that they wouldbe discovered, as the green men had no great desire to enter theseoutlying buildings, which were frequented by the only thing, I believe,which caused them the sensation of fear--the great white apes ofBarsoom.Removing the saddle trappings, I hid them just within the rear doorwayof the building through which we had entered the court, and, turningthe beasts loose, quickly made my way across the court to the rear ofthe buildings upon the further side, and thence to the avenue beyond.Waiting in the doorway of the building until I was assured that no onewas approaching, I hurried across to the opposite side and through thefirst doorway to the court beyond; thus, crossing through court aftercourt with only the slight chance of detection which the necessarycrossing of the avenues entailed, I made my way in safety to thecourtyard in the rear of Dejah Thoris' quarters.Here, of course, I found the beasts of the warriors who quartered inthe adjacent buildings, and the warriors themselves I might expect tomeet within if I entered; but, fortunately for me, I had another andsafer method of reaching the upper story where Dejah Thoris should befound, and, after first determining as nearly as possible which of thebuildings she occupied, for I had never observed them before from thecourt side, I took advantage of my relatively great strength andagility and sprang upward until I grasped the sill of a second-storywindow which I thought to be in the rear of her apartment.  Drawingmyself inside the room I moved stealthily toward the front of thebuilding, and not until I had quite reached the doorway of her room wasI made aware by voices that it was occupied.I did not rush headlong in, but listened without to assure myself thatit was Dejah Thoris and that it was safe to venture within.  It waswell indeed that I took this precaution, for the conversation I heardwas in the low gutturals of men, and the words which finally came to meproved a most timely warning.  The speaker was a chieftain and he wasgiving orders to four of his warriors.&quot;And when he returns to this chamber,&quot; he was saying, &quot;as he surelywill when he finds she does not meet him at the city's edge, you fourare to spring upon him and disarm him.  It will require the combinedstrength of all of you to do it if the reports they bring back fromKorad are correct.  When you have him fast bound bear him to the vaultsbeneath the jeddak's quarters and chain him securely where he may befound when Tal Hajus wishes him.  Allow him to speak with none, norpermit any other to enter this apartment before he comes.  There willbe no danger of the girl returning, for by this time she is safe in thearms of Tal Hajus, and may all her ancestors have pity upon her, forTal Hajus will have none; the great Sarkoja has done a noble night'swork.  I go, and if you fail to capture him when he comes, I commendyour carcasses to the cold bosom of Iss.&quot;CHAPTER XVIIA COSTLY RECAPTUREAs the speaker ceased he turned to leave the apartment by the doorwhere I was standing, but I needed to wait no longer; I had heardenough to fill my soul with dread, and stealing quietly away I returnedto the courtyard by the way I had come.  My plan of action was formedupon the instant, and crossing the square and the bordering avenue uponthe opposite side I soon stood within the courtyard of Tal Hajus.The brilliantly lighted apartments of the first floor told me wherefirst to seek, and advancing to the windows I peered within.  I soondiscovered that my approach was not to be the easy thing I had hoped,for the rear rooms bordering the court were filled with warriors andwomen.  I then glanced up at the stories above, discovering that thethird was apparently unlighted, and so decided to make my entrance tothe building from that point.  It was the work of but a moment for meto reach the windows above, and soon I had drawn myself within thesheltering shadows of the unlighted third floor.Fortunately the room I had selected was untenanted, and creepingnoiselessly to the corridor beyond I discovered a light in theapartments ahead of me.  Reaching what appeared to be a doorway Idiscovered that it was but an opening upon an immense inner chamberwhich towered from the first floor, two stories below me, to thedome-like roof of the building, high above my head.  The floor of thisgreat circular hall was thronged with chieftains, warriors and women,and at one end was a great raised platform upon which squatted the mosthideous beast I had ever put my eyes upon.  He had all the cold, hard,cruel, terrible features of the green warriors, but accentuated anddebased by the animal passions to which he had given himself over formany years.  There was not a mark of dignity or pride upon his bestialcountenance, while his enormous bulk spread itself out upon theplatform where he squatted like some huge devil fish, his six limbsaccentuating the similarity in a horrible and startling manner.But the sight that froze me with apprehension was that of Dejah Thorisand Sola standing there before him, and the fiendish leer of him as helet his great protruding eyes gloat upon the lines of her beautifulfigure.  She was speaking, but I could not hear what she said, norcould I make out the low grumbling of his reply.  She stood there erectbefore him, her head high held, and even at the distance I was fromthem I could read the scorn and disgust upon her face as she let herhaughty glance rest without sign of fear upon him.  She was indeed theproud daughter of a thousand jeddaks, every inch of her dear, preciouslittle body; so small, so frail beside the towering warriors aroundher, but in her majesty dwarfing them into insignificance; she was themightiest figure among them and I verily believe that they felt it.Presently Tal Hajus made a sign that the chamber be cleared, and thatthe prisoners be left alone before him.  Slowly the chieftains, thewarriors and the women melted away into the shadows of the surroundingchambers, and Dejah Thoris and Sola stood alone before the jeddak ofthe Tharks.One chieftain alone had hesitated before departing; I saw him standingin the shadows of a mighty column, his fingers nervously toying withthe hilt of his great-sword and his cruel eyes bent in implacablehatred upon Tal Hajus.  It was Tars Tarkas, and I could read histhoughts as they were an open book for the undisguised loathing uponhis face.  He was thinking of that other woman who, forty years ago,had stood before this beast, and could I have spoken a word into hisear at that moment the reign of Tal Hajus would have been over; butfinally he also strode from the room, not knowing that he left his owndaughter at the mercy of the creature he most loathed.Tal Hajus arose, and I, half fearing, half anticipating his intentions,hurried to the winding runway which led to the floors below.  No onewas near to intercept me, and I reached the main floor of the chamberunobserved, taking my station in the shadow of the same column thatTars Tarkas had but just deserted.  As I reached the floor Tal Hajuswas speaking.&quot;Princess of Helium, I might wring a mighty ransom from your peoplewould I but return you to them unharmed, but a thousand times ratherwould I watch that beautiful face writhe in the agony of torture; itshall be long drawn out, that I promise you; ten days of pleasure wereall too short to show the love I harbor for your race.  The terrors ofyour death shall haunt the slumbers of the red men through all the agesto come; they will shudder in the shadows of the night as their fatherstell them of the awful vengeance of the green men; of the power andmight and hate and cruelty of Tal Hajus.  But before the torture youshall be mine for one short hour, and word of that too shall go forthto Tardos Mors, Jeddak of Helium, your grandfather, that he may grovelupon the ground in the agony of his sorrow.  Tomorrow the torture willcommence; tonight thou art Tal Hajus'; come!&quot;He sprang down from the platform and grasped her roughly by the arm,but scarcely had he touched her than I leaped between them.  Myshort-sword, sharp and gleaming was in my right hand; I could haveplunged it into his putrid heart before he realized that I was uponhim; but as I raised my arm to strike I thought of Tars Tarkas, and,with all my rage, with all my hatred, I could not rob him of that sweetmoment for which he had lived and hoped all these long, weary years,and so, instead, I swung my good right fist full upon the point of hisjaw.  Without a sound he slipped to the floor as one dead.In the same deathly silence I grasped Dejah Thoris by the hand, andmotioning Sola to follow we sped noiselessly from the chamber and tothe floor above.  Unseen we reached a rear window and with the strapsand leather of my trappings I lowered, first Sola and then Dejah Thoristo the ground below.  Dropping lightly after them I drew them rapidlyaround the court in the shadows of the buildings, and thus we returnedover the same course I had so recently followed from the distantboundary of the city.We finally came upon my thoats in the courtyard where I had left them,and placing the trappings upon them we hastened through the building tothe avenue beyond.  Mounting, Sola upon one beast, and Dejah Thorisbehind me upon the other, we rode from the city of Thark through thehills to the south.Instead of circling back around the city to the northwest and towardthe nearest waterway which lay so short a distance from us, we turnedto the northeast and struck out upon the mossy waste across which, fortwo hundred dangerous and weary miles, lay another main artery leadingto Helium.No word was spoken until we had left the city far behind, but I couldhear the quiet sobbing of Dejah Thoris as she clung to me with her dearhead resting against my shoulder.&quot;If we make it, my chieftain, the debt of Helium will be a mighty one;greater than she can ever pay you; and should we not make it,&quot; shecontinued, &quot;the debt is no less, though Helium will never know, for youhave saved the last of our line from worse than death.&quot;I did not answer, but instead reached to my side and pressed the littlefingers of her I loved where they clung to me for support, and then, inunbroken silence, we sped over the yellow, moonlit moss; each of usoccupied with his own thoughts.  For my part I could not be other thanjoyful had I tried, with Dejah Thoris' warm body pressed close to mine,and with all our unpassed danger my heart was singing as gaily asthough we were already entering the gates of Helium.Our earlier plans had been so sadly upset that we now found ourselveswithout food or drink, and I alone was armed.  We therefore urged ourbeasts to a speed that must tell on them sorely before we could hope tosight the ending of the first stage of our journey.We rode all night and all the following day with only a few shortrests.  On the second night both we and our animals were completelyfagged, and so we lay down upon the moss and slept for some five or sixhours, taking up the journey once more before daylight.  All thefollowing day we rode, and when, late in the afternoon we had sightedno distant trees, the mark of the great waterways throughout allBarsoom, the terrible truth flashed upon us--we were lost.Evidently we had circled, but which way it was difficult to say, nordid it seem possible with the sun to guide us by day and the moons andstars by night.  At any rate no waterway was in sight, and the entireparty was almost ready to drop from hunger, thirst and fatigue.  Farahead of us and a trifle to the right we could distinguish the outlinesof low mountains.  These we decided to attempt to reach in the hopethat from some ridge we might discern the missing waterway.  Night fellupon us before we reached our goal, and, almost fainting from wearinessand weakness, we lay down and slept.I was awakened early in the morning by some huge body pressing close tomine, and opening my eyes with a start I beheld my blessed old Woolasnuggling close to me; the faithful brute had followed us across thattrackless waste to share our fate, whatever it might be.  Putting myarms about his neck I pressed my cheek close to his, nor am I ashamedthat I did it, nor of the tears that came to my eyes as I thought ofhis love for me.  Shortly after this Dejah Thoris and Sola awakened,and it was decided that we push on at once in an effort to gain thehills.We had gone scarcely a mile when I noticed that my thoat was commencingto stumble and stagger in a most pitiful manner, although we had notattempted to force them out of a walk since about noon of the precedingday.  Suddenly he lurched wildly to one side and pitched violently tothe ground.  Dejah Thoris and I were thrown clear of him and fell uponthe soft moss with scarcely a jar; but the poor beast was in a pitiablecondition, not even being able to rise, although relieved of ourweight.  Sola told me that the coolness of the night, when it fell,together with the rest would doubtless revive him, and so I decided notto kill him, as was my first intention, as I had thought it cruel toleave him alone there to die of hunger and thirst.  Relieving him ofhis trappings, which I flung down beside him, we left the poor fellowto his fate, and pushed on with the one thoat as best we could.  Solaand I walked, making Dejah Thoris ride, much against her will.  In thisway we had progressed to within about a mile of the hills we wereendeavoring to reach when Dejah Thoris, from her point of vantage uponthe thoat, cried out that she saw a great party of mounted men filingdown from a pass in the hills several miles away.  Sola and I bothlooked in the direction she indicated, and there, plainly discernible,were several hundred mounted warriors.  They seemed to be headed in asouthwesterly direction, which would take them away from us.They doubtless were Thark warriors who had been sent out to capture us,and we breathed a great sigh of relief that they were traveling in theopposite direction.  Quickly lifting Dejah Thoris from the thoat, Icommanded the animal to lie down and we three did the same, presentingas small an object as possible for fear of attracting the attention ofthe warriors toward us.We could see them as they filed out of the pass, just for an instant,before they were lost to view behind a friendly ridge; to us a mostprovidential ridge; since, had they been in view for any great lengthof time, they scarcely could have failed to discover us.  As whatproved to be the last warrior came into view from the pass, he haltedand, to our consternation, threw his small but powerful fieldglass tohis eye and scanned the sea bottom in all directions.  Evidently he wasa chieftain, for in certain marching formations among the green men achieftain brings up the extreme rear of the column.  As his glass swungtoward us our hearts stopped in our breasts, and I could feel the coldsweat start from every pore in my body.Presently it swung full upon us and--stopped.  The tension on ournerves was near the breaking point, and I doubt if any of us breathedfor the few moments he held us covered by his glass; and then helowered it and we could see him shout a command to the warriors who hadpassed from our sight behind the ridge.  He did not wait for them tojoin him, however, instead he wheeled his thoat and came tearing madlyin our direction.There was but one slight chance and that we must take quickly.  Raisingmy strange Martian rifle to my shoulder I sighted and touched thebutton which controlled the trigger; there was a sharp explosion as themissile reached its goal, and the charging chieftain pitched backwardfrom his flying mount.Springing to my feet I urged the thoat to rise, and directed Sola totake Dejah Thoris with her upon him and make a mighty effort to reachthe hills before the green warriors were upon us.  I knew that in theravines and gullies they might find a temporary hiding place, and eventhough they died there of hunger and thirst it would be better so thanthat they fell into the hands of the Tharks.  Forcing my two revolversupon them as a slight means of protection, and, as a last resort, as anescape for themselves from the horrid death which recapture wouldsurely mean, I lifted Dejah Thoris in my arms and placed her upon thethoat behind Sola, who had already mounted at my command.&quot;Good-bye, my princess,&quot; I whispered, &quot;we may meet in Helium yet.  Ihave escaped from worse plights than this,&quot; and I tried to smile as Ilied.&quot;What,&quot; she cried, &quot;are you not coming with us?&quot;&quot;How may I, Dejah Thoris?  Someone must hold these fellows off for awhile, and I can better escape them alone than could the three of ustogether.&quot;She sprang quickly from the thoat and, throwing her dear arms about myneck, turned to Sola, saying with quiet dignity: &quot;Fly, Sola!  DejahThoris remains to die with the man she loves.&quot;Those words are engraved upon my heart.  Ah, gladly would I give up mylife a thousand times could I only hear them once again; but I couldnot then give even a second to the rapture of her sweet embrace, andpressing my lips to hers for the first time, I picked her up bodily andtossed her to her seat behind Sola again, commanding the latter inperemptory tones to hold her there by force, and then, slapping thethoat upon the flank, I saw them borne away; Dejah Thoris struggling tothe last to free herself from Sola's grasp.Turning, I beheld the green warriors mounting the ridge and looking fortheir chieftain.  In a moment they saw him, and then me; but scarcelyhad they discovered me than I commenced firing, lying flat upon mybelly in the moss.  I had an even hundred rounds in the magazine of myrifle, and another hundred in the belt at my back, and I kept up acontinuous stream of fire until I saw all of the warriors who had beenfirst to return from behind the ridge either dead or scurrying to cover.My respite was short-lived however, for soon the entire party,numbering some thousand men, came charging into view, racing madlytoward me.  I fired until my rifle was empty and they were almost uponme, and then a glance showing me that Dejah Thoris and Sola haddisappeared among the hills, I sprang up, throwing down my useless gun,and started away in the direction opposite to that taken by Sola andher charge.If ever Martians had an exhibition of jumping, it was granted thoseastonished warriors on that day long years ago, but while it led themaway from Dejah Thoris it did not distract their attention fromendeavoring to capture me.They raced wildly after me until, finally, my foot struck a projectingpiece of quartz, and down I went sprawling upon the moss.  As I lookedup they were upon me, and although I drew my long-sword in an attemptto sell my life as dearly as possible, it was soon over.  I reeledbeneath their blows which fell upon me in perfect torrents; my headswam; all was black, and I went down beneath them to oblivion.CHAPTER XVIIICHAINED IN WARHOONIt must have been several hours before I regained consciousness and Iwell remember the feeling of surprise which swept over me as I realizedthat I was not dead.I was lying among a pile of sleeping silks and furs in the corner of asmall room in which were several green warriors, and bending over mewas an ancient and ugly female.As I opened my eyes she turned to one of the warriors, saying,&quot;He will live, O Jed.&quot;&quot;'Tis well,&quot; replied the one so addressed, rising and approaching mycouch, &quot;he should render rare sport for the great games.&quot;And now as my eyes fell upon him, I saw that he was no Thark, for hisornaments and metal were not of that horde.  He was a huge fellow,terribly scarred about the face and chest, and with one broken tusk anda missing ear.  Strapped on either breast were human skulls anddepending from these a number of dried human hands.His reference to the great games of which I had heard so much whileamong the Tharks convinced me that I had but jumped from purgatory intogehenna.After a few more words with the female, during which she assured himthat I was now fully fit to travel, the jed ordered that we mount andride after the main column.I was strapped securely to as wild and unmanageable a thoat as I hadever seen, and, with a mounted warrior on either side to prevent thebeast from bolting, we rode forth at a furious pace in pursuit of thecolumn.  My wounds gave me but little pain, so wonderfully and rapidlyhad the applications and injections of the female exercised theirtherapeutic powers, and so deftly had she bound and plastered theinjuries.Just before dark we reached the main body of troops shortly after theyhad made camp for the night.  I was immediately taken before theleader, who proved to be the jeddak of the hordes of Warhoon.Like the jed who had brought me, he was frightfully scarred, and alsodecorated with the breastplate of human skulls and dried dead handswhich seemed to mark all the greater warriors among the Warhoons, aswell as to indicate their awful ferocity, which greatly transcends eventhat of the Tharks.The jeddak, Bar Comas, who was comparatively young, was the object ofthe fierce and jealous hatred of his old lieutenant, Dak Kova, the jedwho had captured me, and I could not but note the almost studiedefforts which the latter made to affront his superior.He entirely omitted the usual formal salutation as we entered thepresence of the jeddak, and as he pushed me roughly before the ruler heexclaimed in a loud and menacing voice.&quot;I have brought a strange creature wearing the metal of a Thark whom itis my pleasure to have battle with a wild thoat at the great games.&quot;&quot;He will die as Bar Comas, your jeddak, sees fit, if at all,&quot; repliedthe young ruler, with emphasis and dignity.&quot;If at all?&quot; roared Dak Kova.  &quot;By the dead hands at my throat but heshall die, Bar Comas.  No maudlin weakness on your part shall save him.O, would that Warhoon were ruled by a real jeddak rather than by awater-hearted weakling from whom even old Dak Kova could tear the metalwith his bare hands!&quot;Bar Comas eyed the defiant and insubordinate chieftain for an instant,his expression one of haughty, fearless contempt and hate, and thenwithout drawing a weapon and without uttering a word he hurled himselfat the throat of his defamer.I never before had seen two green Martian warriors battle with nature'sweapons and the exhibition of animal ferocity which ensued was asfearful a thing as the most disordered imagination could picture.  Theytore at each others' eyes and ears with their hands and with theirgleaming tusks repeatedly slashed and gored until both were cut fairlyto ribbons from head to foot.Bar Comas had much the better of the battle as he was stronger, quickerand more intelligent.  It soon seemed that the encounter was donesaving only the final death thrust when Bar Comas slipped in breakingaway from a clinch.  It was the one little opening that Dak Kovaneeded, and hurling himself at the body of his adversary he buried hissingle mighty tusk in Bar Comas' groin and with a last powerful effortripped the young jeddak wide open the full length of his body, thegreat tusk finally wedging in the bones of Bar Comas' jaw.  Victor andvanquished rolled limp and lifeless upon the moss, a huge mass of tornand bloody flesh.Bar Comas was stone dead, and only the most herculean efforts on thepart of Dak Kova's females saved him from the fate he deserved.  Threedays later he walked without assistance to the body of Bar Comas which,by custom, had not been moved from where it fell, and placing his footupon the neck of his erstwhile ruler he assumed the title of Jeddak ofWarhoon.The dead jeddak's hands and head were removed to be added to theornaments of his conqueror, and then his women cremated what remained,amid wild and terrible laughter.The injuries to Dak Kova had delayed the march so greatly that it wasdecided to give up the expedition, which was a raid upon a small Tharkcommunity in retaliation for the destruction of the incubator, untilafter the great games, and the entire body of warriors, ten thousand innumber, turned back toward Warhoon.My introduction to these cruel and bloodthirsty people was but an indexto the scenes I witnessed almost daily while with them.  They are asmaller horde than the Tharks but much more ferocious.  Not a daypassed but that some members of the various Warhoon communities met indeadly combat.  I have seen as high as eight mortal duels within asingle day.We reached the city of Warhoon after some three days march and I wasimmediately cast into a dungeon and heavily chained to the floor andwalls.  Food was brought me at intervals but owing to the utterdarkness of the place I do not know whether I lay there days, or weeks,or months.  It was the most horrible experience of all my life and thatmy mind did not give way to the terrors of that inky blackness has beena wonder to me ever since.  The place was filled with creeping,crawling things; cold, sinuous bodies passed over me when I lay down,and in the darkness I occasionally caught glimpses of gleaming, fieryeyes, fixed in horrible intentness upon me.  No sound reached me fromthe world above and no word would my jailer vouchsafe when my food wasbrought to me, although I at first bombarded him with questions.Finally all the hatred and maniacal loathing for these awful creatureswho had placed me in this horrible place was centered by my totteringreason upon this single emissary who represented to me the entire hordeof Warhoons.I had noticed that he always advanced with his dim torch to where hecould place the food within my reach and as he stooped to place it uponthe floor his head was about on a level with my breast.  So, with thecunning of a madman, I backed into the far corner of my cell when nextI heard him approaching and gathering a little slack of the great chainwhich held me in my hand I waited his coming, crouching like some beastof prey.  As he stooped to place my food upon the ground I swung thechain above my head and crashed the links with all my strength upon hisskull.  Without a sound he slipped to the floor, stone dead.Laughing and chattering like the idiot I was fast becoming I fell uponhis prostrate form my fingers feeling for his dead throat.  Presentlythey came in contact with a small chain at the end of which dangled anumber of keys.  The touch of my fingers on these keys brought back myreason with the suddenness of thought.  No longer was I a jibberingidiot, but a sane, reasoning man with the means of escape within myvery hands.As I was groping to remove the chain from about my victim's neck Iglanced up into the darkness to see six pairs of gleaming eyes fixed,unwinking, upon me.  Slowly they approached and slowly I shrank backfrom the awful horror of them.  Back into my corner I crouched holdingmy hands palms out, before me, and stealthily on came the awful eyesuntil they reached the dead body at my feet.  Then slowly theyretreated but this time with a strange grating sound and finally theydisappeared in some black and distant recess of my dungeon.CHAPTER XIXBATTLING IN THE ARENASlowly I regained my composure and finally essayed again to attempt toremove the keys from the dead body of my former jailer.  But as Ireached out into the darkness to locate it I found to my horror that itwas gone.  Then the truth flashed on me; the owners of those gleamingeyes had dragged my prize away from me to be devoured in theirneighboring lair; as they had been waiting for days, for weeks, formonths, through all this awful eternity of my imprisonment to drag mydead carcass to their feast.For two days no food was brought me, but then a new messenger appearedand my incarceration went on as before, but not again did I allow myreason to be submerged by the horror of my position.Shortly after this episode another prisoner was brought in and chainednear me.  By the dim torch light I saw that he was a red Martian and Icould scarcely await the departure of his guards to address him.  Astheir retreating footsteps died away in the distance, I called outsoftly the Martian word of greeting, kaor.&quot;Who are you who speaks out of the darkness?&quot; he answered&quot;John Carter, a friend of the red men of Helium.&quot;&quot;I am of Helium,&quot; he said, &quot;but I do not recall your name.&quot;And then I told him my story as I have written it here, omitting onlyany reference to my love for Dejah Thoris.  He was much excited by thenews of Helium's princess and seemed quite positive that she and Solacould easily have reached a point of safety from where they left me.He said that he knew the place well because the defile through whichthe Warhoon warriors had passed when they discovered us was the onlyone ever used by them when marching to the south.&quot;Dejah Thoris and Sola entered the hills not five miles from a greatwaterway and are now probably quite safe,&quot; he assured me.My fellow prisoner was Kantos Kan, a padwar (lieutenant) in the navy ofHelium.  He had been a member of the ill-fated expedition which hadfallen into the hands of the Tharks at the time of Dejah Thoris'capture, and he briefly related the events which followed the defeat ofthe battleships.Badly injured and only partially manned they had limped slowly towardHelium, but while passing near the city of Zodanga, the capital ofHelium's hereditary enemies among the red men of Barsoom, they had beenattacked by a great body of war vessels and all but the craft to whichKantos Kan belonged were either destroyed or captured.  His vessel waschased for days by three of the Zodangan war ships but finally escapedduring the darkness of a moonless night.Thirty days after the capture of Dejah Thoris, or about the time of ourcoming to Thark, his vessel had reached Helium with about ten survivorsof the original crew of seven hundred officers and men.  Immediatelyseven great fleets, each of one hundred mighty war ships, had beendispatched to search for Dejah Thoris, and from these vessels twothousand smaller craft had been kept out continuously in futile searchfor the missing princess.Two green Martian communities had been wiped off the face of Barsoom bythe avenging fleets, but no trace of Dejah Thoris had been found.  Theyhad been searching among the northern hordes, and only within the pastfew days had they extended their quest to the south.Kantos Kan had been detailed to one of the small one-man fliers and hadhad the misfortune to be discovered by the Warhoons while exploringtheir city.  The bravery and daring of the man won my greatest respectand admiration.  Alone he had landed at the city's boundary and on foothad penetrated to the buildings surrounding the plaza.  For two daysand nights he had explored their quarters and their dungeons in searchof his beloved princess only to fall into the hands of a party ofWarhoons as he was about to leave, after assuring himself that DejahThoris was not a captive there.During the period of our incarceration Kantos Kan and I became wellacquainted, and formed a warm personal friendship.  A few days onlyelapsed, however, before we were dragged forth from our dungeon for thegreat games.  We were conducted early one morning to an enormousamphitheater, which instead of having been built upon the surface ofthe ground was excavated below the surface.  It had partially filledwith debris so that how large it had originally been was difficult tosay.  In its present condition it held the entire twenty thousandWarhoons of the assembled hordes.The arena was immense but extremely uneven and unkempt.  Around it theWarhoons had piled building stone from some of the ruined edifices ofthe ancient city to prevent the animals and the captives from escapinginto the audience, and at each end had been constructed cages to holdthem until their turns came to meet some horrible death upon the arena.Kantos Kan and I were confined together in one of the cages.  In theothers were wild calots, thoats, mad zitidars, green warriors, andwomen of other hordes, and many strange and ferocious wild beasts ofBarsoom which I had never before seen.  The din of their roaring,growling and squealing was deafening and the formidable appearance ofany one of them was enough to make the stoutest heart feel graveforebodings.Kantos Kan explained to me that at the end of the day one of theseprisoners would gain freedom and the others would lie dead about thearena.  The winners in the various contests of the day would be pittedagainst each other until only two remained alive; the victor in thelast encounter being set free, whether animal or man.  The followingmorning the cages would be filled with a new consignment of victims,and so on throughout the ten days of the games.Shortly after we had been caged the amphitheater began to fill andwithin an hour every available part of the seating space was occupied.Dak Kova, with his jeds and chieftains, sat at the center of one sideof the arena upon a large raised platform.At a signal from Dak Kova the doors of two cages were thrown open and adozen green Martian females were driven to the center of the arena.Each was given a dagger and then, at the far end, a pack of twelvecalots, or wild dogs were loosed upon them.As the brutes, growling and foaming, rushed upon the almost defenselesswomen I turned my head that I might not see the horrid sight.  Theyells and laughter of the green horde bore witness to the excellentquality of the sport and when I turned back to the arena, as Kantos Kantold me it was over, I saw three victorious calots, snarling andgrowling over the bodies of their prey.  The women had given a goodaccount of themselves.Next a mad zitidar was loosed among the remaining dogs, and so it wentthroughout the long, hot, horrible day.During the day I was pitted against first men and then beasts, but as Iwas armed with a long-sword and always outclassed my adversary inagility and generally in strength as well, it proved but child's playto me.  Time and time again I won the applause of the bloodthirstymultitude, and toward the end there were cries that I be taken from thearena and be made a member of the hordes of Warhoon.Finally there were but three of us left, a great green warrior of somefar northern horde, Kantos Kan, and myself.The other two were to battle and then I to fight the conqueror for theliberty which was accorded the final winner.Kantos Kan had fought several times during the day and like myself hadalways proven victorious, but occasionally by the smallest of margins,especially when pitted against the green warriors.  I had little hopethat he could best his giant adversary who had mowed down all beforehim during the day.  The fellow towered nearly sixteen feet in height,while Kantos Kan was some inches under six feet.  As they advanced tomeet one another I saw for the first time a trick of Martianswordsmanship which centered Kantos Kan's every hope of victory andlife on one cast of the dice, for, as he came to within about twentyfeet of the huge fellow he threw his sword arm far behind him over hisshoulder and with a mighty sweep hurled his weapon point foremost atthe green warrior.  It flew true as an arrow and piercing the poordevil's heart laid him dead upon the arena.Kantos Kan and I were now pitted against each other but as weapproached to the encounter I whispered to him to prolong the battleuntil nearly dark in the hope that we might find some means of escape.The horde evidently guessed that we had no hearts to fight each otherand so they howled in rage as neither of us placed a fatal thrust.Just as I saw the sudden coming of dark I whispered to Kantos Kan tothrust his sword between my left arm and my body.  As he did so Istaggered back clasping the sword tightly with my arm and thus fell tothe ground with his weapon apparently protruding from my chest.  KantosKan perceived my coup and stepping quickly to my side he placed hisfoot upon my neck and withdrawing his sword from my body gave me thefinal death blow through the neck which is supposed to sever thejugular vein, but in this instance the cold blade slipped harmlesslyinto the sand of the arena.  In the darkness which had now fallen nonecould tell but that he had really finished me.  I whispered to him togo and claim his freedom and then look for me in the hills east of thecity, and so he left me.When the amphitheater had cleared I crept stealthily to the top and asthe great excavation lay far from the plaza and in an untenantedportion of the great dead city I had little trouble in reaching thehills beyond.CHAPTER XXIN THE ATMOSPHERE FACTORYFor two days I waited there for Kantos Kan, but as he did not come Istarted off on foot in a northwesterly direction toward a point wherehe had told me lay the nearest waterway.  My only food consisted ofvegetable milk from the plants which gave so bounteously of thispriceless fluid.Through two long weeks I wandered, stumbling through the nights guidedonly by the stars and hiding during the days behind some protrudingrock or among the occasional hills I traversed.  Several times I wasattacked by wild beasts; strange, uncouth monstrosities that leapedupon me in the dark, so that I had ever to grasp my long-sword in myhand that I might be ready for them.  Usually my strange, newlyacquired telepathic power warned me in ample time, but once I was downwith vicious fangs at my jugular and a hairy face pressed close to minebefore I knew that I was even threatened.What manner of thing was upon me I did not know, but that it was largeand heavy and many-legged I could feel.  My hands were at its throatbefore the fangs had a chance to bury themselves in my neck, and slowlyI forced the hairy face from me and closed my fingers, vise-like, uponits windpipe.Without sound we lay there, the beast exerting every effort to reach mewith those awful fangs, and I straining to maintain my grip and chokethe life from it as I kept it from my throat.  Slowly my arms gave tothe unequal struggle, and inch by inch the burning eyes and gleamingtusks of my antagonist crept toward me, until, as the hairy facetouched mine again, I realized that all was over.  And then a livingmass of destruction sprang from the surrounding darkness full upon thecreature that held me pinioned to the ground.  The two rolled growlingupon the moss, tearing and rending one another in a frightful manner,but it was soon over and my preserver stood with lowered head above thethroat of the dead thing which would have killed me.The nearer moon, hurtling suddenly above the horizon and lighting upthe Barsoomian scene, showed me that my preserver was Woola, but fromwhence he had come, or how found me, I was at a loss to know.  That Iwas glad of his companionship it is needless to say, but my pleasure atseeing him was tempered by anxiety as to the reason of his leavingDejah Thoris.  Only her death I felt sure, could account for hisabsence from her, so faithful I knew him to be to my commands.By the light of the now brilliant moons I saw that he was but a shadowof his former self, and as he turned from my caress and commencedgreedily to devour the dead carcass at my feet I realized that the poorfellow was more than half starved.  I, myself, was in but little betterplight but I could not bring myself to eat the uncooked flesh and I hadno means of making a fire.  When Woola had finished his meal I againtook up my weary and seemingly endless wandering in quest of theelusive waterway.At daybreak of the fifteenth day of my search I was overjoyed to seethe high trees that denoted the object of my search.  About noon Idragged myself wearily to the portals of a huge building which coveredperhaps four square miles and towered two hundred feet in the air.  Itshowed no aperture in the mighty walls other than the tiny door atwhich I sank exhausted, nor was there any sign of life about it.I could find no bell or other method of making my presence known to theinmates of the place, unless a small round hole in the wall near thedoor was for that purpose.  It was of about the bigness of a leadpencil and thinking that it might be in the nature of a speaking tube Iput my mouth to it and was about to call into it when a voice issuedfrom it asking me whom I might be, where from, and the nature of myerrand.I explained that I had escaped from the Warhoons and was dying ofstarvation and exhaustion.&quot;You wear the metal of a green warrior and are followed by a calot, yetyou are of the figure of a red man.  In color you are neither green norred.  In the name of the ninth day, what manner of creature are you?&quot;&quot;I am a friend of the red men of Barsoom and I am starving.  In thename of humanity open to us,&quot; I replied.Presently the door commenced to recede before me until it had sunk intothe wall fifty feet, then it stopped and slid easily to the left,exposing a short, narrow corridor of concrete, at the further end ofwhich was another door, similar in every respect to the one I had justpassed.  No one was in sight, yet immediately we passed the first doorit slid gently into place behind us and receded rapidly to its originalposition in the front wall of the building.  As the door had slippedaside I had noted its great thickness, fully twenty feet, and as itreached its place once more after closing behind us, great cylinders ofsteel had dropped from the ceiling behind it and fitted their lowerends into apertures countersunk in the floor.A second and third door receded before me and slipped to one side asthe first, before I reached a large inner chamber where I found foodand drink set out upon a great stone table.  A voice directed me tosatisfy my hunger and to feed my calot, and while I was thus engaged myinvisible host put me through a severe and searching cross-examination.&quot;Your statements are most remarkable,&quot; said the voice, on concludingits questioning, &quot;but you are evidently speaking the truth, and it isequally evident that you are not of Barsoom.  I can tell that by theconformation of your brain and the strange location of your internalorgans and the shape and size of your heart.&quot;&quot;Can you see through me?&quot; I exclaimed.&quot;Yes, I can see all but your thoughts, and were you a Barsoomian Icould read those.&quot;Then a door opened at the far side of the chamber and a strange, driedup, little mummy of a man came toward me.  He wore but a single articleof clothing or adornment, a small collar of gold from which dependedupon his chest a great ornament as large as a dinner plate set solidwith huge diamonds, except for the exact center which was occupied by astrange stone, an inch in diameter, that scintillated nine differentand distinct rays; the seven colors of our earthly prism and twobeautiful rays which, to me, were new and nameless.  I cannot describethem any more than you could describe red to a blind man.  I only knowthat they were beautiful in the extreme.The old man sat and talked with me for hours, and the strangest part ofour intercourse was that I could read his every thought while he couldnot fathom an iota from my mind unless I spoke.[Illustration: The old man sat and talked with me for hours.]I did not apprise him of my ability to sense his mental operations, andthus I learned a great deal which proved of immense value to me laterand which I would never have known had he suspected my strange power,for the Martians have such perfect control of their mental machinerythat they are able to direct their thoughts with absolute precision.The building in which I found myself contained the machinery whichproduces that artificial atmosphere which sustains life on Mars.  Thesecret of the entire process hinges on the use of the ninth ray, one ofthe beautiful scintillations which I had noted emanating from the greatstone in my host's diadem.This ray is separated from the other rays of the sun by means of finelyadjusted instruments placed upon the roof of the huge building,three-quarters of which is used for reservoirs in which the ninth rayis stored.  This product is then treated electrically, or rathercertain proportions of refined electric vibrations are incorporatedwith it, and the result is then pumped to the five principal aircenters of the planet where, as it is released, contact with the etherof space transforms it into atmosphere.There is always sufficient reserve of the ninth ray stored in the greatbuilding to maintain the present Martian atmosphere for a thousandyears, and the only fear, as my new friend told me, was that someaccident might befall the pumping apparatus.He led me to an inner chamber where I beheld a battery of twenty radiumpumps any one of which was equal to the task of furnishing all Marswith the atmosphere compound.  For eight hundred years, he told me, hehad watched these pumps which are used alternately a day each at astretch, or a little over twenty-four and one-half Earth hours.  He hasone assistant who divides the watch with him.  Half a Martian year,about three hundred and forty-four of our days, each of these men spendalone in this huge, isolated plant.Every red Martian is taught during earliest childhood the principles ofthe manufacture of atmosphere, but only two at one time ever hold thesecret of ingress to the great building, which, built as it is withwalls a hundred and fifty feet thick, is absolutely unassailable, eventhe roof being guarded from assault by air craft by a glass coveringfive feet thick.The only fear they entertain of attack is from the green Martians orsome demented red man, as all Barsoomians realize that the veryexistence of every form of life of Mars is dependent upon theuninterrupted working of this plant.One curious fact I discovered as I watched his thoughts was that theouter doors are manipulated by telepathic means.  The locks are sofinely adjusted that the doors are released by the action of a certaincombination of thought waves.  To experiment with my new-found toy Ithought to surprise him into revealing this combination and so I askedhim in a casual manner how he had managed to unlock the massive doorsfor me from the inner chambers of the building.  As quick as a flashthere leaped to his mind nine Martian sounds, but as quickly faded ashe answered that this was a secret he must not divulge.From then on his manner toward me changed as though he feared that hehad been surprised into divulging his great secret, and I readsuspicion and fear in his looks and thoughts, though his words werestill fair.Before I retired for the night he promised to give me a letter to anearby agricultural officer who would help me on my way to Zodanga,which he said, was the nearest Martian city.&quot;But be sure that you do not let them know you are bound for Helium asthey are at war with that country.  My assistant and I are of nocountry, we belong to all Barsoom and this talisman which we wearprotects us in all lands, even among the green men--though we do nottrust ourselves to their hands if we can avoid it,&quot; he added.&quot;And so good-night, my friend,&quot; he continued, &quot;may you have a long andrestful sleep--yes, a long sleep.&quot;And though he smiled pleasantly I saw in his thoughts the wish that hehad never admitted me, and then a picture of him standing over me inthe night, and the swift thrust of a long dagger and the half formedwords, &quot;I am sorry, but it is for the best good of Barsoom.&quot;As he closed the door of my chamber behind him his thoughts were cutoff from me as was the sight of him, which seemed strange to me in mylittle knowledge of thought transference.What was I to do?  How could I escape through these mighty walls?Easily could I kill him now that I was warned, but once he was dead Icould no more escape, and with the stopping of the machinery of thegreat plant I should die with all the other inhabitants of theplanet--all, even Dejah Thoris were she not already dead.  For theothers I did not give the snap of my finger, but the thought of DejahThoris drove from my mind all desire to kill my mistaken host.Cautiously I opened the door of my apartment and, followed by Woola,sought the inner of the great doors.  A wild scheme had come to me; Iwould attempt to force the great locks by the nine thought waves I hadread in my host's mind.Creeping stealthily through corridor after corridor and down windingrunways which turned hither and thither I finally reached the greathall in which I had broken my long fast that morning.  Nowhere had Iseen my host, nor did I know where he kept himself by night.I was on the point of stepping boldly out into the room when a slightnoise behind me warned me back into the shadows of a recess in thecorridor.  Dragging Woola after me I crouched low in the darkness.Presently the old man passed close by me, and as he entered the dimlylighted chamber which I had been about to pass through I saw that heheld a long thin dagger in his hand and that he was sharpening it upona stone.  In his mind was the decision to inspect the radium pumps,which would take about thirty minutes, and then return to my bedchamber and finish me.As he passed through the great hall and disappeared down the runwaywhich led to the pump-room, I stole stealthily from my hiding place andcrossed to the great door, the inner of the three which stood betweenme and liberty.Concentrating my mind upon the massive lock I hurled the nine thoughtwaves against it.  In breathless expectancy I waited, when finally thegreat door moved softly toward me and slid quietly to one side.  Oneafter the other the remaining mighty portals opened at my command andWoola and I stepped forth into the darkness, free, but little betteroff than we had been before, other than that we had full stomachs.Hastening away from the shadows of the formidable pile I made for thefirst crossroad, intending to strike the central turnpike as quickly aspossible.  This I reached about morning and entering the firstenclosure I came to I searched for some evidences of a habitation.There were low rambling buildings of concrete barred with heavyimpassable doors, and no amount of hammering and hallooing brought anyresponse.  Weary and exhausted from sleeplessness I threw myself uponthe ground commanding Woola to stand guard.Some time later I was awakened by his frightful growlings and opened myeyes to see three red Martians standing a short distance from us andcovering me with their rifles.&quot;I am unarmed and no enemy,&quot; I hastened to explain.  &quot;I have been aprisoner among the green men and am on my way to Zodanga.  All I ask isfood and rest for myself and my calot and the proper directions forreaching my destination.&quot;They lowered their rifles and advanced pleasantly toward me placingtheir right hands upon my left shoulder, after the manner of theircustom of salute, and asking me many questions about myself and mywanderings.  They then took me to the house of one of them which wasonly a short distance away.The buildings I had been hammering at in the early morning wereoccupied only by stock and farm produce, the house proper standingamong a grove of enormous trees, and, like all red-Martian homes, hadbeen raised at night some forty or fifty feet from the ground on alarge round metal shaft which slid up or down within a sleeve sunk inthe ground, and was operated by a tiny radium engine in the entrancehall of the building.  Instead of bothering with bolts and bars fortheir dwellings, the red Martians simply run them up out of harm's wayduring the night.  They also have private means for lowering or raisingthem from the ground without if they wish to go away and leave them.These brothers, with their wives and children, occupied three similarhouses on this farm.  They did no work themselves, being governmentofficers in charge.  The labor was performed by convicts, prisoners ofwar, delinquent debtors and confirmed bachelors who were too poor topay the high celibate tax which all red-Martian governments impose.They were the personification of cordiality and hospitality and I spentseveral days with them, resting and recuperating from my long andarduous experiences.When they had heard my story--I omitted all reference to Dejah Thorisand the old man of the atmosphere plant--they advised me to color mybody to more nearly resemble their own race and then attempt to findemployment in Zodanga, either in the army or the navy.&quot;The chances are small that your tale will be believed until after youhave proven your trustworthiness and won friends among the highernobles of the court.  This you can most easily do through militaryservice, as we are a warlike people on Barsoom,&quot; explained one of them,&quot;and save our richest favors for the fighting man.&quot;When I was ready to depart they furnished me with a small domestic bullthoat, such as is used for saddle purposes by all red Martians.  Theanimal is about the size of a horse and quite gentle, but in color andshape an exact replica of his huge and fierce cousin of the wilds.The brothers had supplied me with a reddish oil with which I anointedmy entire body and one of them cut my hair, which had grown quite long,in the prevailing fashion of the time, square at the back and banged infront, so that I could have passed anywhere upon Barsoom as afull-fledged red Martian.  My metal and ornaments were also renewed inthe style of a Zodangan gentleman, attached to the house of Ptor, whichwas the family name of my benefactors.They filled a little sack at my side with Zodangan money.  The mediumof exchange upon Mars is not dissimilar from our own except that thecoins are oval.  Paper money is issued by individuals as they requireit and redeemed twice yearly.  If a man issues more than he can redeem,the government pays his creditors in full and the debtor works out theamount upon the farms or in mines, which are all owned by thegovernment.  This suits everybody except the debtor as it has been adifficult thing to obtain sufficient voluntary labor to work the greatisolated farm lands of Mars, stretching as they do like narrow ribbonsfrom pole to pole, through wild stretches peopled by wild animals andwilder men.When I mentioned my inability to repay them for their kindness to methey assured me that I would have ample opportunity if I lived longupon Barsoom, and bidding me farewell they watched me until I was outof sight upon the broad white turnpike.CHAPTER XXIAN AIR SCOUT FOR ZODANGAAs I proceeded on my journey toward Zodanga many strange andinteresting sights arrested my attention, and at the several farmhouses where I stopped I learned a number of new and instructive thingsconcerning the methods and manners of Barsoom.The water which supplies the farms of Mars is collected in immenseunderground reservoirs at either pole from the melting ice caps, andpumped through long conduits to the various populated centers.  Alongeither side of these conduits, and extending their entire length, liethe cultivated districts.  These are divided into tracts of about thesame size, each tract being under the supervision of one or moregovernment officers.Instead of flooding the surface of the fields, and thus wasting immensequantities of water by evaporation, the precious liquid is carriedunderground through a vast network of small pipes directly to the rootsof the vegetation.  The crops upon Mars are always uniform, for thereare no droughts, no rains, no high winds, and no insects, or destroyingbirds.On this trip I tasted the first meat I had eaten since leavingEarth--large, juicy steaks and chops from the well-fed domestic animalsof the farms.  Also I enjoyed luscious fruits and vegetables, but not asingle article of food which was exactly similar to anything on Earth.Every plant and flower and vegetable and animal has been so refined byages of careful, scientific cultivation and breeding that the like ofthem on Earth dwindled into pale, gray, characterless nothingness bycomparison.At a second stop I met some highly cultivated people of the noble classand while in conversation we chanced to speak of Helium.  One of theolder men had been there on a diplomatic mission several years beforeand spoke with regret of the conditions which seemed destined ever tokeep these two countries at war.&quot;Helium,&quot; he said, &quot;rightly boasts the most beautiful women of Barsoom,and of all her treasures the wondrous daughter of Mors Kajak, DejahThoris, is the most exquisite flower.&quot;Why,&quot; he added, &quot;the people really worship the ground she walks uponand since her loss on that ill-starred expedition all Helium has beendraped in mourning.&quot;That our ruler should have attacked the disabled fleet as it wasreturning to Helium was but another of his awful blunders which I fearwill sooner or later compel Zodanga to elevate a wiser man to hisplace.&quot;&quot;Even now, though our victorious armies are surrounding Helium, thepeople of Zodanga are voicing their displeasure, for the war is not apopular one, since it is not based on right or justice.  Our forcestook advantage of the absence of the principal fleet of Helium on theirsearch for the princess, and so we have been able easily to reduce thecity to a sorry plight.  It is said she will fall within the next fewpassages of the further moon.&quot;&quot;And what, think you, may have been the fate of the princess, DejahThoris?&quot; I asked as casually as possible.&quot;She is dead,&quot; he answered.  &quot;This much was learned from a greenwarrior recently captured by our forces in the south.  She escaped fromthe hordes of Thark with a strange creature of another world, only tofall into the hands of the Warhoons.  Their thoats were found wanderingupon the sea bottom and evidences of a bloody conflict were discoverednearby.&quot;While this information was in no way reassuring, neither was it at allconclusive proof of the death of Dejah Thoris, and so I determined tomake every effort possible to reach Helium as quickly as I could andcarry to Tardos Mors such news of his granddaughter's possiblewhereabouts as lay in my power.Ten days after leaving the three Ptor brothers I arrived at Zodanga.From the moment that I had come in contact with the red inhabitants ofMars I had noticed that Woola drew a great amount of unwelcomeattention to me, since the huge brute belonged to a species which isnever domesticated by the red men.  Were one to stroll down Broadwaywith a Numidian lion at his heels the effect would be somewhat similarto that which I should have produced had I entered Zodanga with Woola.The very thought of parting with the faithful fellow caused me so greatregret and genuine sorrow that I put it off until just before wearrived at the city's gates; but then, finally, it became imperativethat we separate.  Had nothing further than my own safety or pleasurebeen at stake no argument could have prevailed upon me to turn away theone creature upon Barsoom that had never failed in a demonstration ofaffection and loyalty; but as I would willingly have offered my life inthe service of her in search of whom I was about to challenge theunknown dangers of this, to me, mysterious city, I could not permiteven Woola's life to threaten the success of my venture, much less hismomentary happiness, for I doubted not he soon would forget me.  And soI bade the poor beast an affectionate farewell, promising him, however,that if I came through my adventure in safety that in some way I shouldfind the means to search him out.He seemed to understand me fully, and when I pointed back in thedirection of Thark he turned sorrowfully away, nor could I bear towatch him go; but resolutely set my face toward Zodanga and with atouch of heartsickness approached her frowning walls.The letter I bore from them gained me immediate entrance to the vast,walled city.  It was still very early in the morning and the streetswere practically deserted.  The residences, raised high upon theirmetal columns, resembled huge rookeries, while the uprights themselvespresented the appearance of steel tree trunks.  The shops as a rulewere not raised from the ground nor were their doors bolted or barred,since thievery is practically unknown upon Barsoom.  Assassination isthe ever-present fear of all Barsoomians, and for this reason alonetheir homes are raised high above the ground at night, or in times ofdanger.The Ptor brothers had given me explicit directions for reaching thepoint of the city where I could find living accommodations and be nearthe offices of the government agents to whom they had given me letters.My way led to the central square or plaza, which is a characteristic ofall Martian cities.The plaza of Zodanga covers a square mile and is bounded by the palacesof the jeddak, the jeds, and other members of the royalty and nobilityof Zodanga, as well as by the principal public buildings, cafes, andshops.As I was crossing the great square lost in wonder and admiration of themagnificent architecture and the gorgeous scarlet vegetation whichcarpeted the broad lawns I discovered a red Martian walking brisklytoward me from one of the avenues.  He paid not the slightest attentionto me, but as he came abreast I recognized him, and turning I placed myhand upon his shoulder, calling out:&quot;Kaor, Kantos Kan!&quot;Like lightning he wheeled and before I could so much as lower my handthe point of his long-sword was at my breast.&quot;Who are you?&quot; he growled, and then as a backward leap carried me fiftyfeet from his sword he dropped the point to the ground and exclaimed,laughing,&quot;I do not need a better reply, there is but one man upon all Barsoomwho can bounce about like a rubber ball.  By the mother of the furthermoon, John Carter, how came you here, and have you become a Darseenthat you can change your color at will?&quot;&quot;You gave me a bad half minute my friend,&quot; he continued, after I hadbriefly outlined my adventures since parting with him in the arena atWarhoon.  &quot;Were my name and city known to the Zodangans I would shortlybe sitting on the banks of the lost sea of Korus with my revered anddeparted ancestors.  I am here in the interest of Tardos Mors, Jeddakof Helium, to discover the whereabouts of Dejah Thoris, our princess.Sab Than, prince of Zodanga, has her hidden in the city and has fallenmadly in love with her.  His father, Than Kosis, Jeddak of Zodanga, hasmade her voluntary marriage to his son the price of peace between ourcountries, but Tardos Mors will not accede to the demands and has sentword that he and his people would rather look upon the dead face oftheir princess than see her wed to any than her own choice, and thatpersonally he would prefer being engulfed in the ashes of a lost andburning Helium to joining the metal of his house with that of ThanKosis.  His reply was the deadliest affront he could have put upon ThanKosis and the Zodangans, but his people love him the more for it andhis strength in Helium is greater today than ever.&quot;I have been here three days,&quot; continued Kantos Kan, &quot;but I have notyet found where Dejah Thoris is imprisoned.  Today I join the Zodangannavy as an air scout and I hope in this way to win the confidence ofSab Than, the prince, who is commander of this division of the navy,and thus learn the whereabouts of Dejah Thoris.  I am glad that you arehere, John Carter, for I know your loyalty to my princess and two of usworking together should be able to accomplish much.&quot;The plaza was now commencing to fill with people going and coming uponthe daily activities of their duties.  The shops were opening and thecafes filling with early morning patrons.  Kantos Kan led me to one ofthese gorgeous eating places where we were served entirely bymechanical apparatus.  No hand touched the food from the time itentered the building in its raw state until it emerged hot anddelicious upon the tables before the guests, in response to thetouching of tiny buttons to indicate their desires.After our meal, Kantos Kan took me with him to the headquarters of theair-scout squadron and introducing me to his superior asked that I beenrolled as a member of the corps.  In accordance with custom anexamination was necessary, but Kantos Kan had told me to have no fearon this score as he would attend to that part of the matter.  Heaccomplished this by taking my order for examination to the examiningofficer and representing himself as John Carter.&quot;This ruse will be discovered later,&quot; he cheerfully explained, &quot;whenthey check up my weights, measurements, and other personalidentification data, but it will be several months before this is doneand our mission should be accomplished or have failed long before thattime.&quot;The next few days were spent by Kantos Kan in teaching me theintricacies of flying and of repairing the dainty little contrivanceswhich the Martians use for this purpose.  The body of the one-man aircraft is about sixteen feet long, two feet wide and three inches thick,tapering to a point at each end.  The driver sits on top of this planeupon a seat constructed over the small, noiseless radium engine whichpropels it.  The medium of buoyancy is contained within the thin metalwalls of the body and consists of the eighth Barsoomian ray, or ray ofpropulsion, as it may be termed in view of its properties.This ray, like the ninth ray, is unknown on Earth, but the Martianshave discovered that it is an inherent property of all light no matterfrom what source it emanates.  They have learned that it is the solareighth ray which propels the light of the sun to the various planets,and that it is the individual eighth ray of each planet which&quot;reflects,&quot; or propels the light thus obtained out into space oncemore.  The solar eighth ray would be absorbed by the surface ofBarsoom, but the Barsoomian eighth ray, which tends to propel lightfrom Mars into space, is constantly streaming out from the planetconstituting a force of repulsion of gravity which when confined isable to lift enormous weights from the surface of the ground.It is this ray which has enabled them to so perfect aviation thatbattle ships far outweighing anything known upon Earth sail asgracefully and lightly through the thin air of Barsoom as a toy balloonin the heavy atmosphere of Earth.During the early years of the discovery of this ray many strangeaccidents occurred before the Martians learned to measure and controlthe wonderful power they had found.  In one instance, some nine hundredyears before, the first great battle ship to be built with eighth rayreservoirs was stored with too great a quantity of the rays and she hadsailed up from Helium with five hundred officers and men, never toreturn.Her power of repulsion for the planet was so great that it had carriedher far into space, where she can be seen today, by the aid of powerfultelescopes, hurtling through the heavens ten thousand miles from Mars;a tiny satellite that will thus encircle Barsoom to the end of time.The fourth day after my arrival at Zodanga I made my first flight, andas a result of it I won a promotion which included quarters in thepalace of Than Kosis.As I rose above the city I circled several times, as I had seen KantosKan do, and then throwing my engine into top speed I raced at terrificvelocity toward the south, following one of the great waterways whichenter Zodanga from that direction.I had traversed perhaps two hundred miles in a little less than an hourwhen I descried far below me a party of three green warriors racingmadly toward a small figure on foot which seemed to be trying to reachthe confines of one of the walled fields.Dropping my machine rapidly toward them, and circling to the rear ofthe warriors, I soon saw that the object of their pursuit was a redMartian wearing the metal of the scout squadron to which I wasattached.  A short distance away lay his tiny flier, surrounded by thetools with which he had evidently been occupied in repairing somedamage when surprised by the green warriors.They were now almost upon him; their flying mounts charging down on therelatively puny figure at terrific speed, while the warriors leaned lowto the right, with their great metal-shod spears.  Each seemed strivingto be the first to impale the poor Zodangan and in another moment hisfate would have been sealed had it not been for my timely arrival.Driving my fleet air craft at high speed directly behind the warriors Isoon overtook them and without diminishing my speed I rammed the prowof my little flier between the shoulders of the nearest.  The impactsufficient to have torn through inches of solid steel, hurled thefellow's headless body into the air over the head of his thoat, whereit fell sprawling upon the moss.  The mounts of the other two warriorsturned squealing in terror, and bolted in opposite directions.Reducing my speed I circled and came to the ground at the feet of theastonished Zodangan.  He was warm in his thanks for my timely aid andpromised that my day's work would bring the reward it merited, for itwas none other than a cousin of the jeddak of Zodanga whose life I hadsaved.We wasted no time in talk as we knew that the warriors would surelyreturn as soon as they had gained control of their mounts.  Hasteningto his damaged machine we were bending every effort to finish theneeded repairs and had almost completed them when we saw the two greenmonsters returning at top speed from opposite sides of us.  When theyhad approached within a hundred yards their thoats again becameunmanageable and absolutely refused to advance further toward the aircraft which had frightened them.The warriors finally dismounted and hobbling their animals advancedtoward us on foot with drawn long-swords.I advanced to meet the larger, telling the Zodangan to do the best hecould with the other.  Finishing my man with almost no effort, as hadnow from much practice become habitual with me, I hastened to return tomy new acquaintance whom I found indeed in desperate straits.He was wounded and down with the huge foot of his antagonist upon histhroat and the great long-sword raised to deal the final thrust.  Witha bound I cleared the fifty feet intervening between us, and withoutstretched point drove my sword completely through the body of thegreen warrior.  His sword fell, harmless, to the ground and he sanklimply upon the prostrate form of the Zodangan.A cursory examination of the latter revealed no mortal injuries andafter a brief rest he asserted that he felt fit to attempt the returnvoyage.  He would have to pilot his own craft, however, as these frailvessels are not intended to convey but a single person.Quickly completing the repairs we rose together into the still,cloudless Martian sky, and at great speed and without further mishapreturned to Zodanga.As we neared the city we discovered a mighty concourse of civilians andtroops assembled upon the plain before the city.  The sky was blackwith naval vessels and private and public pleasure craft, flying longstreamers of gay-colored silks, and banners and flags of odd andpicturesque design.My companion signaled that I slow down, and running his machine closebeside mine suggested that we approach and watch the ceremony, which,he said, was for the purpose of conferring honors on individualofficers and men for bravery and other distinguished service.  He thenunfurled a little ensign which denoted that his craft bore a member ofthe royal family of Zodanga, and together we made our way through themaze of low-lying air vessels until we hung directly over the jeddak ofZodanga and his staff.  All were mounted upon the small domestic bullthoats of the red Martians, and their trappings and ornamentation boresuch a quantity of gorgeously colored feathers that I could not but bestruck with the startling resemblance the concourse bore to a band ofthe red Indians of my own Earth.One of the staff called the attention of Than Kosis to the presence ofmy companion above them and the ruler motioned for him to descend.  Asthey waited for the troops to move into position facing the jeddak thetwo talked earnestly together, the jeddak and his staff occasionallyglancing up at me.  I could not hear their conversation and presentlyit ceased and all dismounted, as the last body of troops had wheeledinto position before their emperor.  A member of the staff advancedtoward the troops, and calling the name of a soldier commanded him toadvance.  The officer then recited the nature of the heroic act whichhad won the approval of the jeddak, and the latter advanced and placeda metal ornament upon the left arm of the lucky man.Ten men had been so decorated when the aide called out,&quot;John Carter, air scout!&quot;Never in my life had I been so surprised, but the habit of militarydiscipline is strong within me, and I dropped my little machine lightlyto the ground and advanced on foot as I had seen the others do.  As Ihalted before the officer, he addressed me in a voice audible to theentire assemblage of troops and spectators.&quot;In recognition, John Carter,&quot; he said, &quot;of your remarkable courage andskill in defending the person of the cousin of the jeddak Than Kosisand, singlehanded, vanquishing three green warriors, it is the pleasureof our jeddak to confer on you the mark of his esteem.&quot;Than Kosis then advanced toward me and placing an ornament upon me,said:&quot;My cousin has narrated the details of your wonderful achievement,which seems little short of miraculous, and if you can so well defend acousin of the jeddak how much better could you defend the person of thejeddak himself.  You are therefore appointed a padwar of The Guards andwill be quartered in my palace hereafter.&quot;I thanked him, and at his direction joined the members of his staff.After the ceremony I returned my machine to its quarters on the roof ofthe barracks of the air-scout squadron, and with an orderly from thepalace to guide me I reported to the officer in charge of the palace.CHAPTER XXIII FIND DEJAHThe major-domo to whom I reported had been given instructions tostation me near the person of the jeddak, who, in time of war, isalways in great danger of assassination, as the rule that all is fairin war seems to constitute the entire ethics of Martian conflict.He therefore escorted me immediately to the apartment in which ThanKosis then was.  The ruler was engaged in conversation with his son,Sab Than, and several courtiers of his household, and did not perceivemy entrance.The walls of the apartment were completely hung with splendidtapestries which hid any windows or doors which may have pierced them.The room was lighted by imprisoned rays of sunshine held between theceiling proper and what appeared to be a ground-glass false ceiling afew inches below.My guide drew aside one of the tapestries, disclosing a passage whichencircled the room, between the hangings and the walls of the chamber.Within this passage I was to remain, he said, so long as Than Kosis wasin the apartment.  When he left I was to follow.  My only duty was toguard the ruler and keep out of sight as much as possible.  I would berelieved after a period of four hours.  The major-domo then left me.The tapestries were of a strange weaving which gave the appearance ofheavy solidity from one side, but from my hiding place I could perceiveall that took place within the room as readily as though there had beenno curtain intervening.Scarcely had I gained my post than the tapestry at the opposite end ofthe chamber separated and four soldiers of The Guard entered,surrounding a female figure.  As they approached Than Kosis thesoldiers fell to either side and there standing before the jeddak andnot ten feet from me, her beautiful face radiant with smiles, was DejahThoris.Sab Than, Prince of Zodanga, advanced to meet her, and hand in handthey approached close to the jeddak.  Than Kosis looked up in surprise,and, rising, saluted her.&quot;To what strange freak do I owe this visit from the Princess of Helium,who, two days ago, with rare consideration for my pride, assured methat she would prefer Tal Hajus, the green Thark, to my son?&quot;Dejah Thoris only smiled the more and with the roguish dimples playingat the corners of her mouth she made answer:&quot;From the beginning of time upon Barsoom it has been the prerogative ofwoman to change her mind as she listed and to dissemble in mattersconcerning her heart.  That you will forgive, Than Kosis, as has yourson.  Two days ago I was not sure of his love for me, but now I am, andI have come to beg of you to forget my rash words and to accept theassurance of the Princess of Helium that when the time comes she willwed Sab Than, Prince of Zodanga.&quot;&quot;I am glad that you have so decided,&quot; replied Than Kosis.  &quot;It is farfrom my desire to push war further against the people of Helium, and,your promise shall be recorded and a proclamation to my people issuedforthwith.&quot;&quot;It were better, Than Kosis,&quot; interrupted Dejah Thoris, &quot;that theproclamation wait the ending of this war.  It would look strange indeedto my people and to yours were the Princess of Helium to give herselfto her country's enemy in the midst of hostilities.&quot;&quot;Cannot the war be ended at once?&quot; spoke Sab Than.  &quot;It requires butthe word of Than Kosis to bring peace.  Say it, my father, say the wordthat will hasten my happiness, and end this unpopular strife.&quot;&quot;We shall see,&quot; replied Than Kosis, &quot;how the people of Helium take topeace.  I shall at least offer it to them.&quot;Dejah Thoris, after a few words, turned and left the apartment, stillfollowed by her guards.Thus was the edifice of my brief dream of happiness dashed, broken, tothe ground of reality.  The woman for whom I had offered my life, andfrom whose lips I had so recently heard a declaration of love for me,had lightly forgotten my very existence and smilingly given herself tothe son of her people's most hated enemy.Although I had heard it with my own ears I could not believe it.  Imust search out her apartments and force her to repeat the cruel truthto me alone before I would be convinced, and so I deserted my post andhastened through the passage behind the tapestries toward the door bywhich she had left the chamber.  Slipping quietly through this openingI discovered a maze of winding corridors, branching and turning inevery direction.Running rapidly down first one and then another of them I soon becamehopelessly lost and was standing panting against a side wall when Iheard voices near me.  Apparently they were coming from the oppositeside of the partition against which I leaned and presently I made outthe tones of Dejah Thoris.  I could not hear the words but I knew thatI could not possibly be mistaken in the voice.Moving on a few steps I discovered another passageway at the end ofwhich lay a door.  Walking boldly forward I pushed into the room onlyto find myself in a small antechamber in which were the four guards whohad accompanied her.  One of them instantly arose and accosted me,asking the nature of my business.&quot;I am from Than Kosis,&quot; I replied, &quot;and wish to speak privately withDejah Thoris, Princess of Helium.&quot;&quot;And your order?&quot; asked the fellow.I did not know what he meant, but replied that I was a member of TheGuard, and without waiting for a reply from him I strode toward theopposite door of the antechamber, behind which I could hear DejahThoris conversing.But my entrance was not to be so easily accomplished.  The guardsmanstepped before me, saying,&quot;No one comes from Than Kosis without carrying an order or thepassword.  You must give me one or the other before you may pass.&quot;&quot;The only order I require, my friend, to enter where I will, hangs atmy side,&quot; I answered, tapping my long-sword; &quot;will you let me pass inpeace or no?&quot;For reply he whipped out his own sword, calling to the others to joinhim, and thus the four stood, with drawn weapons, barring my furtherprogress.&quot;You are not here by the order of Than Kosis,&quot; cried the one who hadfirst addressed me, &quot;and not only shall you not enter the apartments ofthe Princess of Helium but you shall go back to Than Kosis under guardto explain this unwarranted temerity.  Throw down your sword; youcannot hope to overcome four of us,&quot; he added with a grim smile.My reply was a quick thrust which left me but three antagonists and Ican assure you that they were worthy of my metal.  They had me backedagainst the wall in no time, fighting for my life.  Slowly I worked myway to a corner of the room where I could force them to come at me onlyone at a time, and thus we fought upward of twenty minutes; theclanging of steel on steel producing a veritable bedlam in the littleroom.The noise had brought Dejah Thoris to the door of her apartment, andthere she stood throughout the conflict with Sola at her back peeringover her shoulder.  Her face was set and emotionless and I knew thatshe did not recognize me, nor did Sola.Finally a lucky cut brought down a second guardsman and then, with onlytwo opposing me, I changed my tactics and rushed them down after thefashion of my fighting that had won me many a victory.  The third fellwithin ten seconds after the second, and the last lay dead upon thebloody floor a few moments later.  They were brave men and noblefighters, and it grieved me that I had been forced to kill them, but Iwould have willingly depopulated all Barsoom could I have reached theside of my Dejah Thoris in no other way.Sheathing my bloody blade I advanced toward my Martian Princess, whostill stood mutely gazing at me without sign of recognition.&quot;Who are you, Zodangan?&quot; she whispered.  &quot;Another enemy to harass me inmy misery?&quot;&quot;I am a friend,&quot; I answered, &quot;a once cherished friend.&quot;&quot;No friend of Helium's princess wears that metal,&quot; she replied, &quot;andyet the voice!  I have heard it before; it is not--it cannot be--no,for he is dead.&quot;&quot;It is, though, my Princess, none other than John Carter,&quot; I said.  &quot;Doyou not recognize, even through paint and strange metal, the heart ofyour chieftain?&quot;As I came close to her she swayed toward me with outstretched hands,but as I reached to take her in my arms she drew back with a shudderand a little moan of misery.&quot;Too late, too late,&quot; she grieved.  &quot;O my chieftain that was, and whomI thought dead, had you but returned one little hour before--but now itis too late, too late.&quot;&quot;What do you mean, Dejah Thoris?&quot; I cried.  &quot;That you would not havepromised yourself to the Zodangan prince had you known that I lived?&quot;&quot;Think you, John Carter, that I would give my heart to you yesterdayand today to another?  I thought that it lay buried with your ashes inthe pits of Warhoon, and so today I have promised my body to another tosave my people from the curse of a victorious Zodangan army.&quot;&quot;But I am not dead, my princess.  I have come to claim you, and allZodanga cannot prevent it.&quot;&quot;It is too late, John Carter, my promise is given, and on Barsoom thatis final.  The ceremonies which follow later are but meaninglessformalities.  They make the fact of marriage no more certain than doesthe funeral cortege of a jeddak again place the seal of death upon him.I am as good as married, John Carter.  No longer may you call me yourprincess.  No longer are you my chieftain.&quot;&quot;I know but little of your customs here upon Barsoom, Dejah Thoris, butI do know that I love you, and if you meant the last words you spoke tome that day as the hordes of Warhoon were charging down upon us, noother man shall ever claim you as his bride.  You meant them then, myprincess, and you mean them still!  Say that it is true.&quot;&quot;I meant them, John Carter,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;I cannot repeat them nowfor I have given myself to another.  Ah, if you had only known ourways, my friend,&quot; she continued, half to herself, &quot;the promise wouldhave been yours long months ago, and you could have claimed me beforeall others.  It might have meant the fall of Helium, but I would havegiven my empire for my Tharkian chief.&quot;Then aloud she said: &quot;Do you remember the night when you offended me?You called me your princess without having asked my hand of me, andthen you boasted that you had fought for me.  You did not know, and Ishould not have been offended; I see that now.  But there was no one totell you what I could not, that upon Barsoom there are two kinds ofwomen in the cities of the red men.  The one they fight for that theymay ask them in marriage; the other kind they fight for also, but neverask their hands.  When a man has won a woman he may address her as hisprincess, or in any of the several terms which signify possession.  Youhad fought for me, but had never asked me in marriage, and so when youcalled me your princess, you see,&quot; she faltered, &quot;I was hurt, but eventhen, John Carter, I did not repulse you, as I should have done, untilyou made it doubly worse by taunting me with having won me throughcombat.&quot;&quot;I do not need ask your forgiveness now, Dejah Thoris,&quot; I cried.  &quot;Youmust know that my fault was of ignorance of your Barsoomian customs.What I failed to do, through implicit belief that my petition would bepresumptuous and unwelcome, I do now, Dejah Thoris; I ask you to be mywife, and by all the Virginian fighting blood that flows in my veinsyou shall be.&quot;&quot;No, John Carter, it is useless,&quot; she cried, hopelessly, &quot;I may neverbe yours while Sab Than lives.&quot;&quot;You have sealed his death warrant, my princess--Sab Than dies.&quot;&quot;Nor that either,&quot; she hastened to explain.  &quot;I may not wed the man whoslays my husband, even in self-defense.  It is custom.  We are ruled bycustom upon Barsoom.  It is useless, my friend.  You must bear thesorrow with me.  That at least we may share in common.  That, and thememory of the brief days among the Tharks.  You must go now, nor eversee me again.  Good-bye, my chieftain that was.&quot;Disheartened and dejected, I withdrew from the room, but I was notentirely discouraged, nor would I admit that Dejah Thoris was lost tome until the ceremony had actually been performed.As I wandered along the corridors, I was as absolutely lost in themazes of winding passageways as I had been before I discovered DejahThoris' apartments.I knew that my only hope lay in escape from the city of Zodanga, forthe matter of the four dead guardsmen would have to be explained, andas I could never reach my original post without a guide, suspicionwould surely rest on me so soon as I was discovered wandering aimlesslythrough the palace.Presently I came upon a spiral runway leading to a lower floor, andthis I followed downward for several stories until I reached thedoorway of a large apartment in which were a number of guardsmen.  Thewalls of this room were hung with transparent tapestries behind which Isecreted myself without being apprehended.The conversation of the guardsmen was general, and awakened no interestin me until an officer entered the room and ordered four of the men torelieve the detail who were guarding the Princess of Helium.  Now, Iknew, my troubles would commence in earnest and indeed they were uponme all too soon, for it seemed that the squad had scarcely left theguardroom before one of their number burst in again breathlessly,crying that they had found their four comrades butchered in theantechamber.In a moment the entire palace was alive with people.  Guardsmen,officers, courtiers, servants, and slaves ran helter-skelter throughthe corridors and apartments carrying messages and orders, andsearching for signs of the assassin.This was my opportunity and slim as it appeared I grasped it, for as anumber of soldiers came hurrying past my hiding place I fell in behindthem and followed through the mazes of the palace until, in passingthrough a great hall, I saw the blessed light of day coming in througha series of larger windows.Here I left my guides, and, slipping to the nearest window, sought foran avenue of escape.  The windows opened upon a great balcony whichoverlooked one of the broad avenues of Zodanga.  The ground was aboutthirty feet below, and at a like distance from the building was a wallfully twenty feet high, constructed of polished glass about a foot inthickness.  To a red Martian escape by this path would have appearedimpossible, but to me, with my earthly strength and agility, it seemedalready accomplished.  My only fear was in being detected beforedarkness fell, for I could not make the leap in broad daylight whilethe court below and the avenue beyond were crowded with Zodangans.Accordingly I searched for a hiding place and finally found one byaccident, inside a huge hanging ornament which swung from the ceilingof the hall, and about ten feet from the floor.  Into the capaciousbowl-like vase I sprang with ease, and scarcely had I settled downwithin it than I heard a number of people enter the apartment.  Thegroup stopped beneath my hiding place and I could plainly overheartheir every word.&quot;It is the work of Heliumites,&quot; said one of the men.&quot;Yes, O Jeddak, but how had they access to the palace?  I could believethat even with the diligent care of your guardsmen a single enemy mightreach the inner chambers, but how a force of six or eight fighting mencould have done so unobserved is beyond me.  We shall soon know,however, for here comes the royal psychologist.&quot;Another man now joined the group, and, after making his formalgreetings to his ruler, said:&quot;O mighty Jeddak, it is a strange tale I read in the dead minds of yourfaithful guardsmen.  They were felled not by a number of fighting men,but by a single opponent.&quot;He paused to let the full weight of this announcement impress hishearers, and that his statement was scarcely credited was evidenced bythe impatient exclamation of incredulity which escaped the lips of ThanKosis.&quot;What manner of weird tale are you bringing me, Notan?&quot; he cried.&quot;It is the truth, my Jeddak,&quot; replied the psychologist.  &quot;In fact theimpressions were strongly marked on the brain of each of the fourguardsmen.  Their antagonist was a very tall man, wearing the metal ofone of your own guardsmen, and his fighting ability was little short ofmarvelous for he fought fair against the entire four and vanquishedthem by his surpassing skill and superhuman strength and endurance.Though he wore the metal of Zodanga, my Jeddak, such a man was neverseen before in this or any other country upon Barsoom.&quot;The mind of the Princess of Helium whom I have examined and questionedwas a blank to me, she has perfect control, and I could not read oneiota of it.  She said that she witnessed a portion of the encounter,and that when she looked there was but one man engaged with theguardsmen; a man whom she did not recognize as ever having seen.&quot;&quot;Where is my erstwhile savior?&quot; spoke another of the party, and Irecognized the voice of the cousin of Than Kosis, whom I had rescuedfrom the green warriors.  &quot;By the metal of my first ancestor,&quot; he wenton, &quot;but the description fits him to perfection, especially as to hisfighting ability.&quot;&quot;Where is this man?&quot; cried Than Kosis.  &quot;Have him brought to me atonce.  What know you of him, cousin?  It seemed strange to me now thatI think upon it that there should have been such a fighting man inZodanga, of whose name, even, we were ignorant before today.  And hisname too, John Carter, who ever heard of such a name upon Barsoom!&quot;Word was soon brought that I was nowhere to be found, either in thepalace or at my former quarters in the barracks of the air-scoutsquadron.  Kantos Kan, they had found and questioned, but he knewnothing of my whereabouts, and as to my past, he had told them he knewas little, since he had but recently met me during our captivity amongthe Warhoons.&quot;Keep your eyes on this other one,&quot; commanded Than Kosis.  &quot;He also isa stranger and likely as not they both hail from Helium, and where oneis we shall sooner or later find the other.  Quadruple the air patrol,and let every man who leaves the city by air or ground be subjected tothe closest scrutiny.&quot;Another messenger now entered with word that I was still within thepalace walls.&quot;The likeness of every person who has entered or left the palacegrounds today has been carefully examined,&quot; concluded the fellow, &quot;andnot one approaches the likeness of this new padwar of the guards, otherthan that which was recorded of him at the time he entered.&quot;&quot;Then we will have him shortly,&quot; commented Than Kosis contentedly, &quot;andin the meanwhile we will repair to the apartments of the Princess ofHelium and question her in regard to the affair.  She may know morethan she cared to divulge to you, Notan.  Come.&quot;They left the hall, and, as darkness had fallen without, I slippedlightly from my hiding place and hastened to the balcony.  Few were insight, and choosing a moment when none seemed near I sprang quickly tothe top of the glass wall and from there to the avenue beyond thepalace grounds.CHAPTER XXIIILOST IN THE SKYWithout effort at concealment I hastened to the vicinity of ourquarters, where I felt sure I should find Kantos Kan.  As I neared thebuilding I became more careful, as I judged, and rightly, that theplace would be guarded.  Several men in civilian metal loitered nearthe front entrance and in the rear were others.  My only means ofreaching, unseen, the upper story where our apartments were situatedwas through an adjoining building, and after considerable maneuvering Imanaged to attain the roof of a shop several doors away.Leaping from roof to roof, I soon reached an open window in thebuilding where I hoped to find the Heliumite, and in another moment Istood in the room before him.  He was alone and showed no surprise atmy coming, saying he had expected me much earlier, as my tour of dutymust have ended some time since.I saw that he knew nothing of the events of the day at the palace, andwhen I had enlightened him he was all excitement.  The news that DejahThoris had promised her hand to Sab Than filled him with dismay.&quot;It cannot be,&quot; he exclaimed.  &quot;It is impossible!  Why no man in allHelium but would prefer death to the selling of our loved princess tothe ruling house of Zodanga.  She must have lost her mind to haveassented to such an atrocious bargain.  You, who do not know how we ofHelium love the members of our ruling house, cannot appreciate thehorror with which I contemplate such an unholy alliance.&quot;&quot;What can be done, John Carter?&quot; he continued.  &quot;You are a resourcefulman.  Can you not think of some way to save Helium from this disgrace?&quot;&quot;If I can come within sword's reach of Sab Than,&quot; I answered, &quot;I cansolve the difficulty in so far as Helium is concerned, but for personalreasons I would prefer that another struck the blow that frees DejahThoris.&quot;Kantos Kan eyed me narrowly before he spoke.&quot;You love her!&quot; he said.  &quot;Does she know it?&quot;&quot;She knows it, Kantos Kan, and repulses me only because she is promisedto Sab Than.&quot;The splendid fellow sprang to his feet, and grasping me by the shoulderraised his sword on high, exclaiming:&quot;And had the choice been left to me I could not have chosen a morefitting mate for the first princess of Barsoom.  Here is my hand uponyour shoulder, John Carter, and my word that Sab Than shall go out atthe point of my sword for the sake of my love for Helium, for DejahThoris, and for you.  This very night I shall try to reach his quartersin the palace.&quot;&quot;How?&quot; I asked.  &quot;You are strongly guarded and a quadruple forcepatrols the sky.&quot;He bent his head in thought a moment, then raised it with an air ofconfidence.&quot;I only need to pass these guards and I can do it,&quot; he said at last.&quot;I know a secret entrance to the palace through the pinnacle of thehighest tower.  I fell upon it by chance one day as I was passing abovethe palace on patrol duty.  In this work it is required that weinvestigate any unusual occurrence we may witness, and a face peeringfrom the pinnacle of the high tower of the palace was, to me, mostunusual.  I therefore drew near and discovered that the possessor ofthe peering face was none other than Sab Than.  He was slightly put outat being detected and commanded me to keep the matter to myself,explaining that the passage from the tower led directly to hisapartments, and was known only to him.  If I can reach the roof of thebarracks and get my machine I can be in Sab Than's quarters in fiveminutes; but how am I to escape from this building, guarded as you sayit is?&quot;&quot;How well are the machine sheds at the barracks guarded?&quot; I asked.&quot;There is usually but one man on duty there at night upon the roof.&quot;&quot;Go to the roof of this building, Kantos Kan, and wait me there.&quot;Without stopping to explain my plans I retraced my way to the streetand hastened to the barracks.  I did not dare to enter the building,filled as it was with members of the air-scout squadron, who, in commonwith all Zodanga, were on the lookout for me.The building was an enormous one, rearing its lofty head fully athousand feet into the air.  But few buildings in Zodanga were higherthan these barracks, though several topped it by a few hundred feet;the docks of the great battleships of the line standing some fifteenhundred feet from the ground, while the freight and passenger stationsof the merchant squadrons rose nearly as high.It was a long climb up the face of the building, and one fraught withmuch danger, but there was no other way, and so I essayed the task.The fact that Barsoomian architecture is extremely ornate made the featmuch simpler than I had anticipated, since I found ornamental ledgesand projections which fairly formed a perfect ladder for me all the wayto the eaves of the building.  Here I met my first real obstacle.  Theeaves projected nearly twenty feet from the wall to which I clung, andthough I encircled the great building I could find no opening throughthem.The top floor was alight, and filled with soldiers engaged in thepastimes of their kind; I could not, therefore, reach the roof throughthe building.There was one slight, desperate chance, and that I decided I musttake--it was for Dejah Thoris, and no man has lived who would not riska thousand deaths for such as she.Clinging to the wall with my feet and one hand, I unloosened one of thelong leather straps of my trappings at the end of which dangled a greathook by which air sailors are hung to the sides and bottoms of theircraft for various purposes of repair, and by means of which landingparties are lowered to the ground from the battleships.I swung this hook cautiously to the roof several times before itfinally found lodgment; gently I pulled on it to strengthen its hold,but whether it would bear the weight of my body I did not know.  Itmight be barely caught upon the very outer verge of the roof, so thatas my body swung out at the end of the strap it would slip off andlaunch me to the pavement a thousand feet below.An instant I hesitated, and then, releasing my grasp upon thesupporting ornament, I swung out into space at the end of the strap.Far below me lay the brilliantly lighted streets, the hard pavements,and death.  There was a little jerk at the top of the supporting eaves,and a nasty slipping, grating sound which turned me cold withapprehension; then the hook caught and I was safe.Clambering quickly aloft I grasped the edge of the eaves and drewmyself to the surface of the roof above.  As I gained my feet I wasconfronted by the sentry on duty, into the muzzle of whose revolver Ifound myself looking.&quot;Who are you and whence came you?&quot; he cried.&quot;I am an air scout, friend, and very near a dead one, for just by themerest chance I escaped falling to the avenue below,&quot; I replied.&quot;But how came you upon the roof, man?  No one has landed or come upfrom the building for the past hour.  Quick, explain yourself, or Icall the guard.&quot;&quot;Look you here, sentry, and you shall see how I came and how close ashave I had to not coming at all,&quot; I answered, turning toward the edgeof the roof, where, twenty feet below, at the end of my strap, hung allmy weapons.The fellow, acting on impulse of curiosity, stepped to my side and tohis undoing, for as he leaned to peer over the eaves I grasped him byhis throat and his pistol arm and threw him heavily to the roof.  Theweapon dropped from his grasp, and my fingers choked off his attemptedcry for assistance.  I gagged and bound him and then hung him over theedge of the roof as I myself had hung a few moments before.  I knew itwould be morning before he would be discovered, and I needed all thetime that I could gain.Donning my trappings and weapons I hastened to the sheds, and soon hadout both my machine and Kantos Kan's.  Making his fast behind mine Istarted my engine, and skimming over the edge of the roof I dove downinto the streets of the city far below the plane usually occupied bythe air patrol.  In less than a minute I was settling safely upon theroof of our apartment beside the astonished Kantos Kan.I lost no time in explanation, but plunged immediately into adiscussion of our plans for the immediate future.  It was decided thatI was to try to make Helium while Kantos Kan was to enter the palaceand dispatch Sab Than.  If successful he was then to follow me.  He setmy compass for me, a clever little device which will remain steadfastlyfixed upon any given point on the surface of Barsoom, and bidding eachother farewell we rose together and sped in the direction of the palacewhich lay in the route which I must take to reach Helium.As we neared the high tower a patrol shot down from above, throwing itspiercing searchlight full upon my craft, and a voice roared out acommand to halt, following with a shot as I paid no attention to hishail.  Kantos Kan dropped quickly into the darkness, while I rosesteadily and at terrific speed raced through the Martian sky followedby a dozen of the air-scout craft which had joined the pursuit, andlater by a swift cruiser carrying a hundred men and a battery ofrapid-fire guns.  By twisting and turning my little machine, now risingand now falling, I managed to elude their search-lights most of thetime, but I was also losing ground by these tactics, and so I decidedto hazard everything on a straight-away course and leave the result tofate and the speed of my machine.Kantos Kan had shown me a trick of gearing, which is known only to thenavy of Helium, that greatly increased the speed of our machines, sothat I felt sure I could distance my pursuers if I could dodge theirprojectiles for a few moments.As I sped through the air the screeching of the bullets around meconvinced me that only by a miracle could I escape, but the die wascast, and throwing on full speed I raced a straight course towardHelium.  Gradually I left my pursuers further and further behind, and Iwas just congratulating myself on my lucky escape, when a well-directedshot from the cruiser exploded at the prow of my little craft.  Theconcussion nearly capsized her, and with a sickening plunge she hurtleddownward through the dark night.How far I fell before I regained control of the plane I do not know,but I must have been very close to the ground when I started to riseagain, as I plainly heard the squealing of animals below me.  Risingagain I scanned the heavens for my pursuers, and finally making outtheir lights far behind me, saw that they were landing, evidently insearch of me.Not until their lights were no longer discernible did I venture toflash my little lamp upon my compass, and then I found to myconsternation that a fragment of the projectile had utterly destroyedmy only guide, as well as my speedometer.  It was true I could followthe stars in the general direction of Helium, but without knowing theexact location of the city or the speed at which I was traveling mychances for finding it were slim.Helium lies a thousand miles southwest of Zodanga, and with my compassintact I should have made the trip, barring accidents, in between fourand five hours.  As it turned out, however, morning found me speedingover a vast expanse of dead sea bottom after nearly six hours ofcontinuous flight at high speed.  Presently a great city showed belowme, but it was not Helium, as that alone of all Barsoomian metropolisesconsists in two immense circular walled cities about seventy-five milesapart and would have been easily distinguishable from the altitude atwhich I was flying.Believing that I had come too far to the north and west, I turned backin a southeasterly direction, passing during the forenoon several otherlarge cities, but none resembling the description which Kantos Kan hadgiven me of Helium.  In addition to the twin-city formation of Helium,another distinguishing feature is the two immense towers, one of vividscarlet rising nearly a mile into the air from the center of one of thecities, while the other, of bright yellow and of the same height, marksher sister.CHAPTER XXIVTARS TARKAS FINDS A FRIENDAbout noon I passed low over a great dead city of ancient Mars, and asI skimmed out across the plain beyond I came full upon several thousandgreen warriors engaged in a terrific battle.  Scarcely had I seen themthan a volley of shots was directed at me, and with the almostunfailing accuracy of their aim my little craft was instantly a ruinedwreck, sinking erratically to the ground.I fell almost directly in the center of the fierce combat, amongwarriors who had not seen my approach so busily were they engaged inlife and death struggles.  The men were fighting on foot withlong-swords, while an occasional shot from a sharpshooter on theoutskirts of the conflict would bring down a warrior who might for aninstant separate himself from the entangled mass.As my machine sank among them I realized that it was fight or die, withgood chances of dying in any event, and so I struck the ground withdrawn long-sword ready to defend myself as I could.I fell beside a huge monster who was engaged with three antagonists,and as I glanced at his fierce face, filled with the light of battle, Irecognized Tars Tarkas the Thark.  He did not see me, as I was a triflebehind him, and just then the three warriors opposing him, and whom Irecognized as Warhoons, charged simultaneously.  The mighty fellow madequick work of one of them, but in stepping back for another thrust hefell over a dead body behind him and was down and at the mercy of hisfoes in an instant.  Quick as lightning they were upon him, and TarsTarkas would have been gathered to his fathers in short order had I notsprung before his prostrate form and engaged his adversaries.  I hadaccounted for one of them when the mighty Thark regained his feet andquickly settled the other.He gave me one look, and a slight smile touched his grim lip as,touching my shoulder, he said,&quot;I would scarcely recognize you, John Carter, but there is no othermortal upon Barsoom who would have done what you have for me.  I thinkI have learned that there is such a thing as friendship, my friend.&quot;He said no more, nor was there opportunity, for the Warhoons wereclosing in about us, and together we fought, shoulder to shoulder,during all that long, hot afternoon, until the tide of battle turnedand the remnant of the fierce Warhoon horde fell back upon theirthoats, and fled into the gathering darkness.Ten thousand men had been engaged in that titanic struggle, and uponthe field of battle lay three thousand dead.  Neither side asked orgave quarter, nor did they attempt to take prisoners.On our return to the city after the battle we had gone directly to TarsTarkas' quarters, where I was left alone while the chieftain attendedthe customary council which immediately follows an engagement.As I sat awaiting the return of the green warrior I heard somethingmove in an adjoining apartment, and as I glanced up there rushedsuddenly upon me a huge and hideous creature which bore me backwardupon the pile of silks and furs upon which I had been reclining.  Itwas Woola--faithful, loving Woola.  He had found his way back to Tharkand, as Tars Tarkas later told me, had gone immediately to my formerquarters where he had taken up his pathetic and seemingly hopelesswatch for my return.&quot;Tal Hajus knows that you are here, John Carter,&quot; said Tars Tarkas, onhis return from the jeddak's quarters; &quot;Sarkoja saw and recognized youas we were returning.  Tal Hajus has ordered me to bring you before himtonight.  I have ten thoats, John Carter; you may take your choice fromamong them, and I will accompany you to the nearest waterway that leadsto Helium.  Tars Tarkas may be a cruel green warrior, but he can be afriend as well.  Come, we must start.&quot;&quot;And when you return, Tars Tarkas?&quot; I asked.&quot;The wild calots, possibly, or worse,&quot; he replied.  &quot;Unless I shouldchance to have the opportunity I have so long waited of battling withTal Hajus.&quot;&quot;We will stay, Tars Tarkas, and see Tal Hajus tonight.  You shall notsacrifice yourself, and it may be that tonight you can have the chanceyou wait.&quot;He objected strenuously, saying that Tal Hajus often flew into wildfits of passion at the mere thought of the blow I had dealt him, andthat if ever he laid his hands upon me I would be subjected to the mosthorrible tortures.While we were eating I repeated to Tars Tarkas the story which Sola hadtold me that night upon the sea bottom during the march to Thark.He said but little, but the great muscles of his face worked in passionand in agony at recollection of the horrors which had been heaped uponthe only thing he had ever loved in all his cold, cruel, terribleexistence.He no longer demurred when I suggested that we go before Tal Hajus,only saying that he would like to speak to Sarkoja first.  At hisrequest I accompanied him to her quarters, and the look of venomoushatred she cast upon me was almost adequate recompense for any futuremisfortunes this accidental return to Thark might bring me.&quot;Sarkoja,&quot; said Tars Tarkas, &quot;forty years ago you were instrumental inbringing about the torture and death of a woman named Gozava.  I havejust discovered that the warrior who loved that woman has learned ofyour part in the transaction.  He may not kill you, Sarkoja, it is notour custom, but there is nothing to prevent him tying one end of astrap about your neck and the other end to a wild thoat, merely to testyour fitness to survive and help perpetuate our race.  Having heardthat he would do this on the morrow, I thought it only right to warnyou, for I am a just man.  The river Iss is but a short pilgrimage,Sarkoja.  Come, John Carter.&quot;The next morning Sarkoja was gone, nor was she ever seen after.In silence we hastened to the jeddak's palace, where we wereimmediately admitted to his presence; in fact, he could scarcely waitto see me and was standing erect upon his platform glowering at theentrance as I came in.&quot;Strap him to that pillar,&quot; he shrieked.  &quot;We shall see who it is daresstrike the mighty Tal Hajus.  Heat the irons; with my own hands I shallburn the eyes from his head that he may not pollute my person with hisvile gaze.&quot;&quot;Chieftains of Thark,&quot; I cried, turning to the assembled council andignoring Tal Hajus, &quot;I have been a chief among you, and today I havefought for Thark shoulder to shoulder with her greatest warrior.  Youowe me, at least, a hearing.  I have won that much today.  You claim tobe just people--&quot;&quot;Silence,&quot; roared Tal Hajus.  &quot;Gag the creature and bind him as Icommand.&quot;&quot;Justice, Tal Hajus,&quot; exclaimed Lorquas Ptomel.  &quot;Who are you to setaside the customs of ages among the Tharks.&quot;&quot;Yes, justice!&quot; echoed a dozen voices, and so, while Tal Hajus fumedand frothed, I continued.&quot;You are a brave people and you love bravery, but where was your mightyjeddak during the fighting today?  I did not see him in the thick ofbattle; he was not there.  He rends defenseless women and littlechildren in his lair, but how recently has one of you seen him fightwith men?  Why, even I, a midget beside him, felled him with a singleblow of my fist.  Is it of such that the Tharks fashion their jeddaks?There stands beside me now a great Thark, a mighty warrior and a nobleman.  Chieftains, how sounds, Tars Tarkas, Jeddak of Thark?&quot;A roar of deep-toned applause greeted this suggestion.&quot;It but remains for this council to command, and Tal Hajus must provehis fitness to rule.  Were he a brave man he would invite Tars Tarkasto combat, for he does not love him, but Tal Hajus is afraid; TalHajus, your jeddak, is a coward.  With my bare hands I could kill him,and he knows it.&quot;After I ceased there was tense silence, as all eyes were riveted uponTal Hajus.  He did not speak or move, but the blotchy green of hiscountenance turned livid, and the froth froze upon his lips.&quot;Tal Hajus,&quot; said Lorquas Ptomel in a cold, hard voice, &quot;never in mylong life have I seen a jeddak of the Tharks so humiliated.  Therecould be but one answer to this arraignment.  We wait it.&quot;  And stillTal Hajus stood as though petrified.&quot;Chieftains,&quot; continued Lorquas Ptomel, &quot;shall the jeddak, Tal Hajus,prove his fitness to rule over Tars Tarkas?&quot;There were twenty chieftains about the rostrum, and twenty swordsflashed high in assent.There was no alternative.  That decree was final, and so Tal Hajus drewhis long-sword and advanced to meet Tars Tarkas.The combat was soon over, and, with his foot upon the neck of the deadmonster, Tars Tarkas became jeddak among the Tharks.His first act was to make me a full-fledged chieftain with the rank Ihad won by my combats the first few weeks of my captivity among them.Seeing the favorable disposition of the warriors toward Tars Tarkas, aswell as toward me, I grasped the opportunity to enlist them in my causeagainst Zodanga.  I told Tars Tarkas the story of my adventures, and ina few words had explained to him the thought I had in mind.&quot;John Carter has made a proposal,&quot; he said, addressing the council,&quot;which meets with my sanction.  I shall put it to you briefly.  DejahThoris, the Princess of Helium, who was our prisoner, is now held bythe jeddak of Zodanga, whose son she must wed to save her country fromdevastation at the hands of the Zodangan forces.&quot;John Carter suggests that we rescue her and return her to Helium.  Theloot of Zodanga would be magnificent, and I have often thought that hadwe an alliance with the people of Helium we could obtain sufficientassurance of sustenance to permit us to increase the size and frequencyof our hatchings, and thus become unquestionably supreme among thegreen men of all Barsoom.  What say you?&quot;It was a chance to fight, an opportunity to loot, and they rose to thebait as a speckled trout to a fly.For Tharks they were wildly enthusiastic, and before another half hourhad passed twenty mounted messengers were speeding across dead seabottoms to call the hordes together for the expedition.In three days we were on the march toward Zodanga, one hundred thousandstrong, as Tars Tarkas had been able to enlist the services of threesmaller hordes on the promise of the great loot of Zodanga.At the head of the column I rode beside the great Thark while at theheels of my mount trotted my beloved Woola.We traveled entirely by night, timing our marches so that we campedduring the day at deserted cities where, even to the beasts, we wereall kept indoors during the daylight hours.  On the march Tars Tarkas,through his remarkable ability and statesmanship, enlisted fiftythousand more warriors from various hordes, so that, ten days after weset out we halted at midnight outside the great walled city of Zodanga,one hundred and fifty thousand strong.The fighting strength and efficiency of this horde of ferocious greenmonsters was equivalent to ten times their number of red men.  Never inthe history of Barsoom, Tars Tarkas told me, had such a force of greenwarriors marched to battle together.  It was a monstrous task to keepeven a semblance of harmony among them, and it was a marvel to me thathe got them to the city without a mighty battle among themselves.But as we neared Zodanga their personal quarrels were submerged bytheir greater hatred for the red men, and especially for the Zodangans,who had for years waged a ruthless campaign of extermination againstthe green men, directing special attention toward despoiling theirincubators.Now that we were before Zodanga the task of obtaining entry to the citydevolved upon me, and directing Tars Tarkas to hold his forces in twodivisions out of earshot of the city, with each division opposite alarge gateway, I took twenty dismounted warriors and approached one ofthe small gates that pierced the walls at short intervals.  These gateshave no regular guard, but are covered by sentries, who patrol theavenue that encircles the city just within the walls as ourmetropolitan police patrol their beats.The walls of Zodanga are seventy-five feet in height and fifty feetthick.  They are built of enormous blocks of carborundum, and the taskof entering the city seemed, to my escort of green warriors, animpossibility.  The fellows who had been detailed to accompany me wereof one of the smaller hordes, and therefore did not know me.Placing three of them with their faces to the wall and arms locked, Icommanded two more to mount to their shoulders, and a sixth I orderedto climb upon the shoulders of the upper two.  The head of the topmostwarrior towered over forty feet from the ground.In this way, with ten warriors, I built a series of three steps fromthe ground to the shoulders of the topmost man.  Then starting from ashort distance behind them I ran swiftly up from one tier to the next,and with a final bound from the broad shoulders of the highest Iclutched the top of the great wall and quietly drew myself to its broadexpanse.  After me I dragged six lengths of leather from an equalnumber of my warriors.  These lengths we had previously fastenedtogether, and passing one end to the topmost warrior I lowered theother end cautiously over the opposite side of the wall toward theavenue below.  No one was in sight, so, lowering myself to the end ofmy leather strap, I dropped the remaining thirty feet to the pavementbelow.I had learned from Kantos Kan the secret of opening these gates, and inanother moment my twenty great fighting men stood within the doomedcity of Zodanga.I found to my delight that I had entered at the lower boundary of theenormous palace grounds.  The building itself showed in the distance ablaze of glorious light, and on the instant I determined to lead adetachment of warriors directly within the palace itself, while thebalance of the great horde was attacking the barracks of the soldiery.Dispatching one of my men to Tars Tarkas for a detail of fifty Tharks,with word of my intentions, I ordered ten warriors to capture and openone of the great gates while with the nine remaining I took the other.We were to do our work quietly, no shots were to be fired and nogeneral advance made until I had reached the palace with my fiftyTharks.  Our plans worked to perfection.  The two sentries we met weredispatched to their fathers upon the banks of the lost sea of Korus,and the guards at both gates followed them in silence.CHAPTER XXVTHE LOOTING OF ZODANGAAs the great gate where I stood swung open my fifty Tharks, headed byTars Tarkas himself, rode in upon their mighty thoats.  I led them tothe palace walls, which I negotiated easily without assistance.  Onceinside, however, the gate gave me considerable trouble, but I finallywas rewarded by seeing it swing upon its huge hinges, and soon myfierce escort was riding across the gardens of the jeddak of Zodanga.As we approached the palace I could see through the great windows ofthe first floor into the brilliantly illuminated audience chamber ofThan Kosis.  The immense hall was crowded with nobles and their women,as though some important function was in progress.  There was not aguard in sight without the palace, due, I presume, to the fact that thecity and palace walls were considered impregnable, and so I came closeand peered within.At one end of the chamber, upon massive golden thrones encrusted withdiamonds, sat Than Kosis and his consort, surrounded by officers anddignitaries of state.  Before them stretched a broad aisle lined oneither side with soldiery, and as I looked there entered this aisle atthe far end of the hall, the head of a procession which advanced to thefoot of the throne.First there marched four officers of the jeddak's Guard bearing a hugesalver on which reposed, upon a cushion of scarlet silk, a great goldenchain with a collar and padlock at each end.  Directly behind theseofficers came four others carrying a similar salver which supported themagnificent ornaments of a prince and princess of the reigning house ofZodanga.At the foot of the throne these two parties separated and halted,facing each other at opposite sides of the aisle.  Then came moredignitaries, and the officers of the palace and of the army, andfinally two figures entirely muffled in scarlet silk, so that not afeature of either was discernible.  These two stopped at the foot ofthe throne, facing Than Kosis.  When the balance of the procession hadentered and assumed their stations Than Kosis addressed the couplestanding before him.  I could not hear his words, but presently twoofficers advanced and removed the scarlet robe from one of the figures,and I saw that Kantos Kan had failed in his mission, for it was SabThan, Prince of Zodanga, who stood revealed before me.Than Kosis now took a set of the ornaments from one of the salvers andplaced one of the collars of gold about his son's neck, springing thepadlock fast.  After a few more words addressed to Sab Than he turnedto the other figure, from which the officers now removed theenshrouding silks, disclosing to my now comprehending view DejahThoris, Princess of Helium.The object of the ceremony was clear to me; in another moment DejahThoris would be joined forever to the Prince of Zodanga.  It was animpressive and beautiful ceremony, I presume, but to me it seemed themost fiendish sight I had ever witnessed, and as the ornaments wereadjusted upon her beautiful figure and her collar of gold swung open inthe hands of Than Kosis I raised my long-sword above my head, and, withthe heavy hilt, I shattered the glass of the great window and spranginto the midst of the astonished assemblage.  With a bound I was on thesteps of the platform beside Than Kosis, and as he stood riveted withsurprise I brought my long-sword down upon the golden chain that wouldhave bound Dejah Thoris to another.In an instant all was confusion; a thousand drawn swords menaced mefrom every quarter, and Sab Than sprang upon me with a jeweled daggerhe had drawn from his nuptial ornaments.  I could have killed him aseasily as I might a fly, but the age-old custom of Barsoom stayed myhand, and grasping his wrist as the dagger flew toward my heart I heldhim as though in a vise and with my long-sword pointed to the far endof the hall.&quot;Zodanga has fallen,&quot; I cried.  &quot;Look!&quot;All eyes turned in the direction I had indicated, and there, forgingthrough the portals of the entranceway rode Tars Tarkas and his fiftywarriors on their great thoats.A cry of alarm and amazement broke from the assemblage, but no word offear, and in a moment the soldiers and nobles of Zodanga were hurlingthemselves upon the advancing Tharks.Thrusting Sab Than headlong from the platform, I drew Dejah Thoris tomy side.  Behind the throne was a narrow doorway and in this Than Kosisnow stood facing me, with drawn long-sword.  In an instant we wereengaged, and I found no mean antagonist.As we circled upon the broad platform I saw Sab Than rushing up thesteps to aid his father, but, as he raised his hand to strike, DejahThoris sprang before him and then my sword found the spot that made SabThan jeddak of Zodanga.  As his father rolled dead upon the floor thenew jeddak tore himself free from Dejah Thoris' grasp, and again wefaced each other.  He was soon joined by a quartet of officers, and,with my back against a golden throne, I fought once again for DejahThoris.  I was hard pressed to defend myself and yet not strike downSab Than and, with him, my last chance to win the woman I loved.  Myblade was swinging with the rapidity of lightning as I sought to parrythe thrusts and cuts of my opponents.  Two I had disarmed, and one wasdown, when several more rushed to the aid of their new ruler, and toavenge the death of the old.As they advanced there were cries of &quot;The woman!  The woman!  Strikeher down; it is her plot.  Kill her!  Kill her!&quot;Calling to Dejah Thoris to get behind me I worked my way toward thelittle doorway back of the throne, but the officers realized myintentions, and three of them sprang in behind me and blocked mychances for gaining a position where I could have defended Dejah Thorisagainst an army of swordsmen.The Tharks were having their hands full in the center of the room, andI began to realize that nothing short of a miracle could save DejahThoris and myself, when I saw Tars Tarkas surging through the crowd ofpygmies that swarmed about him.  With one swing of his mighty longswordhe laid a dozen corpses at his feet, and so he hewed a pathway beforehim until in another moment he stood upon the platform beside me,dealing death and destruction right and left.The bravery of the Zodangans was awe-inspiring, not one attempted toescape, and when the fighting ceased it was because only Tharksremained alive in the great hall, other than Dejah Thoris and myself.Sab Than lay dead beside his father, and the corpses of the flower ofZodangan nobility and chivalry covered the floor of the bloody shambles.My first thought when the battle was over was for Kantos Kan, andleaving Dejah Thoris in charge of Tars Tarkas I took a dozen warriorsand hastened to the dungeons beneath the palace.  The jailers had allleft to join the fighters in the throne room, so we searched thelabyrinthine prison without opposition.I called Kantos Kan's name aloud in each new corridor and compartment,and finally I was rewarded by hearing a faint response.  Guided by thesound, we soon found him helpless in a dark recess.He was overjoyed at seeing me, and to know the meaning of the fight,faint echoes of which had reached his prison cell.  He told me that theair patrol had captured him before he reached the high tower of thepalace, so that he had not even seen Sab Than.We discovered that it would be futile to attempt to cut away the barsand chains which held him prisoner, so, at his suggestion I returned tosearch the bodies on the floor above for keys to open the padlocks ofhis cell and of his chains.Fortunately among the first I examined I found his jailer, and soon wehad Kantos Kan with us in the throne room.The sounds of heavy firing, mingled with shouts and cries, came to usfrom the city's streets, and Tars Tarkas hastened away to direct thefighting without.  Kantos Kan accompanied him to act as guide, thegreen warriors commencing a thorough search of the palace for otherZodangans and for loot, and Dejah Thoris and I were left alone.She had sunk into one of the golden thrones, and as I turned to her shegreeted me with a wan smile.&quot;Was there ever such a man!&quot; she exclaimed.  &quot;I know that Barsoom hasnever before seen your like.  Can it be that all Earth men are as you?Alone, a stranger, hunted, threatened, persecuted, you have done in afew short months what in all the past ages of Barsoom no man has everdone: joined together the wild hordes of the sea bottoms and broughtthem to fight as allies of a red Martian people.&quot;&quot;The answer is easy, Dejah Thoris,&quot; I replied smiling.  &quot;It was not Iwho did it, it was love, love for Dejah Thoris, a power that would workgreater miracles than this you have seen.&quot;A pretty flush overspread her face and she answered,&quot;You may say that now, John Carter, and I may listen, for I am free.&quot;&quot;And more still I have to say, ere it is again too late,&quot; I returned.&quot;I have done many strange things in my life, many things that wiser menwould not have dared, but never in my wildest fancies have I dreamed ofwinning a Dejah Thoris for myself--for never had I dreamed that in allthe universe dwelt such a woman as the Princess of Helium.  That youare a princess does not abash me, but that you are you is enough tomake me doubt my sanity as I ask you, my princess, to be mine.&quot;&quot;He does not need to be abashed who so well knew the answer to his pleabefore the plea were made,&quot; she replied, rising and placing her dearhands upon my shoulders, and so I took her in my arms and kissed her.And thus in the midst of a city of wild conflict, filled with thealarms of war; with death and destruction reaping their terribleharvest around her, did Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium, true daughterof Mars, the God of War, promise herself in marriage to John Carter,Gentleman of Virginia.CHAPTER XXVITHROUGH CARNAGE TO JOYSometime later Tars Tarkas and Kantos Kan returned to report thatZodanga had been completely reduced.  Her forces were entirelydestroyed or captured, and no further resistance was to be expectedfrom within.  Several battleships had escaped, but there were thousandsof war and merchant vessels under guard of Thark warriors.The lesser hordes had commenced looting and quarreling amongthemselves, so it was decided that we collect what warriors we could,man as many vessels as possible with Zodangan prisoners and make forHelium without further loss of time.Five hours later we sailed from the roofs of the dock buildings with afleet of two hundred and fifty battleships, carrying nearly one hundredthousand green warriors, followed by a fleet of transports with ourthoats.Behind us we left the stricken city in the fierce and brutal clutchesof some forty thousand green warriors of the lesser hordes.  They werelooting, murdering, and fighting amongst themselves.  In a hundredplaces they had applied the torch, and columns of dense smoke wererising above the city as though to blot out from the eye of heaven thehorrid sights beneath.In the middle of the afternoon we sighted the scarlet and yellow towersof Helium, and a short time later a great fleet of Zodangan battleshipsrose from the camps of the besiegers without the city, and advanced tomeet us.The banners of Helium had been strung from stem to stern of each of ourmighty craft, but the Zodangans did not need this sign to realize thatwe were enemies, for our green Martian warriors had opened fire uponthem almost as they left the ground.  With their uncanny marksmanshipthey raked the on-coming fleet with volley after volley.The twin cities of Helium, perceiving that we were friends, sent outhundreds of vessels to aid us, and then began the first real air battleI had ever witnessed.The vessels carrying our green warriors were kept circling above thecontending fleets of Helium and Zodanga, since their batteries wereuseless in the hands of the Tharks who, having no navy, have no skillin naval gunnery.  Their small-arm fire, however, was most effective,and the final outcome of the engagement was strongly influenced, if notwholly determined, by their presence.At first the two forces circled at the same altitude, pouring broadsideafter broadside into each other.  Presently a great hole was torn inthe hull of one of the immense battle craft from the Zodangan camp;with a lurch she turned completely over, the little figures of her crewplunging, turning and twisting toward the ground a thousand feet below;then with sickening velocity she tore after them, almost completelyburying herself in the soft loam of the ancient sea bottom.A wild cry of exultation arose from the Heliumite squadron, and withredoubled ferocity they fell upon the Zodangan fleet.  By a prettymaneuver two of the vessels of Helium gained a position above theiradversaries, from which they poured upon them from their keel bombbatteries a perfect torrent of exploding bombs.Then, one by one, the battleships of Helium succeeded in rising abovethe Zodangans, and in a short time a number of the beleagueringbattleships were drifting hopeless wrecks toward the high scarlet towerof greater Helium.  Several others attempted to escape, but they weresoon surrounded by thousands of tiny individual fliers, and above eachhung a monster battleship of Helium ready to drop boarding parties upontheir decks.Within but little more than an hour from the moment the victoriousZodangan squadron had risen to meet us from the camp of the besiegersthe battle was over, and the remaining vessels of the conqueredZodangans were headed toward the cities of Helium under prize crews.There was an extremely pathetic side to the surrender of these mightyfliers, the result of an age-old custom which demanded that surrendershould be signalized by the voluntary plunging to earth of thecommander of the vanquished vessel.  One after another the bravefellows, holding their colors high above their heads, leaped from thetowering bows of their mighty craft to an awful death.Not until the commander of the entire fleet took the fearful plunge,thus indicating the surrender of the remaining vessels, did thefighting cease, and the useless sacrifice of brave men come to an end.We now signaled the flagship of Helium's navy to approach, and when shewas within hailing distance I called out that we had the Princess DejahThoris on board, and that we wished to transfer her to the flagshipthat she might be taken immediately to the city.As the full import of my announcement bore in upon them a great cryarose from the decks of the flagship, and a moment later the colors ofthe Princess of Helium broke from a hundred points upon her upperworks.  When the other vessels of the squadron caught the meaning ofthe signals flashed them they took up the wild acclaim and unfurled hercolors in the gleaming sunlight.The flagship bore down upon us, and as she swung gracefully to andtouched our side a dozen officers sprang upon our decks.  As theirastonished gaze fell upon the hundreds of green warriors, who now cameforth from the fighting shelters, they stopped aghast, but at sight ofKantos Kan, who advanced to meet them, they came forward, crowdingabout him.Dejah Thoris and I then advanced, and they had no eyes for other thanher.  She received them gracefully, calling each by name, for they weremen high in the esteem and service of her grandfather, and she knewthem well.&quot;Lay your hands upon the shoulder of John Carter,&quot; she said to them,turning toward me, &quot;the man to whom Helium owes her princess as well asher victory today.&quot;They were very courteous to me and said many kind and complimentarythings, but what seemed to impress them most was that I had won the aidof the fierce Tharks in my campaign for the liberation of Dejah Thoris,and the relief of Helium.&quot;You owe your thanks more to another man than to me,&quot; I said, &quot;and herehe is; meet one of Barsoom's greatest soldiers and statesmen, TarsTarkas, Jeddak of Thark.&quot;With the same polished courtesy that had marked their manner toward methey extended their greetings to the great Thark, nor, to my surprise,was he much behind them in ease of bearing or in courtly speech.Though not a garrulous race, the Tharks are extremely formal, and theirways lend themselves amazingly to dignified and courtly manners.Dejah Thoris went aboard the flagship, and was much put out that Iwould not follow, but, as I explained to her, the battle was but partlywon; we still had the land forces of the besieging Zodangans to accountfor, and I would not leave Tars Tarkas until that had been accomplished.The commander of the naval forces of Helium promised to arrange to havethe armies of Helium attack from the city in conjunction with our landattack, and so the vessels separated and Dejah Thoris was borne intriumph back to the court of her grandfather, Tardos Mors, Jeddak ofHelium.In the distance lay our fleet of transports, with the thoats of thegreen warriors, where they had remained during the battle.  Withoutlanding stages it was to be a difficult matter to unload these beastsupon the open plain, but there was nothing else for it, and so we putout for a point about ten miles from the city and began the task.It was necessary to lower the animals to the ground in slings and thiswork occupied the remainder of the day and half the night.  Twice wewere attacked by parties of Zodangan cavalry, but with little loss,however, and after darkness shut down they withdrew.As soon as the last thoat was unloaded Tars Tarkas gave the command toadvance, and in three parties we crept upon the Zodangan camp from thenorth, the south and the east.About a mile from the main camp we encountered their outposts and, ashad been prearranged, accepted this as the signal to charge.  Withwild, ferocious cries and amidst the nasty squealing of battle-enragedthoats we bore down upon the Zodangans.We did not catch them napping, but found a well-entrenched battle lineconfronting us.  Time after time we were repulsed until, toward noon, Ibegan to fear for the result of the battle.The Zodangans numbered nearly a million fighting men, gathered frompole to pole, wherever stretched their ribbon-like waterways, whilepitted against them were less than a hundred thousand green warriors.The forces from Helium had not arrived, nor could we receive any wordfrom them.Just at noon we heard heavy firing all along the line between theZodangans and the cities, and we knew then that our much-neededreinforcements had come.Again Tars Tarkas ordered the charge, and once more the mighty thoatsbore their terrible riders against the ramparts of the enemy.  At thesame moment the battle line of Helium surged over the oppositebreastworks of the Zodangans and in another moment they were beingcrushed as between two millstones.  Nobly they fought, but in vain.The plain before the city became a veritable shambles ere the lastZodangan surrendered, but finally the carnage ceased, the prisonerswere marched back to Helium, and we entered the greater city's gates, ahuge triumphal procession of conquering heroes.The broad avenues were lined with women and children, among which werethe few men whose duties necessitated that they remain within the cityduring the battle.  We were greeted with an endless round of applauseand showered with ornaments of gold, platinum, silver, and preciousjewels.  The city had gone mad with joy.My fierce Tharks caused the wildest excitement and enthusiasm.  Neverbefore had an armed body of green warriors entered the gates of Helium,and that they came now as friends and allies filled the red men withrejoicing.That my poor services to Dejah Thoris had become known to theHeliumites was evidenced by the loud crying of my name, and by theloads of ornaments that were fastened upon me and my huge thoat as wepassed up the avenues to the palace, for even in the face of theferocious appearance of Woola the populace pressed close about me.As we approached this magnificent pile we were met by a party ofofficers who greeted us warmly and requested that Tars Tarkas and hisjeds with the jeddaks and jeds of his wild allies, together withmyself, dismount and accompany them to receive from Tardos Mors anexpression of his gratitude for our services.At the top of the great steps leading up to the main portals of thepalace stood the royal party, and as we reached the lower steps one oftheir number descended to meet us.He was an almost perfect specimen of manhood; tall, straight as anarrow, superbly muscled and with the carriage and bearing of a ruler ofmen.  I did not need to be told that he was Tardos Mors, Jeddak ofHelium.The first member of our party he met was Tars Tarkas and his firstwords sealed forever the new friendship between the races.&quot;That Tardos Mors,&quot; he said, earnestly, &quot;may meet the greatest livingwarrior of Barsoom is a priceless honor, but that he may lay his handon the shoulder of a friend and ally is a far greater boon.&quot;&quot;Jeddak of Helium,&quot; returned Tars Tarkas, &quot;it has remained for a man ofanother world to teach the green warriors of Barsoom the meaning offriendship; to him we owe the fact that the hordes of Thark canunderstand you; that they can appreciate and reciprocate the sentimentsso graciously expressed.&quot;Tardos Mors then greeted each of the green jeddaks and jeds, and toeach spoke words of friendship and appreciation.As he approached me he laid both hands upon my shoulders.&quot;Welcome, my son,&quot; he said; &quot;that you are granted, gladly, and withoutone word of opposition, the most precious jewel in all Helium, yes, onall Barsoom, is sufficient earnest of my esteem.&quot;We were then presented to Mors Kajak, Jed of lesser Helium, and fatherof Dejah Thoris.  He had followed close behind Tardos Mors and seemedeven more affected by the meeting than had his father.He tried a dozen times to express his gratitude to me, but his voicechoked with emotion and he could not speak, and yet he had, as I was tolater learn, a reputation for ferocity and fearlessness as a fighterthat was remarkable even upon warlike Barsoom.  In common with allHelium he worshiped his daughter, nor could he think of what she hadescaped without deep emotion.CHAPTER XXVIIFROM JOY TO DEATHFor ten days the hordes of Thark and their wild allies were feasted andentertained, and, then, loaded with costly presents and escorted by tenthousand soldiers of Helium commanded by Mors Kajak, they started onthe return journey to their own lands.  The jed of lesser Helium with asmall party of nobles accompanied them all the way to Thark to cementmore closely the new bonds of peace and friendship.Sola also accompanied Tars Tarkas, her father, who before all hischieftains had acknowledged her as his daughter.Three weeks later, Mors Kajak and his officers, accompanied by TarsTarkas and Sola, returned upon a battleship that had been dispatched toThark to fetch them in time for the ceremony which made Dejah Thorisand John Carter one.For nine years I served in the councils and fought in the armies ofHelium as a prince of the house of Tardos Mors.  The people seemednever to tire of heaping honors upon me, and no day passed that did notbring some new proof of their love for my princess, the incomparableDejah Thoris.In a golden incubator upon the roof of our palace lay a snow-white egg.For nearly five years ten soldiers of the jeddak's Guard had constantlystood over it, and not a day passed when I was in the city that DejahThoris and I did not stand hand in hand before our little shrineplanning for the future, when the delicate shell should break.Vivid in my memory is the picture of the last night as we sat theretalking in low tones of the strange romance which had woven our livestogether and of this wonder which was coming to augment our happinessand fulfill our hopes.In the distance we saw the bright-white light of an approachingairship, but we attached no special significance to so common a sight.Like a bolt of lightning it raced toward Helium until its very speedbespoke the unusual.Flashing the signals which proclaimed it a dispatch bearer for thejeddak, it circled impatiently awaiting the tardy patrol boat whichmust convoy it to the palace docks.Ten minutes after it touched at the palace a message called me to thecouncil chamber, which I found filling with the members of that body.On the raised platform of the throne was Tardos Mors, pacing back andforth with tense-drawn face.  When all were in their seats he turnedtoward us.&quot;This morning,&quot; he said, &quot;word reached the several governments ofBarsoom that the keeper of the atmosphere plant had made no wirelessreport for two days, nor had almost ceaseless calls upon him from ascore of capitals elicited a sign of response.&quot;The ambassadors of the other nations asked us to take the matter inhand and hasten the assistant keeper to the plant.  All day a thousandcruisers have been searching for him until just now one of them returnsbearing his dead body, which was found in the pits beneath his househorribly mutilated by some assassin.&quot;I do not need to tell you what this means to Barsoom.  It would takemonths to penetrate those mighty walls, in fact the work has alreadycommenced, and there would be little to fear were the engine of thepumping plant to run as it should and as they all have for hundreds ofyears; but the worst, we fear, has happened.  The instruments showa rapidly decreasing air pressure on all parts of Barsoom--the enginehas stopped.&quot;&quot;My gentlemen,&quot; he concluded, &quot;we have at best three days to live.&quot;There was absolute silence for several minutes, and then a young noblearose, and with his drawn sword held high above his head addressedTardos Mors.&quot;The men of Helium have prided themselves that they have ever shownBarsoom how a nation of red men should live, now is our opportunity toshow them how they should die.  Let us go about our duties as though athousand useful years still lay before us.&quot;The chamber rang with applause and as there was nothing better to dothan to allay the fears of the people by our example we went our wayswith smiles upon our faces and sorrow gnawing at our hearts.When I returned to my palace I found that the rumor already had reachedDejah Thoris, so I told her all that I had heard.&quot;We have been very happy, John Carter,&quot; she said, &quot;and I thank whateverfate overtakes us that it permits us to die together.&quot;The next two days brought no noticeable change in the supply of air,but on the morning of the third day breathing became difficult at thehigher altitudes of the rooftops.  The avenues and plazas of Heliumwere filled with people.  All business had ceased.  For the most partthe people looked bravely into the face of their unalterable doom.Here and there, however, men and women gave way to quiet grief.Toward the middle of the day many of the weaker commenced to succumband within an hour the people of Barsoom were sinking by thousands intothe unconsciousness which precedes death by asphyxiation.Dejah Thoris and I with the other members of the royal family hadcollected in a sunken garden within an inner courtyard of the palace.We conversed in low tones, when we conversed at all, as the awe of thegrim shadow of death crept over us.  Even Woola seemed to feel theweight of the impending calamity, for he pressed close to Dejah Thorisand to me, whining pitifully.The little incubator had been brought from the roof of our palace atrequest of Dejah Thoris and she sat gazing longingly upon theunknown little life that now she would never know.As it was becoming perceptibly difficult to breathe Tardos Mors arose,saying,&quot;Let us bid each other farewell.  The days of the greatness of Barsoomare over.  Tomorrow's sun will look down upon a dead world whichthrough all eternity must go swinging through the heavens peopled noteven by memories.  It is the end.&quot;He stooped and kissed the women of his family, and laid his strong handupon the shoulders of the men.As I turned sadly from him my eyes fell upon Dejah Thoris.  Her headwas drooping upon her breast, to all appearances she was lifeless.With a cry I sprang to her and raised her in my arms.Her eyes opened and looked into mine.&quot;Kiss me, John Carter,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;I love you!  I love you!  It iscruel that we must be torn apart who were just starting upon a life oflove and happiness.&quot;As I pressed her dear lips to mine the old feeling of unconquerablepower and authority rose in me.  The fighting blood of Virginia sprangto life in my veins.&quot;It shall not be, my princess,&quot; I cried.  &quot;There is, there must be someway, and John Carter, who has fought his way through a strange worldfor love of you, will find it.&quot;And with my words there crept above the threshold of my conscious minda series of nine long forgotten sounds.  Like a flash of lightning inthe darkness their full purport dawned upon me--the key to the threegreat doors of the atmosphere plant!Turning suddenly toward Tardos Mors as I still clasped my dying love tomy breast I cried.&quot;A flier, Jeddak!  Quick!  Order your swiftest flier to the palace top.I can save Barsoom yet.&quot;He did not wait to question, but in an instant a guard was racing tothe nearest dock and though the air was thin and almost gone at therooftop they managed to launch the fastest one-man, air-scout machinethat the skill of Barsoom had ever produced.Kissing Dejah Thoris a dozen times and commanding Woola, who would havefollowed me, to remain and guard her, I bounded with my old agility andstrength to the high ramparts of the palace, and in another moment Iwas headed toward the goal of the hopes of all Barsoom.I had to fly low to get sufficient air to breathe, but I took astraight course across an old sea bottom and so had to rise only a fewfeet above the ground.I traveled with awful velocity for my errand was a race against timewith death.  The face of Dejah Thoris hung always before me.  As Iturned for a last look as I left the palace garden I had seen herstagger and sink upon the ground beside the little incubator.  That shehad dropped into the last coma which would end in death, if the airsupply remained unreplenished, I well knew, and so, throwing caution tothe winds, I flung overboard everything but the engine and compass,even to my ornaments, and lying on my belly along the deck with onehand on the steering wheel and the other pushing the speed lever to itslast notch I split the thin air of dying Mars with the speed of ameteor.An hour before dark the great walls of the atmosphere plant loomedsuddenly before me, and with a sickening thud I plunged to the groundbefore the small door which was withholding the spark of life from theinhabitants of an entire planet.Beside the door a great crew of men had been laboring to pierce thewall, but they had scarcely scratched the flint-like surface, and nowmost of them lay in the last sleep from which not even air would awakenthem.Conditions seemed much worse here than at Helium, and it was withdifficulty that I breathed at all.  There were a few men stillconscious, and to one of these I spoke.&quot;If I can open these doors is there a man who can start the engines?&quot; Iasked.&quot;I can,&quot; he replied, &quot;if you open quickly.  I can last but a fewmoments more.  But it is useless, they are both dead and no one elseupon Barsoom knew the secret of these awful locks.  For three days mencrazed with fear have surged about this portal in vain attempts tosolve its mystery.&quot;I had no time to talk, I was becoming very weak and it was withdifficulty that I controlled my mind at all.But, with a final effort, as I sank weakly to my knees I hurled thenine thought waves at that awful thing before me.  The Martian hadcrawled to my side and with staring eyes fixed on the single panelbefore us we waited in the silence of death.Slowly the mighty door receded before us.  I attempted to rise andfollow it but I was too weak.&quot;After it,&quot; I cried to my companion, &quot;and if you reach the pump roomturn loose all the pumps.  It is the only chance Barsoom has to existtomorrow!&quot;From where I lay I opened the second door, and then the third, and as Isaw the hope of Barsoom crawling weakly on hands and knees through thelast doorway I sank unconscious upon the ground.CHAPTER XXVIIIAT THE ARIZONA CAVEIt was dark when I opened my eyes again.  Strange, stiff garments wereupon my body; garments that cracked and powdered away from me as I roseto a sitting posture.I felt myself over from head to foot and from head to foot I wasclothed, though when I fell unconscious at the little doorway I hadbeen naked.  Before me was a small patch of moonlit sky which showedthrough a ragged aperture.As my hands passed over my body they came in contact with pockets andin one of these a small parcel of matches wrapped in oiled paper.  Oneof these matches I struck, and its dim flame lighted up what appearedto be a huge cave, toward the back of which I discovered a strange,still figure huddled over a tiny bench.  As I approached it I saw thatit was the dead and mummified remains of a little old woman with longblack hair, and the thing it leaned over was a small charcoal burnerupon which rested a round copper vessel containing a small quantity ofgreenish powder.Behind her, depending from the roof upon rawhide thongs, and stretchingentirely across the cave, was a row of human skeletons.  From the thongwhich held them stretched another to the dead hand of the little oldwoman; as I touched the cord the skeletons swung to the motion with anoise as of the rustling of dry leaves.It was a most grotesque and horrid tableau and I hastened out into thefresh air; glad to escape from so gruesome a place.The sight that met my eyes as I stepped out upon a small ledge whichran before the entrance of the cave filled me with consternation.A new heaven and a new landscape met my gaze.  The silvered mountainsin the distance, the almost stationary moon hanging in the sky, thecacti-studded valley below me were not of Mars.  I could scarcebelieve my eyes, but the truth slowly forced itself upon me--I waslooking upon Arizona from the same ledge from which ten years before Ihad gazed with longing upon Mars.Burying my head in my arms I turned, broken, and sorrowful, down thetrail from the cave.Above me shone the red eye of Mars holding her awful secret,forty-eight million miles away.Did the Martian reach the pump room?  Did the vitalizing air reach thepeople of that distant planet in time to save them?  Was my DejahThoris alive, or did her beautiful body lie cold in death beside thetiny golden incubator in the sunken garden of the inner courtyard ofthe palace of Tardos Mors, the jeddak of Helium?For ten years I have waited and prayed for an answer to my questions.For ten years I have waited and prayed to be taken back to the world ofmy lost love.  I would rather lie dead beside her there than live onEarth all those millions of terrible miles from her.The old mine, which I found untouched, has made me fabulously wealthy;but what care I for wealth!As I sit here tonight in my little study overlooking the Hudson, justtwenty years have elapsed since I first opened my eyes upon Mars.I can see her shining in the sky through the little window by my desk,and tonight she seems calling to me again as she has not called beforesince that long dead night, and I think I can see, across that awfulabyss of space, a beautiful black-haired woman standing in the gardenof a palace, and at her side is a little boy who puts his arm aroundher as she points into the sky toward the planet Earth, while at theirfeet is a huge and hideous creature with a heart of gold.I believe that they are waiting there for me, and something tells methat I shall soon know.End of Project Gutenberg's A Princess of Mars, by Edgar Rice Burroughs*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A PRINCESS OF MARS ******** This file should be named 62.txt or 62.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.org/6/62/Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Auguste Dupin, in his little back library, orbook-closet, au troisiÃªme, No. 33, Rue DunÃ´t, Faubourg St. Germain. Forone hour at least we had maintained a profound silence; while each, toany casual observer, might have seemed intently and exclusively occupiedwith the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of thechamber. For myself, however, I was mentally discussing certain topicswhich had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier periodof the evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue, and the mysteryattending the murder of Marie RogÃªt. I looked upon it, therefore, assomething of a coincidence, when the door of our apartment was thrownopen and admitted our old acquaintance, Monsieur G--, the Prefect of theParisian police.We gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much of theentertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we had not seenhim for several years. We had been sitting in the dark, and Dupin nowarose for the purpose of lighting a lamp, but sat down again, withoutdoing so, upon G.'s saying that he had called to consult us, or ratherto ask the opinion of my friend, about some official business which hadoccasioned a great deal of trouble.&quot;If it is any point requiring reflection,&quot; observed Dupin, as heforebore to enkindle the wick, &quot;we shall examine it to better purpose inthe dark.&quot;&quot;That is another of your odd notions,&quot; said the Prefect, who had afashion of calling every thing &quot;odd&quot; that was beyond his comprehension,and thus lived amid an absolute legion of &quot;oddities.&quot;&quot;Very true,&quot; said Dupin, as he supplied his visiter with a pipe, androlled towards him a comfortable chair.&quot;And what is the difficulty now?&quot; I asked. &quot;Nothing more in theassassination way, I hope?&quot;&quot;Oh no; nothing of that nature. The fact is, the business is very simpleindeed, and I make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently wellourselves; but then I thought Dupin would like to hear the details ofit, because it is so excessively odd.&quot;&quot;Simple and odd,&quot; said Dupin.&quot;Why, yes; and not exactly that, either. The fact is, we have all beena good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple, and yet baffles usaltogether.&quot;&quot;Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you atfault,&quot; said my friend.&quot;What nonsense you do talk!&quot; replied the Prefect, laughing heartily.&quot;Perhaps the mystery is a little too plain,&quot; said Dupin.&quot;Oh, good heavens! who ever heard of such an idea?&quot;&quot;A little too self-evident.&quot;&quot;Ha! ha! ha--ha! ha! ha!--ho! ho! ho!&quot; roared our visiter, profoundlyamused, &quot;oh, Dupin, you will be the death of me yet!&quot;&quot;And what, after all, is the matter on hand?&quot; I asked.&quot;Why, I will tell you,&quot; replied the Prefect, as he gave a long, steadyand contemplative puff, and settled himself in his chair. &quot;I will tellyou in a few words; but, before I begin, let me caution you that thisis an affair demanding the greatest secrecy, and that I should mostprobably lose the position I now hold, were it known that I confided itto any one.&quot;&quot;Proceed,&quot; said I.&quot;Or not,&quot; said Dupin.&quot;Well, then; I have received personal information, from a very highquarter, that a certain document of the last importance, has beenpurloined from the royal apartments. The individual who purloined it isknown; this beyond a doubt; he was seen to take it. It is known, also,that it still remains in his possession.&quot;&quot;How is this known?&quot; asked Dupin.&quot;It is clearly inferred,&quot; replied the Prefect, &quot;from the nature of thedocument, and from the non-appearance of certain results which would atonce arise from its passing out of the robber's possession; that is tosay, from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it.&quot;&quot;Be a little more explicit,&quot; I said.&quot;Well, I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holdera certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immenselyvaluable.&quot; The Prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy.&quot;Still I do not quite understand,&quot; said Dupin.&quot;No? Well; the disclosure of the document to a third person, who shallbe nameless, would bring in question the honor of a personage of mostexalted station; and this fact gives the holder of the document anascendancy over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are sojeopardized.&quot;&quot;But this ascendancy,&quot; I interposed, &quot;would depend upon the robber'sknowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber. Who would dare--&quot;&quot;The thief,&quot; said G., &quot;is the Minister D--, who dares all things, thoseunbecoming as well as those becoming a man. The method of the theft wasnot less ingenious than bold. The document in question--a letter, tobe frank--had been received by the personage robbed while alone in theroyal boudoir. During its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by theentrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was herwish to conceal it. After a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it ina drawer, she was forced to place it, open as it was, upon a table. Theaddress, however, was uppermost, and, the contents thus unexposed, theletter escaped notice. At this juncture enters the Minister D--. Hislynx eye immediately perceives the paper, recognises the handwritingof the address, observes the confusion of the personage addressed, andfathoms her secret. After some business transactions, hurried through inhis ordinary manner, he produces a letter somewhat similar to the onein question, opens it, pretends to read it, and then places it inclose juxtaposition to the other. Again he converses, for some fifteenminutes, upon the public affairs. At length, in taking leave, he takesalso from the table the letter to which he had no claim. Its rightfulowner saw, but, of course, dared not call attention to the act, in thepresence of the third personage who stood at her elbow. The ministerdecamped; leaving his own letter--one of no importance--upon the table.&quot;&quot;Here, then,&quot; said Dupin to me, &quot;you have precisely what you demandto make the ascendancy complete--the robber's knowledge of the loser'sknowledge of the robber.&quot;&quot;Yes,&quot; replied the Prefect; &quot;and the power thus attained has, for somemonths past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very dangerousextent. The personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced, every day, ofthe necessity of reclaiming her letter. But this, of course, cannot bedone openly. In fine, driven to despair, she has committed the matter tome.&quot;&quot;Than whom,&quot; said Dupin, amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke, &quot;no moresagacious agent could, I suppose, be desired, or even imagined.&quot;&quot;You flatter me,&quot; replied the Prefect; &quot;but it is possible that somesuch opinion may have been entertained.&quot;&quot;It is clear,&quot; said I, &quot;as you observe, that the letter is still inpossession of the minister; since it is this possession, and not anyemployment of the letter, which bestows the power. With the employmentthe power departs.&quot;&quot;True,&quot; said G.; &quot;and upon this conviction I proceeded. My first carewas to make thorough search of the minister's hotel; and here my chiefembarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge.Beyond all things, I have been warned of the danger which would resultfrom giving him reason to suspect our design.&quot;&quot;But,&quot; said I, &quot;you are quite au fait in these investigations. TheParisian police have done this thing often before.&quot;&quot;O yes; and for this reason I did not despair. The habits of theminister gave me, too, a great advantage. He is frequently absent fromhome all night. His servants are by no means numerous. They sleep at adistance from their master's apartment, and, being chiefly Neapolitans,are readily made drunk. I have keys, as you know, with which I canopen any chamber or cabinet in Paris. For three months a night hasnot passed, during the greater part of which I have not been engaged,personally, in ransacking the D-- Hotel. My honor is interested, and, tomention a great secret, the reward is enormous. So I did not abandonthe search until I had become fully satisfied that the thief is a moreastute man than myself. I fancy that I have investigated every nook andcorner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can beconcealed.&quot;&quot;But is it not possible,&quot; I suggested, &quot;that although the letter maybe in possession of the minister, as it unquestionably is, he may haveconcealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises?&quot;&quot;This is barely possible,&quot; said Dupin. &quot;The present peculiar conditionof affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues in which D--is known to be involved, would render the instant availability of thedocument--its susceptibility of being produced at a moment's notice--apoint of nearly equal importance with its possession.&quot;&quot;Its susceptibility of being produced?&quot; said I.&quot;That is to say, of being destroyed,&quot; said Dupin.&quot;True,&quot; I observed; &quot;the paper is clearly then upon the premises. As forits being upon the person of the minister, we may consider that as outof the question.&quot;&quot;Entirely,&quot; said the Prefect. &quot;He has been twice waylaid, as if byfootpads, and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection.&quot;&quot;You might have spared yourself this trouble,&quot; said Dupin. &quot;D--, Ipresume, is not altogether a fool, and, if not, must have anticipatedthese waylayings, as a matter of course.&quot;&quot;Not altogether a fool,&quot; said G., &quot;but then he's a poet, which I take tobe only one remove from a fool.&quot;&quot;True,&quot; said Dupin, after a long and thoughtful whiff fromhis meerschaum, &quot;although I have been guilty of certain doggrel myself.&quot;&quot;Suppose you detail,&quot; said I, &quot;the particulars of your search.&quot;&quot;Why the fact is, we took our time, and we searched every where. I havehad long experience in these affairs. I took the entire building, roomby room; devoting the nights of a whole week to each. We examined,first, the furniture of each apartment. We opened every possible drawer;and I presume you know that, to a properly trained police agent, such athing as a secret drawer is impossible. Any man is a dolt who permits a'secret' drawer to escape him in a search of this kind. The thing is soplain. There is a certain amount of bulk--of space--to be accounted forin every cabinet. Then we have accurate rules. The fiftieth part of aline could not escape us. After the cabinets we took the chairs. Thecushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ.From the tables we removed the tops.&quot;&quot;Why so?&quot;&quot;Sometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece offurniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article; thenthe leg is excavated, the article deposited within the cavity, and thetop replaced. The bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the sameway.&quot;&quot;But could not the cavity be detected by sounding?&quot; I asked.&quot;By no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient waddingof cotton be placed around it. Besides, in our case, we were obliged toproceed without noise.&quot;&quot;But you could not have removed--you could not have taken to pieces allarticles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make adeposit in the manner you mention. A letter may be compressed intoa thin spiral roll, not differing much in shape or bulk from a largeknitting-needle, and in this form it might be inserted into the rung ofa chair, for example. You did not take to pieces all the chairs?&quot;&quot;Certainly not; but we did better--we examined the rungs of everychair in the hotel, and, indeed the jointings of every description offurniture, by the aid of a most powerful microscope. Had there beenany traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect itinstantly. A single grain of gimlet-dust, for example, would have beenas obvious as an apple. Any disorder in the glueing--any unusual gapingin the joints--would have sufficed to insure detection.&quot;&quot;I presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the plates,and you probed the beds and the bed-clothes, as well as the curtains andcarpets.&quot;&quot;That of course; and when we had absolutely completed every particle ofthe furniture in this way, then we examined the house itself. We dividedits entire surface into compartments, which we numbered, so thatnone might be missed; then we scrutinized each individual square inchthroughout the premises, including the two houses immediately adjoining,with the microscope, as before.&quot;&quot;The two houses adjoining!&quot; I exclaimed; &quot;you must have had a great dealof trouble.&quot;&quot;We had; but the reward offered is prodigious!&quot;&quot;You include the grounds about the houses?&quot;&quot;All the grounds are paved with brick. They gave us comparativelylittle trouble. We examined the moss between the bricks, and found itundisturbed.&quot;&quot;You looked among D--'s papers, of course, and into the books of thelibrary?&quot;&quot;Certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only openedevery book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume, not contentingourselves with a mere shake, according to the fashion of some of ourpolice officers. We also measured the thickness of every book-cover,with the most accurate admeasurement, and applied to each the mostjealous scrutiny of the microscope. Had any of the bindings beenrecently meddled with, it would have been utterly impossible that thefact should have escaped observation. Some five or six volumes, justfrom the hands of the binder, we carefully probed, longitudinally, withthe needles.&quot;&quot;You explored the floors beneath the carpets?&quot;&quot;Beyond doubt. We removed every carpet, and examined the boards with themicroscope.&quot;&quot;And the paper on the walls?&quot;&quot;Yes.&quot;&quot;You looked into the cellars?&quot;&quot;We did.&quot;&quot;Then,&quot; I said, &quot;you have been making a miscalculation, and the letteris not upon the premises, as you suppose.&quot;&quot;I fear you are right there,&quot; said the Prefect. &quot;And now, Dupin, whatwould you advise me to do?&quot;&quot;To make a thorough re-search of the premises.&quot;&quot;That is absolutely needless,&quot; replied G--. &quot;I am not more sure that Ibreathe than I am that the letter is not at the Hotel.&quot;&quot;I have no better advice to give you,&quot; said Dupin. &quot;You have, of course,an accurate description of the letter?&quot;&quot;Oh yes!&quot;--And here the Prefect, producing a memorandum-book proceededto read aloud a minute account of the internal, and especially of theexternal appearance of the missing document. Soon after finishingthe perusal of this description, he took his departure, more entirelydepressed in spirits than I had ever known the good gentleman before. Inabout a month afterwards he paid us another visit, and found us occupiedvery nearly as before. He took a pipe and a chair and entered into someordinary conversation. At length I said,--&quot;Well, but G--, what of the purloined letter? I presume you have atlast made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching theMinister?&quot;&quot;Confound him, say I--yes; I made the re-examination, however, as Dupinsuggested--but it was all labor lost, as I knew it would be.&quot;&quot;How much was the reward offered, did you say?&quot; asked Dupin.&quot;Why, a very great deal--a very liberal reward--I don't like to say howmuch, precisely; but one thing I will say, that I wouldn't mind givingmy individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who couldobtain me that letter. The fact is, it is becoming of more and moreimportance every day; and the reward has been lately doubled. If it weretrebled, however, I could do no more than I have done.&quot;&quot;Why, yes,&quot; said Dupin, drawlingly, between the whiffs of hismeerschaum, &quot;I really--think, G--, you have not exerted yourself--to theutmost in this matter. You might--do a little more, I think, eh?&quot;&quot;How?--in what way?'&quot;Why--puff, puff--you might--puff, puff--employ counsel in thematter, eh?--puff, puff, puff. Do you remember the story they tell ofAbernethy?&quot;&quot;No; hang Abernethy!&quot;&quot;To be sure! hang him and welcome. But, once upon a time, a certain richmiser conceived the design of spunging upon this Abernethy for a medicalopinion. Getting up, for this purpose, an ordinary conversation in aprivate company, he insinuated his case to the physician, as that of animaginary individual.&quot;'We will suppose,' said the miser, 'that his symptoms are such andsuch; now, doctor, what would you have directed him to take?'&quot;'Take!' said Abernethy, 'why, take advice, to be sure.'&quot;&quot;But,&quot; said the Prefect, a little discomposed, &quot;I am perfectly willingto take advice, and to pay for it. I would really give fifty thousandfrancs to any one who would aid me in the matter.&quot;&quot;In that case,&quot; replied Dupin, opening a drawer, and producinga check-book, &quot;you may as well fill me up a check for the amountmentioned. When you have signed it, I will hand you the letter.&quot;I was astounded. The Prefect appeared absolutely thunder-stricken.For some minutes he remained speechless and motionless, lookingincredulously at my friend with open mouth, and eyes that seemedstarting from their sockets; then, apparently recovering himself in somemeasure, he seized a pen, and after several pauses and vacant stares,finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs, andhanded it across the table to Dupin. The latter examined it carefullyand deposited it in his pocket-book; then, unlocking an escritoire, tookthence a letter and gave it to the Prefect. This functionary grasped itin a perfect agony of joy, opened it with a trembling hand, cast a rapidglance at its contents, and then, scrambling and struggling to thedoor, rushed at length unceremoniously from the room and from the house,without having uttered a syllable since Dupin had requested him to fillup the check.When he had gone, my friend entered into some explanations.&quot;The Parisian police,&quot; he said, &quot;are exceedingly able in their way.They are persevering, ingenious, cunning, and thoroughly versed in theknowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand. Thus, when G--detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the Hotel D--,I felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactoryinvestigation--so far as his labors extended.&quot;&quot;So far as his labors extended?&quot; said I.&quot;Yes,&quot; said Dupin. &quot;The measures adopted were not only the best oftheir kind, but carried out to absolute perfection. Had the letter beendeposited within the range of their search, these fellows would, beyonda question, have found it.&quot;I merely laughed--but he seemed quite serious in all that he said.&quot;The measures, then,&quot; he continued, &quot;were good in their kind, and wellexecuted; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case, andto the man. A certain set of highly ingenious resources are, with thePrefect, a sort of Procrustean bed, to which he forcibly adapts hisdesigns. But he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow, forthe matter in hand; and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than he. Iknew one about eight years of age, whose success at guessing in the gameof 'even and odd' attracted universal admiration. This game is simple,and is played with marbles. One player holds in his hand a number ofthese toys, and demands of another whether that number is even or odd.If the guess is right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he loses one. Theboy to whom I allude won all the marbles of the school. Of course hehad some principle of guessing; and this lay in mere observation andadmeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents. For example, an arrantsimpleton is his opponent, and, holding up his closed hand, asks, 'arethey even or odd?' Our schoolboy replies, 'odd,' and loses; but upon thesecond trial he wins, for he then says to himself, 'the simpletonhad them even upon the first trial, and his amount of cunning is justsufficient to make him have them odd upon the second; I will thereforeguess odd;'--he guesses odd, and wins. Now, with a simpleton a degreeabove the first, he would have reasoned thus: 'This fellow finds that inthe first instance I guessed odd, and, in the second, he will propose tohimself, upon the first impulse, a simple variation from even to odd,as did the first simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest thatthis is too simple a variation, and finally he will decide upon puttingit even as before. I will therefore guess even;'--he guesses even, andwins. Now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy, whom his fellowstermed 'lucky,'--what, in its last analysis, is it?&quot;&quot;It is merely,&quot; I said, &quot;an identification of the reasoner's intellectwith that of his opponent.&quot;&quot;It is,&quot; said Dupin; &quot;and, upon inquiring of the boy by what means heeffected the thorough identification in which his success consisted, Ireceived answer as follows: 'When I wish to find out how wise, or howstupid, or how good, or how wicked is any one, or what are his thoughtsat the moment, I fashion the expression of my face, as accurately aspossible, in accordance with the expression of his, and then wait to seewhat thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to match orcorrespond with the expression.' This response of the schoolboy lies atthe bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed toRochefoucault, to La Bougive, to Machiavelli, and to Campanella.&quot;&quot;And the identification,&quot; I said, &quot;of the reasoner's intellect with thatof his opponent, depends, if I understand you aright, upon the accuracywith which the opponent's intellect is admeasured.&quot;&quot;For its practical value it depends upon this,&quot; replied Dupin; &quot;and thePrefect and his cohort fail so frequently, first, by default of thisidentification, and, secondly, by ill-admeasurement, or rather throughnon-admeasurement, of the intellect with which they are engaged. Theyconsider only their own ideas of ingenuity; and, in searching foranything hidden, advert only to the modes in which they would havehidden it. They are right in this much--that their own ingenuity is afaithful representative of that of the mass; but when the cunning of theindividual felon is diverse in character from their own, the felon foilsthem, of course. This always happens when it is above their own, andvery usually when it is below. They have no variation of principle intheir investigations; at best, when urged by some unusual emergency--bysome extraordinary reward--they extend or exaggerate their old modes ofpractice, without touching their principles. What, for example, in thiscase of D--, has been done to vary the principle of action? What isall this boring, and probing, and sounding, and scrutinizing with themicroscope and dividing the surface of the building into registeredsquare inches--what is it all but an exaggeration of the application ofthe one principle or set of principles of search, which are based uponthe one set of notions regarding human ingenuity, to which the Prefect,in the long routine of his duty, has been accustomed? Do you not see hehas taken it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter,--notexactly in a gimlet hole bored in a chair-leg--but, at least, in someout-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thoughtwhich would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole bored ina chair-leg? And do you not see also, that such recherchÃ©s nooks forconcealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions, and would beadopted only by ordinary intellects; for, in all cases of concealment,a disposal of the article concealed--a disposal of it in this recherchÃ©manner,--is, in the very first instance, presumable and presumed; andthus its discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but altogetherupon the mere care, patience, and determination of the seekers; andwhere the case is of importance--or, what amounts to the same thing inthe policial eyes, when the reward is of magnitude,--the qualities inquestion have never been known to fail. You will now understand what Imeant in suggesting that, had the purloined letter been hidden any wherewithin the limits of the Prefect's examination--in other words, had theprinciple of its concealment been comprehended within the principles ofthe Prefect--its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyondquestion. This functionary, however, has been thoroughly mystified;and the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that theMinister is a fool, because he has acquired renown as a poet. All foolsare poets; this the Prefect feels; and he is merely guilty of a nondistributio medii in thence inferring that all poets are fools.&quot;&quot;But is this really the poet?&quot; I asked. &quot;There are two brothers, I know;and both have attained reputation in letters. The Minister I believe haswritten learnedly on the Differential Calculus. He is a mathematician,and no poet.&quot;&quot;You are mistaken; I know him well; he is both. As poet andmathematician, he would reason well; as mere mathematician, he couldnot have reasoned at all, and thus would have been at the mercy of thePrefect.&quot;&quot;You surprise me,&quot; I said, &quot;by these opinions, which have beencontradicted by the voice of the world. You do not mean to set at naughtthe well-digested idea of centuries. The mathematical reason has longbeen regarded as the reason par excellence.&quot;&quot;'Il y a Ã  pariÃ¨r,'&quot; replied Dupin, quoting from Chamfort, &quot;'que touteidÃ©e publique, toute convention reÃ§ue est une sottise, car elle aconvenue au plus grand nombre.' The mathematicians, I grant you, havedone their best to promulgate the popular error to which you allude, andwhich is none the less an error for its promulgation as truth. With anart worthy a better cause, for example, they have insinuated the term'analysis' into application to algebra. The French are the originatorsof this particular deception; but if a term is of any importance--ifwords derive any value from applicability--then 'analysis' conveys'algebra' about as much as, in Latin, 'ambitus' implies 'ambition,''religio' 'religion,' or 'homines honesti,' a set of honorablemen.&quot;&quot;You have a quarrel on hand, I see,&quot; said I, &quot;with some of thealgebraists of Paris; but proceed.&quot;&quot;I dispute the availability, and thus the value, of that reason whichis cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly logical.I dispute, in particular, the reason educed by mathematical study. Themathematics are the science of form and quantity; mathematical reasoningis merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity. The greaterror lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called purealgebra, are abstract or general truths. And this error is so egregiousthat I am confounded at the universality with which it has beenreceived. Mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth. What istrue of relation--of form and quantity--is often grossly false in regardto morals, for example. In this latter science it is very usually untruethat the aggregated parts are equal to the whole. In chemistry also theaxiom fails. In the consideration of motive it fails; for two motives,each of a given value, have not, necessarily, a value when united, equalto the sum of their values apart. There are numerous other mathematicaltruths which are only truths within the limits of relation. But themathematician argues, from his finite truths, through habit, as ifthey were of an absolutely general applicability--as the world indeedimagines them to be. Bryant, in his very learned 'Mythology,' mentionsan analogous source of error, when he says that 'although the Paganfables are not believed, yet we forget ourselves continually, and makeinferences from them as existing realities.' With the algebraists,however, who are Pagans themselves, the 'Pagan fables' are believed, andthe inferences are made, not so much through lapse of memory, asthrough an unaccountable addling of the brains. In short, I never yetencountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equalroots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faiththat x2+px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q. Say to one ofthese gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please, that you believeoccasions may occur where x2+px is not altogether equal to q, and,having made him understand what you mean, get out of his reach asspeedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock youdown.&quot;I mean to say,&quot; continued Dupin, while I merely laughed at hislast observations, &quot;that if the Minister had been no more than amathematician, the Prefect would have been under no necessity of givingme this check. I know him, however, as both mathematician and poet,and my measures were adapted to his capacity, with reference to thecircumstances by which he was surrounded. I knew him as a courtier, too,and as a bold intriguant. Such a man, I considered, could not fail to beaware of the ordinary policial modes of action. He could not havefailed to anticipate--and events have proved that he did not fail toanticipate--the waylayings to which he was subjected. He must haveforeseen, I reflected, the secret investigations of his premises. Hisfrequent absences from home at night, which were hailed by the Prefectas certain aids to his success, I regarded only as ruses, to affordopportunity for thorough search to the police, and thus the sooner toimpress them with the conviction to which G--, in fact, did finallyarrive--the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises. Ifelt, also, that the whole train of thought, which I was at some painsin detailing to you just now, concerning the invariable principle ofpolicial action in searches for articles concealed--I felt that thiswhole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of theMinister. It would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinarynooks of concealment. He could not, I reflected, be so weak as not tosee that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would beas open as his commonest closets to the eyes, to the probes, to thegimlets, and to the microscopes of the Prefect. I saw, in fine, thathe would be driven, as a matter of course, to simplicity, if notdeliberately induced to it as a matter of choice. You will remember,perhaps, how desperately the Prefect laughed when I suggested, upon ourfirst interview, that it was just possible this mystery troubled him somuch on account of its being so very self-evident.&quot;&quot;Yes,&quot; said I, &quot;I remember his merriment well. I really thought he wouldhave fallen into convulsions.&quot;&quot;The material world,&quot; continued Dupin, &quot;abounds with very strictanalogies to the immaterial; and thus some color of truth has beengiven to the rhetorical dogma, that metaphor, or simile, may be madeto strengthen an argument, as well as to embellish a description. Theprinciple of the vis inertiÃ¦, for example, seems to be identical inphysics and metaphysics. It is not more true in the former, that a largebody is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one, and thatits subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty, than itis, in the latter, that intellects of the vaster capacity, while moreforcible, more constant, and more eventful in their movements than thoseof inferior grade, are yet the less readily moved, and more embarrassedand full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress. Again:have you ever noticed which of the street signs, over the shop-doors,are the most attractive of attention?&quot;&quot;I have never given the matter a thought,&quot; I said.&quot;There is a game of puzzles,&quot; he resumed, &quot;which is played upon a map.One party playing requires another to find a given word--the name oftown, river, state or empire--any word, in short, upon the motley andperplexed surface of the chart. A novice in the game generally seeks toembarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names;but the adept selects such words as stretch, in large characters, fromone end of the chart to the other. These, like the over-largely letteredsigns and placards of the street, escape observation by dint of beingexcessively obvious; and here the physical oversight is preciselyanalogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffersto pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and toopalpably self-evident. But this is a point, it appears, somewhat aboveor beneath the understanding of the Prefect. He never once thoughtit probable, or possible, that the Minister had deposited the letterimmediately beneath the nose of the whole world, by way of bestpreventing any portion of that world from perceiving it.&quot;But the more I reflected upon the daring, dashing, and discriminatingingenuity of D--; upon the fact that the document must always have beenat hand, if he intended to use it to good purpose; and upon the decisiveevidence, obtained by the Prefect, that it was not hidden within thelimits of that dignitary's ordinary search--the more satisfied Ibecame that, to conceal this letter, the Minister had resorted to thecomprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it atall.&quot;Full of these ideas, I prepared myself with a pair of green spectacles,and called one fine morning, quite by accident, at the Ministerialhotel. I found D-- at home, yawning, lounging, and dawdling, as usual,and pretending to be in the last extremity of ennui. He is, perhaps,the most really energetic human being now alive--but that is only whennobody sees him.&quot;To be even with him, I complained of my weak eyes, and lamented thenecessity of the spectacles, under cover of which I cautiously andthoroughly surveyed the whole apartment, while seemingly intent onlyupon the conversation of my host.&quot;I paid especial attention to a large writing-table near which he sat,and upon which lay confusedly, some miscellaneous letters and otherpapers, with one or two musical instruments and a few books. Here,however, after a long and very deliberate scrutiny, I saw nothing toexcite particular suspicion.&quot;At length my eyes, in going the circuit of the room, fell upon atrumpery fillagree card-rack of pasteboard, that hung dangling by adirty blue ribbon, from a little brass knob just beneath the middle ofthe mantel-piece. In this rack, which had three or four compartments,were five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter. This lastwas much soiled and crumpled. It was torn nearly in two, across themiddle--as if a design, in the first instance, to tear it entirely upas worthless, had been altered, or stayed, in the second. It had alarge black seal, bearing the D-- cipher very conspicuously, and wasaddressed, in a diminutive female hand, to D--, the minister, himself.It was thrust carelessly, and even, as it seemed, contemptuously, intoone of the uppermost divisions of the rack.&quot;No sooner had I glanced at this letter, than I concluded it to bethat of which I was in search. To be sure, it was, to all appearance,radically different from the one of which the Prefect had read us sominute a description. Here the seal was large and black, with the D--cipher; there it was small and red, with the ducal arms of the S--family. Here, the address, to the Minister, diminutive and feminine;there the superscription, to a certain royal personage, was markedlybold and decided; the size alone formed a point of correspondence. But,then, the radicalness of these differences, which was excessive; thedirt; the soiled and torn condition of the paper, so inconsistent withthe true methodical habits of D--, and so suggestive of a design todelude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the document;these things, together with the hyper-obtrusive situation of thisdocument, full in the view of every visiter, and thus exactly inaccordance with the conclusions to which I had previously arrived; thesethings, I say, were strongly corroborative of suspicion, in one who camewith the intention to suspect.&quot;I protracted my visit as long as possible, and, while I maintained amost animated discussion with the Minister upon a topic which I knewwell had never failed to interest and excite him, I kept my attentionreally riveted upon the letter. In this examination, I committed tomemory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack; and alsofell, at length, upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivialdoubt I might have entertained. In scrutinizing the edges of the paper,I observed them to be more chafed than seemed necessary. They presentedthe broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper, havingbeen once folded and pressed with a folder, is refolded in a reverseddirection, in the same creases or edges which had formed the originalfold. This discovery was sufficient. It was clear to me that the letterhad been turned, as a glove, inside out, re-directed, and re-sealed. Ibade the Minister good morning, and took my departure at once, leaving agold snuff-box upon the table.&quot;The next morning I called for the snuff-box, when we resumed, quiteeagerly, the conversation of the preceding day. While thus engaged,however, a loud report, as if of a pistol, was heard immediately beneaththe windows of the hotel, and was succeeded by a series of fearfulscreams, and the shoutings of a terrified mob. D-- rushed to a casement,threw it open, and looked out. In the meantime, I stepped to thecard-rack, took the letter, put it in my pocket, and replaced it bya fac-simile, (so far as regards externals,) which I had carefullyprepared at my lodgings--imitating the D-- cipher, very readily, bymeans of a seal formed of bread.&quot;The disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the franticbehavior of a man with a musket. He had fired it among a crowd of womenand children. It proved, however, to have been without ball, and thefellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard. Whenhe had gone, D-- came from the window, whither I had followed himimmediately upon securing the object in view. Soon afterwards I bade himfarewell. The pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay.&quot;&quot;But what purpose had you,&quot; I asked, &quot;in replacing the letter by afac-simile? Would it not have been better, at the first visit, to haveseized it openly, and departed?&quot;&quot;D--,&quot; replied Dupin, &quot;is a desperate man, and a man of nerve. Hishotel, too, is not without attendants devoted to his interests. HadI made the wild attempt you suggest, I might never have left theMinisterial presence alive. The good people of Paris might have heardof me no more. But I had an object apart from these considerations. Youknow my political prepossessions. In this matter, I act as a partisan ofthe lady concerned. For eighteen months the Minister has had her in hispower. She has now him in hers--since, being unaware that the letter isnot in his possession, he will proceed with his exactions as if itwas. Thus will he inevitably commit himself, at once, to his politicaldestruction. His downfall, too, will not be more precipitate thanawkward. It is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus Averni;but in all kinds of climbing, as Catalani said of singing, it is farmore easy to get up than to come down. In the present instance I haveno sympathy--at least no pity--for him who descends. He is that monstrumhorrendum, an unprincipled man of genius. I confess, however, that Ishould like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts,when, being defied by her whom the Prefect terms 'a certain personage'he is reduced to opening the letter which I left for him in thecard-rack.&quot;&quot;How? did you put any thing particular in it?&quot;&quot;Why--it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blank--thatwould have been insulting. D--, at Vienna once, did me an evil turn,which I told him, quite good-humoredly, that I should remember. So, asI knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of theperson who had outwitted him, I thought it a pity not to give him aclue. He is well acquainted with my MS., and I just copied into themiddle of the blank sheet the words--&quot;'-- -- Un dessein si funeste, S'il n'est digne d'AtrÃ©e, est digne deThyeste. They are to be found in Crebillon's 'AtrÃ©e.'&quot;THE THOUSAND-AND-SECOND TALE OF SCHEHERAZADE                     Truth is stranger than fiction.                              OLD SAYING.HAVING had occasion, lately, in the course of some Orientalinvestigations, to consult the Tellmenow Isitsoornot, a work which (likethe Zohar of Simeon Jochaides) is scarcely known at all, even in Europe;and which has never been quoted, to my knowledge, by any American--ifwe except, perhaps, the author of the &quot;Curiosities of AmericanLiterature&quot;;--having had occasion, I say, to turn over some pages of thefirst-mentioned very remarkable work, I was not a little astonished todiscover that the literary world has hitherto been strangely in errorrespecting the fate of the vizier's daughter, Scheherazade, as thatfate is depicted in the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;; and that the denouement theregiven, if not altogether inaccurate, as far as it goes, is at least toblame in not having gone very much farther.For full information on this interesting topic, I must refer theinquisitive reader to the &quot;Isitsoornot&quot; itself, but in the meantime, Ishall be pardoned for giving a summary of what I there discovered.It will be remembered, that, in the usual version of the tales, acertain monarch having good cause to be jealous of his queen, not onlyputs her to death, but makes a vow, by his beard and the prophet, toespouse each night the most beautiful maiden in his dominions, and thenext morning to deliver her up to the executioner.Having fulfilled this vow for many years to the letter, and with areligious punctuality and method that conferred great credit upon himas a man of devout feeling and excellent sense, he was interrupted oneafternoon (no doubt at his prayers) by a visit from his grand vizier, towhose daughter, it appears, there had occurred an idea.Her name was Scheherazade, and her idea was, that she would eitherredeem the land from the depopulating tax upon its beauty, or perish,after the approved fashion of all heroines, in the attempt.Accordingly, and although we do not find it to be leap-year (whichmakes the sacrifice more meritorious), she deputes her father, the grandvizier, to make an offer to the king of her hand. This hand the kingeagerly accepts--(he had intended to take it at all events, and had putoff the matter from day to day, only through fear of the vizier),--but,in accepting it now, he gives all parties very distinctly to understand,that, grand vizier or no grand vizier, he has not the slightest designof giving up one iota of his vow or of his privileges. When, therefore,the fair Scheherazade insisted upon marrying the king, and did actuallymarry him despite her father's excellent advice not to do any thing ofthe kind--when she would and did marry him, I say, will I, nill I, itwas with her beautiful black eyes as thoroughly open as the nature ofthe case would allow.It seems, however, that this politic damsel (who had been readingMachiavelli, beyond doubt), had a very ingenious little plot in hermind. On the night of the wedding, she contrived, upon I forget whatspecious pretence, to have her sister occupy a couch sufficiently nearthat of the royal pair to admit of easy conversation from bed to bed;and, a little before cock-crowing, she took care to awaken the goodmonarch, her husband (who bore her none the worse will because heintended to wring her neck on the morrow),--she managed to awaken him, Isay, (although on account of a capital conscience and an easy digestion,he slept well) by the profound interest of a story (about a rat and ablack cat, I think) which she was narrating (all in an undertone, ofcourse) to her sister. When the day broke, it so happened that thishistory was not altogether finished, and that Scheherazade, in thenature of things could not finish it just then, since it was high timefor her to get up and be bowstrung--a thing very little more pleasantthan hanging, only a trifle more genteel.The king's curiosity, however, prevailing, I am sorry to say, even overhis sound religious principles, induced him for this once to postponethe fulfilment of his vow until next morning, for the purpose and withthe hope of hearing that night how it fared in the end with the blackcat (a black cat, I think it was) and the rat.The night having arrived, however, the lady Scheherazade not only putthe finishing stroke to the black cat and the rat (the rat was blue)but before she well knew what she was about, found herself deep in theintricacies of a narration, having reference (if I am not altogethermistaken) to a pink horse (with green wings) that went, in a violentmanner, by clockwork, and was wound up with an indigo key. With thishistory the king was even more profoundly interested than with theother--and, as the day broke before its conclusion (notwithstandingall the queen's endeavors to get through with it in time for thebowstringing), there was again no resource but to postpone that ceremonyas before, for twenty-four hours. The next night there happened asimilar accident with a similar result; and then the next--and thenagain the next; so that, in the end, the good monarch, having beenunavoidably deprived of all opportunity to keep his vow during aperiod of no less than one thousand and one nights, either forgets italtogether by the expiration of this time, or gets himself absolved ofit in the regular way, or (what is more probable) breaks it outright, aswell as the head of his father confessor. At all events, Scheherazade,who, being lineally descended from Eve, fell heir, perhaps, to the wholeseven baskets of talk, which the latter lady, we all know, picked upfrom under the trees in the garden of Eden--Scheherazade, I say, finallytriumphed, and the tariff upon beauty was repealed.Now, this conclusion (which is that of the story as we have it uponrecord) is, no doubt, excessively proper and pleasant--but alas! likea great many pleasant things, is more pleasant than true, and I amindebted altogether to the &quot;Isitsoornot&quot; for the means of correcting theerror. &quot;Le mieux,&quot; says a French proverb, &quot;est l'ennemi du bien,&quot; and,in mentioning that Scheherazade had inherited the seven baskets of talk,I should have added that she put them out at compound interest untilthey amounted to seventy-seven.&quot;My dear sister,&quot; said she, on the thousand-and-second night, (I quotethe language of the &quot;Isitsoornot&quot; at this point, verbatim) &quot;my dearsister,&quot; said she, &quot;now that all this little difficulty about thebowstring has blown over, and that this odious tax is so happilyrepealed, I feel that I have been guilty of great indiscretion inwithholding from you and the king (who I am sorry to say, snores--athing no gentleman would do) the full conclusion of Sinbad the sailor.This person went through numerous other and more interesting adventuresthan those which I related; but the truth is, I felt sleepy on theparticular night of their narration, and so was seduced into cuttingthem short--a grievous piece of misconduct, for which I only trust thatAllah will forgive me. But even yet it is not too late to remedy mygreat neglect--and as soon as I have given the king a pinch or two inorder to wake him up so far that he may stop making that horrible noise,I will forthwith entertain you (and him if he pleases) with the sequelof this very remarkable story.&quot;Hereupon the sister of Scheherazade, as I have it from the&quot;Isitsoornot,&quot; expressed no very particular intensity of gratification;but the king, having been sufficiently pinched, at length ceasedsnoring, and finally said, &quot;hum!&quot; and then &quot;hoo!&quot; when the queen,understanding these words (which are no doubt Arabic) to signify thathe was all attention, and would do his best not to snore any more--thequeen, I say, having arranged these matters to her satisfaction,re-entered thus, at once, into the history of Sinbad the sailor:&quot;'At length, in my old age,' [these are the words of Sinbad himself, asretailed by Scheherazade]--'at length, in my old age, and after enjoyingmany years of tranquillity at home, I became once more possessed of adesire of visiting foreign countries; and one day, without acquaintingany of my family with my design, I packed up some bundles of suchmerchandise as was most precious and least bulky, and, engaged a porterto carry them, went with him down to the sea-shore, to await the arrivalof any chance vessel that might convey me out of the kingdom into someregion which I had not as yet explored.&quot;'Having deposited the packages upon the sands, we sat down beneath sometrees, and looked out into the ocean in the hope of perceiving a ship,but during several hours we saw none whatever. At length I fancied thatI could hear a singular buzzing or humming sound; and the porter, afterlistening awhile, declared that he also could distinguish it. Presentlyit grew louder, and then still louder, so that we could have no doubtthat the object which caused it was approaching us. At length, onthe edge of the horizon, we discovered a black speck, which rapidlyincreased in size until we made it out to be a vast monster, swimmingwith a great part of its body above the surface of the sea. It cametoward us with inconceivable swiftness, throwing up huge waves of foamaround its breast, and illuminating all that part of the sea throughwhich it passed, with a long line of fire that extended far off into thedistance.&quot;'As the thing drew near we saw it very distinctly. Its length was equalto that of three of the loftiest trees that grow, and it was as wide asthe great hall of audience in your palace, O most sublime and munificentof the Caliphs. Its body, which was unlike that of ordinary fishes, wasas solid as a rock, and of a jetty blackness throughout all that portionof it which floated above the water, with the exception of a narrowblood-red streak that completely begirdled it. The belly, which floatedbeneath the surface, and of which we could get only a glimpse now andthen as the monster rose and fell with the billows, was entirely coveredwith metallic scales, of a color like that of the moon in misty weather.The back was flat and nearly white, and from it there extended upwardsof six spines, about half the length of the whole body.&quot;'The horrible creature had no mouth that we could perceive, but, as ifto make up for this deficiency, it was provided with at least fourscore of eyes, that protruded from their sockets like those of the greendragon-fly, and were arranged all around the body in two rows, one abovethe other, and parallel to the blood-red streak, which seemed to answerthe purpose of an eyebrow. Two or three of these dreadful eyes were muchlarger than the others, and had the appearance of solid gold.&quot;'Although this beast approached us, as I have before said, with thegreatest rapidity, it must have been moved altogether by necromancy--forit had neither fins like a fish nor web-feet like a duck, nor wings likethe seashell which is blown along in the manner of a vessel; nor yetdid it writhe itself forward as do the eels. Its head and its tail wereshaped precisely alike, only, not far from the latter, were two smallholes that served for nostrils, and through which the monster puffedout its thick breath with prodigious violence, and with a shrieking,disagreeable noise.&quot;'Our terror at beholding this hideous thing was very great, but it waseven surpassed by our astonishment, when upon getting a nearer look, weperceived upon the creature's back a vast number of animals about thesize and shape of men, and altogether much resembling them, except thatthey wore no garments (as men do), being supplied (by nature, no doubt)with an ugly uncomfortable covering, a good deal like cloth, but fittingso tight to the skin, as to render the poor wretches laughably awkward,and put them apparently to severe pain. On the very tips of their headswere certain square-looking boxes, which, at first sight, I thoughtmight have been intended to answer as turbans, but I soon discoveredthat they were excessively heavy and solid, and I therefore concludedthey were contrivances designed, by their great weight, to keep theheads of the animals steady and safe upon their shoulders. Aroundthe necks of the creatures were fastened black collars, (badges ofservitude, no doubt,) such as we keep on our dogs, only much widerand infinitely stiffer, so that it was quite impossible for these poorvictims to move their heads in any direction without moving the body atthe same time; and thus they were doomed to perpetual contemplation oftheir noses--a view puggish and snubby in a wonderful, if not positivelyin an awful degree.&quot;'When the monster had nearly reached the shore where we stood, itsuddenly pushed out one of its eyes to a great extent, and emitted fromit a terrible flash of fire, accompanied by a dense cloud of smoke, anda noise that I can compare to nothing but thunder. As the smoke clearedaway, we saw one of the odd man-animals standing near the head of thelarge beast with a trumpet in his hand, through which (putting it tohis mouth) he presently addressed us in loud, harsh, and disagreeableaccents, that, perhaps, we should have mistaken for language, had theynot come altogether through the nose.&quot;'Being thus evidently spoken to, I was at a loss how to reply, as Icould in no manner understand what was said; and in this difficultyI turned to the porter, who was near swooning through affright, anddemanded of him his opinion as to what species of monster it was, whatit wanted, and what kind of creatures those were that so swarmedupon its back. To this the porter replied, as well as he could fortrepidation, that he had once before heard of this sea-beast; that itwas a cruel demon, with bowels of sulphur and blood of fire, createdby evil genii as the means of inflicting misery upon mankind; that thethings upon its back were vermin, such as sometimes infest cats anddogs, only a little larger and more savage; and that these vermin hadtheir uses, however evil--for, through the torture they caused the beastby their nibbling and stingings, it was goaded into that degree of wrathwhich was requisite to make it roar and commit ill, and so fulfil thevengeful and malicious designs of the wicked genii.&quot;This account determined me to take to my heels, and, without once evenlooking behind me, I ran at full speed up into the hills, while theporter ran equally fast, although nearly in an opposite direction, sothat, by these means, he finally made his escape with my bundles, ofwhich I have no doubt he took excellent care--although this is a point Icannot determine, as I do not remember that I ever beheld him again.&quot;'For myself, I was so hotly pursued by a swarm of the men-vermin (whohad come to the shore in boats) that I was very soon overtaken, boundhand and foot, and conveyed to the beast, which immediately swam outagain into the middle of the sea.&quot;'I now bitterly repented my folly in quitting a comfortable home toperil my life in such adventures as this; but regret being useless, Imade the best of my condition, and exerted myself to secure the goodwillof the man-animal that owned the trumpet, and who appeared to exerciseauthority over his fellows. I succeeded so well in this endeavor that,in a few days, the creature bestowed upon me various tokens of hisfavor, and in the end even went to the trouble of teaching me therudiments of what it was vain enough to denominate its language; sothat, at length, I was enabled to converse with it readily, and came tomake it comprehend the ardent desire I had of seeing the world.&quot;'Washish squashish squeak, Sinbad, hey-diddle diddle, grunt untgrumble, hiss, fiss, whiss,' said he to me, one day after dinner--butI beg a thousand pardons, I had forgotten that your majesty is notconversant with the dialect of the Cock-neighs (so the man-animals werecalled; I presume because their language formed the connectinglink between that of the horse and that of the rooster). With yourpermission, I will translate. 'Washish squashish,' and so forth:--thatis to say, 'I am happy to find, my dear Sinbad, that you are really avery excellent fellow; we are now about doing a thing which is calledcircumnavigating the globe; and since you are so desirous of seeing theworld, I will strain a point and give you a free passage upon back ofthe beast.'&quot;When the Lady Scheherazade had proceeded thus far, relates the&quot;Isitsoornot,&quot; the king turned over from his left side to his right, andsaid:&quot;It is, in fact, very surprising, my dear queen, that you omitted,hitherto, these latter adventures of Sinbad. Do you know I think themexceedingly entertaining and strange?&quot;The king having thus expressed himself, we are told, the fairScheherazade resumed her history in the following words:&quot;Sinbad went on in this manner with his narrative to the caliph--'Ithanked the man-animal for its kindness, and soon found myself very muchat home on the beast, which swam at a prodigious rate through the ocean;although the surface of the latter is, in that part of the world, byno means flat, but round like a pomegranate, so that we went--so tosay--either up hill or down hill all the time.'&quot;That I think, was very singular,&quot; interrupted the king.&quot;Nevertheless, it is quite true,&quot; replied Scheherazade.&quot;I have my doubts,&quot; rejoined the king; &quot;but, pray, be so good as to goon with the story.&quot;&quot;I will,&quot; said the queen. &quot;'The beast,' continued Sinbad to the caliph,'swam, as I have related, up hill and down hill until, at length, wearrived at an island, many hundreds of miles in circumference, butwhich, nevertheless, had been built in the middle of the sea by a colonyof little things like caterpillars'&quot; (*1)&quot;Hum!&quot; said the king.&quot;'Leaving this island,' said Sinbad--(for Scheherazade, it must beunderstood, took no notice of her husband's ill-mannered ejaculation)'leaving this island, we came to another where the forests were of solidstone, and so hard that they shivered to pieces the finest-tempered axeswith which we endeavoured to cut them down.&quot;' (*2)&quot;Hum!&quot; said the king, again; but Scheherazade, paying him no attention,continued in the language of Sinbad.&quot;'Passing beyond this last island, we reached a country where therewas a cave that ran to the distance of thirty or forty miles within thebowels of the earth, and that contained a greater number of far morespacious and more magnificent palaces than are to be found in allDamascus and Bagdad. From the roofs of these palaces there hung myriadsof gems, like diamonds, but larger than men; and in among the streetsof towers and pyramids and temples, there flowed immense rivers as blackas ebony, and swarming with fish that had no eyes.'&quot; (*3)&quot;Hum!&quot; said the king. &quot;'We then swam into a region of the sea wherewe found a lofty mountain, down whose sides there streamed torrents ofmelted metal, some of which were twelve miles wide and sixty miles long(*4); while from an abyss on the summit, issued so vast a quantity ofashes that the sun was entirely blotted out from the heavens, and itbecame darker than the darkest midnight; so that when we were even atthe distance of a hundred and fifty miles from the mountain, it wasimpossible to see the whitest object, however close we held it to oureyes.'&quot; (*5)&quot;Hum!&quot; said the king.&quot;'After quitting this coast, the beast continued his voyage until we metwith a land in which the nature of things seemed reversed--for we heresaw a great lake, at the bottom of which, more than a hundred feetbeneath the surface of the water, there flourished in full leaf a forestof tall and luxuriant trees.'&quot; (*6)&quot;Hoo!&quot; said the king.&quot;Some hundred miles farther on brought us to a climate where theatmosphere was so dense as to sustain iron or steel, just as our owndoes feather.'&quot; (*7)&quot;Fiddle de dee,&quot; said the king.&quot;Proceeding still in the same direction, we presently arrived at themost magnificent region in the whole world. Through it there meandereda glorious river for several thousands of miles. This river was ofunspeakable depth, and of a transparency richer than that of amber.It was from three to six miles in width; and its banks which arose oneither side to twelve hundred feet in perpendicular height, were crownedwith ever-blossoming trees and perpetual sweet-scented flowers, thatmade the whole territory one gorgeous garden; but the name of thisluxuriant land was the Kingdom of Horror, and to enter it was inevitabledeath'&quot; (*8)&quot;Humph!&quot; said the king.&quot;'We left this kingdom in great haste, and, after some days, came toanother, where we were astonished to perceive myriads of monstrousanimals with horns resembling scythes upon their heads. These hideousbeasts dig for themselves vast caverns in the soil, of a funnel shape,and line the sides of them with rocks, so disposed one upon the otherthat they fall instantly, when trodden upon by other animals, thusprecipitating them into the monster's dens, where their blood isimmediately sucked, and their carcasses afterwards hurled contemptuouslyout to an immense distance from &quot;the caverns of death.&quot;'&quot; (*9)&quot;Pooh!&quot; said the king.&quot;'Continuing our progress, we perceived a district with vegetables thatgrew not upon any soil but in the air. (*10) There were others thatsprang from the substance of other vegetables; (*11) others that derivedtheir substance from the bodies of living animals; (*12) and then again,there were others that glowed all over with intense fire; (*13) othersthat moved from place to place at pleasure, (*14) and what was stillmore wonderful, we discovered flowers that lived and breathed and movedtheir limbs at will and had, moreover, the detestable passion of mankindfor enslaving other creatures, and confining them in horrid and solitaryprisons until the fulfillment of appointed tasks.'&quot; (*15)&quot;Pshaw!&quot; said the king.&quot;'Quitting this land, we soon arrived at another in which the bees andthe birds are mathematicians of such genius and erudition, that theygive daily instructions in the science of geometry to the wise menof the empire. The king of the place having offered a reward for thesolution of two very difficult problems, they were solved upon thespot--the one by the bees, and the other by the birds; but the kingkeeping their solution a secret, it was only after the most profoundresearches and labor, and the writing of an infinity of big books,during a long series of years, that the men-mathematicians at lengtharrived at the identical solutions which had been given upon the spot bythe bees and by the birds.'&quot; (*16)&quot;Oh my!&quot; said the king.&quot;'We had scarcely lost sight of this empire when we found ourselvesclose upon another, from whose shores there flew over our heads a flockof fowls a mile in breadth, and two hundred and forty miles long; sothat, although they flew a mile during every minute, it required no lessthan four hours for the whole flock to pass over us--in which there wereseveral millions of millions of fowl.'&quot; (*17)&quot;Oh fy!&quot; said the king.&quot;'No sooner had we got rid of these birds, which occasioned us greatannoyance, than we were terrified by the appearance of a fowl of anotherkind, and infinitely larger than even the rocs which I met in myformer voyages; for it was bigger than the biggest of the domes on yourseraglio, oh, most Munificent of Caliphs. This terrible fowl had no headthat we could perceive, but was fashioned entirely of belly, which wasof a prodigious fatness and roundness, of a soft-looking substance,smooth, shining and striped with various colors. In its talons, themonster was bearing away to his eyrie in the heavens, a house from whichit had knocked off the roof, and in the interior of which we distinctlysaw human beings, who, beyond doubt, were in a state of frightfuldespair at the horrible fate which awaited them. We shouted with all ourmight, in the hope of frightening the bird into letting go of its prey,but it merely gave a snort or puff, as if of rage and then let fall uponour heads a heavy sack which proved to be filled with sand!'&quot;&quot;Stuff!&quot; said the king.&quot;'It was just after this adventure that we encountered a continent ofimmense extent and prodigious solidity, but which, nevertheless, wassupported entirely upon the back of a sky-blue cow that had no fewerthan four hundred horns.'&quot; (*18)&quot;That, now, I believe,&quot; said the king, &quot;because I have read something ofthe kind before, in a book.&quot;&quot;'We passed immediately beneath this continent, (swimming in between thelegs of the cow), and, after some hours, found ourselves in a wonderfulcountry indeed, which, I was informed by the man-animal, was his ownnative land, inhabited by things of his own species. This elevated theman-animal very much in my esteem, and in fact, I now began to feelashamed of the contemptuous familiarity with which I had treated him;for I found that the man-animals in general were a nation of the mostpowerful magicians, who lived with worms in their brain, (*19) which,no doubt, served to stimulate them by their painful writhings andwrigglings to the most miraculous efforts of imagination!'&quot;&quot;Nonsense!&quot; said the king.&quot;'Among the magicians, were domesticated several animals of verysingular kinds; for example, there was a huge horse whose bones wereiron and whose blood was boiling water. In place of corn, he had blackstones for his usual food; and yet, in spite of so hard a diet, he wasso strong and swift that he would drag a load more weighty than thegrandest temple in this city, at a rate surpassing that of the flight ofmost birds.'&quot; (*20)&quot;Twattle!&quot; said the king.&quot;'I saw, also, among these people a hen without feathers, but biggerthan a camel; instead of flesh and bone she had iron and brick; herblood, like that of the horse, (to whom, in fact, she was nearlyrelated,) was boiling water; and like him she ate nothing but wood orblack stones. This hen brought forth very frequently, a hundred chickensin the day; and, after birth, they took up their residence for severalweeks within the stomach of their mother.'&quot; (*21)&quot;Fa! lal!&quot; said the king.&quot;'One of this nation of mighty conjurors created a man out of brass andwood, and leather, and endowed him with such ingenuity that he wouldhave beaten at chess, all the race of mankind with the exception of thegreat Caliph, Haroun Alraschid. (*22) Another of these magi constructed(of like material) a creature that put to shame even the genius of himwho made it; for so great were its reasoning powers that, in a second,it performed calculations of so vast an extent that they would haverequired the united labor of fifty thousand fleshy men for a year. (*23)But a still more wonderful conjuror fashioned for himself a mighty thingthat was neither man nor beast, but which had brains of lead, intermixedwith a black matter like pitch, and fingers that it employed with suchincredible speed and dexterity that it would have had no trouble inwriting out twenty thousand copies of the Koran in an hour, and thiswith so exquisite a precision, that in all the copies there should notbe found one to vary from another by the breadth of the finest hair.This thing was of prodigious strength, so that it erected or overthrewthe mightiest empires at a breath; but its powers were exercised equallyfor evil and for good.'&quot;&quot;Ridiculous!&quot; said the king.&quot;'Among this nation of necromancers there was also one who had in hisveins the blood of the salamanders; for he made no scruple of sittingdown to smoke his chibouc in a red-hot oven until his dinner wasthoroughly roasted upon its floor. (*24) Another had the faculty ofconverting the common metals into gold, without even looking at themduring the process. (*25) Another had such a delicacy of touch that hemade a wire so fine as to be invisible. (*26) Another had such quicknessof perception that he counted all the separate motions of an elasticbody, while it was springing backward and forward at the rate of ninehundred millions of times in a second.'&quot; (*27)&quot;Absurd!&quot; said the king.&quot;'Another of these magicians, by means of a fluid that nobody ever yetsaw, could make the corpses of his friends brandish their arms, kick outtheir legs, fight, or even get up and dance at his will. (*28) Anotherhad cultivated his voice to so great an extent that he could have madehimself heard from one end of the world to the other. (*29) Another hadso long an arm that he could sit down in Damascus and indite a letterat Bagdad--or indeed at any distance whatsoever. (*30) Another commandedthe lightning to come down to him out of the heavens, and it came at hiscall; and served him for a plaything when it came. Another took twoloud sounds and out of them made a silence. Another constructed adeep darkness out of two brilliant lights. (*31) Another made ice in ared-hot furnace. (*32) Another directed the sun to paint his portrait,and the sun did. (*33) Another took this luminary with the moon and theplanets, and having first weighed them with scrupulous accuracy, probedinto their depths and found out the solidity of the substance of whichthey were made. But the whole nation is, indeed, of so surprising anecromantic ability, that not even their infants, nor their commonestcats and dogs have any difficulty in seeing objects that do not exist atall, or that for twenty millions of years before the birth of the nationitself had been blotted out from the face of creation.&quot;' (*34)&quot;Preposterous!&quot; said the king.&quot;'The wives and daughters of these incomparably great and wise magi,'&quot;continued Scheherazade, without being in any manner disturbed bythese frequent and most ungentlemanly interruptions on the part of herhusband--&quot;'the wives and daughters of these eminent conjurers are everything that is accomplished and refined; and would be every thing that isinteresting and beautiful, but for an unhappy fatality that besets them,and from which not even the miraculous powers of their husbands andfathers has, hitherto, been adequate to save. Some fatalities come incertain shapes, and some in others--but this of which I speak has comein the shape of a crotchet.'&quot;&quot;A what?&quot; said the king.&quot;'A crotchet'&quot; said Scheherazade. &quot;'One of the evil genii, who areperpetually upon the watch to inflict ill, has put it into the heads ofthese accomplished ladies that the thing which we describe as personalbeauty consists altogether in the protuberance of the region which liesnot very far below the small of the back. Perfection of loveliness, theysay, is in the direct ratio of the extent of this lump. Having been longpossessed of this idea, and bolsters being cheap in that country, thedays have long gone by since it was possible to distinguish a woman froma dromedary-'&quot;&quot;Stop!&quot; said the king--&quot;I can't stand that, and I won't. You havealready given me a dreadful headache with your lies. The day, too, Iperceive, is beginning to break. How long have we been married?--myconscience is getting to be troublesome again. And then that dromedarytouch--do you take me for a fool? Upon the whole, you might as well getup and be throttled.&quot;These words, as I learn from the &quot;Isitsoornot,&quot; both grieved andastonished Scheherazade; but, as she knew the king to be a man ofscrupulous integrity, and quite unlikely to forfeit his word, shesubmitted to her fate with a good grace. She derived, however, greatconsolation, (during the tightening of the bowstring,) from thereflection that much of the history remained still untold, and that thepetulance of her brute of a husband had reaped for him a most righteousreward, in depriving him of many inconceivable adventures.A DESCENT INTO THE MAELSTRÃM.  The ways of God in Nature, as in Providence, are not as our  ways;  nor are the models that we frame any way commensurate to the  vastness, profundity, and unsearchableness of His works, which have  a depth in them greater than the well of Democritus.  Joseph Glanville.WE had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag. For some minutes theold man seemed too much exhausted to speak.&quot;Not long ago,&quot; said he at length, &quot;and I could have guided you on thisroute as well as the youngest of my sons; but, about three years past,there happened to me an event such as never happened to mortal man--orat least such as no man ever survived to tell of--and the six hours ofdeadly terror which I then endured have broken me up body and soul. Yousuppose me a _very_ old man--but I am not. It took less than a singleday to change these hairs from a jetty black to white, to weakenmy limbs, and to unstring my nerves, so that I tremble at the leastexertion, and am frightened at a shadow. Do you know I can scarcely lookover this little cliff without getting giddy?&quot;The &quot;little cliff,&quot; upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown himselfdown to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung over it, whilehe was only kept from falling by the tenure of his elbow on its extremeand slippery edge--this &quot;little cliff&quot; arose, a sheer unobstructedprecipice of black shining rock, some fifteen or sixteen hundred feetfrom the world of crags beneath us. Nothing would have tempted me towithin half a dozen yards of its brink. In truth so deeply was I excitedby the perilous position of my companion, that I fell at full lengthupon the ground, clung to the shrubs around me, and dared not evenglance upward at the sky--while I struggled in vain to divest myself ofthe idea that the very foundations of the mountain were in danger fromthe fury of the winds. It was long before I could reason myself intosufficient courage to sit up and look out into the distance.&quot;You must get over these fancies,&quot; said the guide, &quot;for I have broughtyou here that you might have the best possible view of the scene of thatevent I mentioned--and to tell you the whole story with the spot justunder your eye.&quot;&quot;We are now,&quot; he continued, in that particularizing manner whichdistinguished him--&quot;we are now close upon the Norwegian coast--in thesixty-eighth degree of latitude--in the great province of Nordland--andin the dreary district of Lofoden. The mountain upon whose top we sit isHelseggen, the Cloudy. Now raise yourself up a little higher--hold on tothe grass if you feel giddy--so--and look out, beyond the belt of vaporbeneath us, into the sea.&quot;I looked dizzily, and beheld a wide expanse of ocean, whose waters woreso inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the Nubian geographer'saccount of the _Mare Tenebrarum_. A panorama more deplorably desolate nohuman imagination can conceive. To the right and left, as far as the eyecould reach, there lay outstretched, like ramparts of the world, linesof horridly black and beetling cliff, whose character of gloom was butthe more forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up againstits white and ghastly crest, howling and shrieking forever. Justopposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed, and at adistance of some five or six miles out at sea, there was visiblea small, bleak-looking island; or, more properly, its position wasdiscernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was enveloped.About two miles nearer the land, arose another of smaller size,hideously craggy and barren, and encompassed at various intervals by acluster of dark rocks.The appearance of the ocean, in the space between the more distantisland and the shore, had something very unusual about it. Although,at the time, so strong a gale was blowing landward that a brig in theremote offing lay to under a double-reefed trysail, and constantlyplunged her whole hull out of sight, still there was here nothing like aregular swell, but only a short, quick, angry cross dashing of water inevery direction--as well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise. Of foamthere was little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks.&quot;The island in the distance,&quot; resumed the old man, &quot;is called bythe Norwegians Vurrgh. The one midway is Moskoe. That a mile to thenorthward is Ambaaren. Yonder are Islesen, Hotholm, Keildhelm, Suarven,and Buckholm. Farther off--between Moskoe and Vurrgh--are Otterholm,Flimen, Sandflesen, and Stockholm. These are the true names of theplaces--but why it has been thought necessary to name them at all, ismore than either you or I can understand. Do you hear anything? Do yousee any change in the water?&quot;We had now been about ten minutes upon the top of Helseggen, to whichwe had ascended from the interior of Lofoden, so that we had caught noglimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from the summit. As theold man spoke, I became aware of a loud and gradually increasing sound,like the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an American prairie;and at the same moment I perceived that what seamen term the _chopping_character of the ocean beneath us, was rapidly changing into a currentwhich set to the eastward. Even while I gazed, this current acquireda monstrous velocity. Each moment added to its speed--to its headlongimpetuosity. In five minutes the whole sea, as far as Vurrgh, was lashedinto ungovernable fury; but it was between Moskoe and the coast that themain uproar held its sway. Here the vast bed of the waters, seamedand scarred into a thousand conflicting channels, burst suddenly intophrensied convulsion--heaving, boiling, hissing--gyrating in giganticand innumerable vortices, and all whirling and plunging on to theeastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes except inprecipitous descents.In a few minutes more, there came over the scene another radicalalteration. The general surface grew somewhat more smooth, and thewhirlpools, one by one, disappeared, while prodigious streaks of foambecame apparent where none had been seen before. These streaks,at length, spreading out to a great distance, and entering intocombination, took unto themselves the gyratory motion of thesubsided vortices, and seemed to form the germ of another more vast.Suddenly--very suddenly--this assumed a distinct and definite existence,in a circle of more than a mile in diameter. The edge of the whirl wasrepresented by a broad belt of gleaming spray; but no particle of thisslipped into the mouth of the terrific funnel, whose interior, as faras the eye could fathom it, was a smooth, shining, and jet-black wall ofwater, inclined to the horizon at an angle of some forty-five degrees,speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering motion,and sending forth to the winds an appalling voice, half shriek, halfroar, such as not even the mighty cataract of Niagara ever lifts up inits agony to Heaven.The mountain trembled to its very base, and the rock rocked. I threwmyself upon my face, and clung to the scant herbage in an excess ofnervous agitation.&quot;This,&quot; said I at length, to the old man--&quot;this _can_ be nothing elsethan the great whirlpool of the MaelstrÃ¶m.&quot;&quot;So it is sometimes termed,&quot; said he. &quot;We Norwegians call it theMoskoe-strÃ¶m, from the island of Moskoe in the midway.&quot;The ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared mefor what I saw. That of Jonas Ramus, which is perhaps the mostcircumstantial of any, cannot impart the faintest conception eitherof the magnificence, or of the horror of the scene--or of the wildbewildering sense of _the novel_ which confounds the beholder. I am notsure from what point of view the writer in question surveyed it, nor atwhat time; but it could neither have been from the summit of Helseggen,nor during a storm. There are some passages of his description,nevertheless, which may be quoted for their details, although theireffect is exceedingly feeble in conveying an impression of thespectacle.&quot;Between Lofoden and Moskoe,&quot; he says, &quot;the depth of the water isbetween thirty-six and forty fathoms; but on the other side, toward Ver(Vurrgh) this depth decreases so as not to afford a convenient passagefor a vessel, without the risk of splitting on the rocks, which happenseven in the calmest weather. When it is flood, the stream runs up thecountry between Lofoden and Moskoe with a boisterous rapidity; but theroar of its impetuous ebb to the sea is scarce equalled by the loudestand most dreadful cataracts; the noise being heard several leagues off,and the vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth, that if a shipcomes within its attraction, it is inevitably absorbed and carried downto the bottom, and there beat to pieces against the rocks; and whenthe water relaxes, the fragments thereof are thrown up again. But theseintervals of tranquility are only at the turn of the ebb and flood,and in calm weather, and last but a quarter of an hour, its violencegradually returning. When the stream is most boisterous, and its furyheightened by a storm, it is dangerous to come within a Norway mileof it. Boats, yachts, and ships have been carried away by not guardingagainst it before they were within its reach. It likewise happensfrequently, that whales come too near the stream, and are overpowered byits violence; and then it is impossible to describe their howlings andbellowings in their fruitless struggles to disengage themselves. Abear once, attempting to swim from Lofoden to Moskoe, was caught by thestream and borne down, while he roared terribly, so as to be heard onshore. Large stocks of firs and pine trees, after being absorbed by thecurrent, rise again broken and torn to such a degree as if bristles grewupon them. This plainly shows the bottom to consist of craggy rocks,among which they are whirled to and fro. This stream is regulated by theflux and reflux of the sea--it being constantly high and low water everysix hours. In the year 1645, early in the morning of Sexagesima Sunday,it raged with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones of thehouses on the coast fell to the ground.&quot;In regard to the depth of the water, I could not see how this could havebeen ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of the vortex. The&quot;forty fathoms&quot; must have reference only to portions of the channelclose upon the shore either of Moskoe or Lofoden. The depth in thecentre of the Moskoe-strÃ¶m must be immeasurably greater; and no betterproof of this fact is necessary than can be obtained from even thesidelong glance into the abyss of the whirl which may be had from thehighest crag of Helseggen. Looking down from this pinnacle upon thehowling Phlegethon below, I could not help smiling at the simplicitywith which the honest Jonas Ramus records, as a matter difficult ofbelief, the anecdotes of the whales and the bears; for it appeared tome, in fact, a self-evident thing, that the largest ship of the line inexistence, coming within the influence of that deadly attraction, couldresist it as little as a feather the hurricane, and must disappearbodily and at once.The attempts to account for the phenomenon--some of which, I remember,seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusal--now wore a verydifferent and unsatisfactory aspect. The idea generally received is thatthis, as well as three smaller vortices among the Ferroe islands, &quot;haveno other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling, at fluxand reflux, against a ridge of rocks and shelves, which confines thewater so that it precipitates itself like a cataract; and thus thehigher the flood rises, the deeper must the fall be, and the naturalresult of all is a whirlpool or vortex, the prodigious suction of whichis sufficiently known by lesser experiments.&quot;--These are the words ofthe EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica. Kircher and others imagine that in thecentre of the channel of the MaelstrÃ¶m is an abyss penetrating theglobe, and issuing in some very remote part--the Gulf of Bothnia beingsomewhat decidedly named in one instance. This opinion, idle in itself,was the one to which, as I gazed, my imagination most readily assented;and, mentioning it to the guide, I was rather surprised to hear him saythat, although it was the view almost universally entertained of thesubject by the Norwegians, it nevertheless was not his own. As to theformer notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it; and here Iagreed with him--for, however conclusive on paper, it becomes altogetherunintelligible, and even absurd, amid the thunder of the abyss.&quot;You have had a good look at the whirl now,&quot; said the old man, &quot;and ifyou will creep round this crag, so as to get in its lee, and deadenthe roar of the water, I will tell you a story that will convince you Iought to know something of the Moskoe-strÃ¶m.&quot;I placed myself as desired, and he proceeded.&quot;Myself and my two brothers once owned a schooner-rigged smack of aboutseventy tons burthen, with which we were in the habit of fishing amongthe islands beyond Moskoe, nearly to Vurrgh. In all violent eddies atsea there is good fishing, at proper opportunities, if one has only thecourage to attempt it; but among the whole of the Lofoden coastmen, wethree were the only ones who made a regular business of going out to theislands, as I tell you. The usual grounds are a great way lower down tothe southward. There fish can be got at all hours, without much risk,and therefore these places are preferred. The choice spots over hereamong the rocks, however, not only yield the finest variety, but in fargreater abundance; so that we often got in a single day, what the moretimid of the craft could not scrape together in a week. In fact, we madeit a matter of desperate speculation--the risk of life standing insteadof labor, and courage answering for capital.&quot;We kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast thanthis; and it was our practice, in fine weather, to take advantage ofthe fifteen minutes' slack to push across the main channel of theMoskoe-strÃ¶m, far above the pool, and then drop down upon anchoragesomewhere near Otterholm, or Sandflesen, where the eddies are not soviolent as elsewhere. Here we used to remain until nearly time forslack-water again, when we weighed and made for home. We never setout upon this expedition without a steady side wind for going andcoming--one that we felt sure would not fail us before our return--andwe seldom made a mis-calculation upon this point. Twice, during sixyears, we were forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a deadcalm, which is a rare thing indeed just about here; and once we had toremain on the grounds nearly a week, starving to death, owing to agale which blew up shortly after our arrival, and made the channel tooboisterous to be thought of. Upon this occasion we should have beendriven out to sea in spite of everything, (for the whirlpools threw usround and round so violently, that, at length, we fouled our anchorand dragged it) if it had not been that we drifted into one of theinnumerable cross currents--here to-day and gone to-morrow--which droveus under the lee of Flimen, where, by good luck, we brought up.&quot;I could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties weencountered 'on the grounds'--it is a bad spot to be in, even ingood weather--but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of theMoskoe-strÃ¶m itself without accident; although at times my heart hasbeen in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind or beforethe slack. The wind sometimes was not as strong as we thought it atstarting, and then we made rather less way than we could wish, whilethe current rendered the smack unmanageable. My eldest brother had a soneighteen years old, and I had two stout boys of my own. These would havebeen of great assistance at such times, in using the sweeps, as well asafterward in fishing--but, somehow, although we ran the risk ourselves,we had not the heart to let the young ones get into the danger--for,after all is said and done, it _was_ a horrible danger, and that is thetruth.&quot;It is now within a few days of three years since what I am going totell you occurred. It was on the tenth day of July, 18-, a day which thepeople of this part of the world will never forget--for it was onein which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out ofthe heavens. And yet all the morning, and indeed until late in theafternoon, there was a gentle and steady breeze from the south-west,while the sun shone brightly, so that the oldest seaman among us couldnot have foreseen what was to follow.&quot;The three of us--my two brothers and myself--had crossed over to theislands about two o'clock P. M., and had soon nearly loaded the smackwith fine fish, which, we all remarked, were more plenty that daythan we had ever known them. It was just seven, _by my watch_, when weweighed and started for home, so as to make the worst of the StrÃ¶m atslack water, which we knew would be at eight.&quot;We set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter, and for sometime spanked along at a great rate, never dreaming of danger, for indeedwe saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it. All at once wewere taken aback by a breeze from over Helseggen. This was mostunusual--something that had never happened to us before--and I began tofeel a little uneasy, without exactly knowing why. We put the boat onthe wind, but could make no headway at all for the eddies, and I wasupon the point of proposing to return to the anchorage, when, lookingastern, we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular copper-coloredcloud that rose with the most amazing velocity.&quot;In the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away, and wewere dead becalmed, drifting about in every direction. This state ofthings, however, did not last long enough to give us time to think aboutit. In less than a minute the storm was upon us--in less than two thesky was entirely overcast--and what with this and the driving spray, itbecame suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in the smack.&quot;Such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing. Theoldest seaman in Norway never experienced any thing like it. We had letour sails go by the run before it cleverly took us; but, at the firstpuff, both our masts went by the board as if they had been sawedoff--the mainmast taking with it my youngest brother, who had lashedhimself to it for safety.&quot;Our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon water.It had a complete flush deck, with only a small hatch near the bow, andthis hatch it had always been our custom to batten down when about tocross the StrÃ¶m, by way of precaution against the chopping seas. But forthis circumstance we should have foundered at once--for we lay entirelyburied for some moments. How my elder brother escaped destruction Icannot say, for I never had an opportunity of ascertaining. For my part,as soon as I had let the foresail run, I threw myself flat on deck,with my feet against the narrow gunwale of the bow, and with my handsgrasping a ring-bolt near the foot of the fore-mast. It was mereinstinct that prompted me to do this--which was undoubtedly the verybest thing I could have done--for I was too much flurried to think.&quot;For some moments we were completely deluged, as I say, and all thistime I held my breath, and clung to the bolt. When I could stand it nolonger I raised myself upon my knees, still keeping hold with my hands,and thus got my head clear. Presently our little boat gave herselfa shake, just as a dog does in coming out of the water, and thus ridherself, in some measure, of the seas. I was now trying to get thebetter of the stupor that had come over me, and to collect my senses soas to see what was to be done, when I felt somebody grasp my arm. It wasmy elder brother, and my heart leaped for joy, for I had made surethat he was overboard--but the next moment all this joy was turned intohorror--for he put his mouth close to my ear, and screamed out the word'_Moskoe-strÃ¶m!_'&quot;No one ever will know what my feelings were at that moment. I shookfrom head to foot as if I had had the most violent fit of the ague. Iknew what he meant by that one word well enough--I knew what he wishedto make me understand. With the wind that now drove us on, we were boundfor the whirl of the StrÃ¶m, and nothing could save us!&quot;You perceive that in crossing the StrÃ¶m _channel_, we always went along way up above the whirl, even in the calmest weather, and then hadto wait and watch carefully for the slack--but now we were driving rightupon the pool itself, and in such a hurricane as this! 'To be sure,' Ithought, 'we shall get there just about the slack--there is some littlehope in that'--but in the next moment I cursed myself for being so greata fool as to dream of hope at all. I knew very well that we were doomed,had we been ten times a ninety-gun ship.&quot;By this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself, or perhapswe did not feel it so much, as we scudded before it, but at all eventsthe seas, which at first had been kept down by the wind, and lay flatand frothing, now got up into absolute mountains. A singular change,too, had come over the heavens. Around in every direction it was stillas black as pitch, but nearly overhead there burst out, all at once, acircular rift of clear sky--as clear as I ever saw--and of a deep brightblue--and through it there blazed forth the full moon with a lustre thatI never before knew her to wear. She lit up every thing about us withthe greatest distinctness--but, oh God, what a scene it was to light up!&quot;I now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother--but, in somemanner which I could not understand, the din had so increased that Icould not make him hear a single word, although I screamed at the topof my voice in his ear. Presently he shook his head, looking as pale asdeath, and held up one of his fingers, as if to say _'listen! '_&quot;At first I could not make out what he meant--but soon a hideous thoughtflashed upon me. I dragged my watch from its fob. It was not going. Iglanced at its face by the moonlight, and then burst into tears as Iflung it far away into the ocean. _It had run down at seven o'clock!We were behind the time of the slack, and the whirl of the StrÃ¶m was infull fury!_&quot;When a boat is well built, properly trimmed, and not deep laden, thewaves in a strong gale, when she is going large, seem always to slipfrom beneath her--which appears very strange to a landsman--and this iswhat is called _riding_, in sea phrase. Well, so far we had ridden theswells very cleverly; but presently a gigantic sea happened to take usright under the counter, and bore us with it as it rose--up--up--asif into the sky. I would not have believed that any wave could rise sohigh. And then down we came with a sweep, a slide, and a plunge,that made me feel sick and dizzy, as if I was falling from some loftymountain-top in a dream. But while we were up I had thrown a quickglance around--and that one glance was all sufficient. I saw our exactposition in an instant. The Moskoe-StrÃ¶m whirlpool was about a quarterof a mile dead ahead--but no more like the every-day Moskoe-StrÃ¶m, thanthe whirl as you now see it is like a mill-race. If I had not knownwhere we were, and what we had to expect, I should not have recognisedthe place at all. As it was, I involuntarily closed my eyes in horror.The lids clenched themselves together as if in a spasm.&quot;It could not have been more than two minutes afterward until wesuddenly felt the waves subside, and were enveloped in foam. Theboat made a sharp half turn to larboard, and then shot off in its newdirection like a thunderbolt. At the same moment the roaring noise ofthe water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill shriek--such asound as you might imagine given out by the waste-pipes of many thousandsteam-vessels, letting off their steam all together. We were now in thebelt of surf that always surrounds the whirl; and I thought, of course,that another moment would plunge us into the abyss--down which we couldonly see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which wewore borne along. The boat did not seem to sink into the water atall, but to skim like an air-bubble upon the surface of the surge. Herstarboard side was next the whirl, and on the larboard arose the worldof ocean we had left. It stood like a huge writhing wall between us andthe horizon.&quot;It may appear strange, but now, when we were in the very jaws of thegulf, I felt more composed than when we were only approaching it. Havingmade up my mind to hope no more, I got rid of a great deal of thatterror which unmanned me at first. I suppose it was despair that strungmy nerves.&quot;It may look like boasting--but what I tell you is truth--I began toreflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a manner, and howfoolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration as my ownindividual life, in view of so wonderful a manifestation of God's power.I do believe that I blushed with shame when this idea crossed my mind.After a little while I became possessed with the keenest curiosity aboutthe whirl itself. I positively felt a _wish_ to explore its depths, evenat the sacrifice I was going to make; and my principal grief was thatI should never be able to tell my old companions on shore about themysteries I should see. These, no doubt, were singular fancies to occupya man's mind in such extremity--and I have often thought since, that therevolutions of the boat around the pool might have rendered me a littlelight-headed.&quot;There was another circumstance which tended to restore myself-possession; and this was the cessation of the wind, which could notreach us in our present situation--for, as you saw yourself, the belt ofsurf is considerably lower than the general bed of the ocean, and thislatter now towered above us, a high, black, mountainous ridge. If youhave never been at sea in a heavy gale, you can form no idea of theconfusion of mind occasioned by the wind and spray together. Theyblind, deafen, and strangle you, and take away all power of actionor reflection. But we were now, in a great measure, rid of theseannoyances--just as death-condemned felons in prison are allowed pettyindulgences, forbidden them while their doom is yet uncertain.&quot;How often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to say.We careered round and round for perhaps an hour, flying rather thanfloating, getting gradually more and more into the middle of the surge,and then nearer and nearer to its horrible inner edge. All this time Ihad never let go of the ring-bolt. My brother was at the stern, holdingon to a small empty water-cask which had been securely lashed under thecoop of the counter, and was the only thing on deck that had not beenswept overboard when the gale first took us. As we approached the brinkof the pit he let go his hold upon this, and made for the ring, fromwhich, in the agony of his terror, he endeavored to force my hands, asit was not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp. I never feltdeeper grief than when I saw him attempt this act--although I knew hewas a madman when he did it--a raving maniac through sheer fright. I didnot care, however, to contest the point with him. I knew it could makeno difference whether either of us held on at all; so I let him have thebolt, and went astern to the cask. This there was no great difficultyin doing; for the smack flew round steadily enough, and upon an evenkeel--only swaying to and fro, with the immense sweeps and swelters ofthe whirl. Scarcely had I secured myself in my new position, when wegave a wild lurch to starboard, and rushed headlong into the abyss. Imuttered a hurried prayer to God, and thought all was over.&quot;As I felt the sickening sweep of the descent, I had instinctivelytightened my hold upon the barrel, and closed my eyes. For some secondsI dared not open them--while I expected instant destruction, andwondered that I was not already in my death-struggles with the water.But moment after moment elapsed. I still lived. The sense of falling hadceased; and the motion of the vessel seemed much as it had been before,while in the belt of foam, with the exception that she now lay morealong. I took courage, and looked once again upon the scene.&quot;Never shall I forget the sensations of awe, horror, and admiration withwhich I gazed about me. The boat appeared to be hanging, as if bymagic, midway down, upon the interior surface of a funnel vast incircumference, prodigious in depth, and whose perfectly smooth sidesmight have been mistaken for ebony, but for the bewildering rapiditywith which they spun around, and for the gleaming and ghastly radiancethey shot forth, as the rays of the full moon, from that circular riftamid the clouds which I have already described, streamed in a flood ofgolden glory along the black walls, and far away down into the inmostrecesses of the abyss.&quot;At first I was too much confused to observe anything accurately.The general burst of terrific grandeur was all that I beheld. When Irecovered myself a little, however, my gaze fell instinctively downward.In this direction I was able to obtain an unobstructed view, from themanner in which the smack hung on the inclined surface of the pool. Shewas quite upon an even keel--that is to say, her deck lay in a planeparallel with that of the water--but this latter sloped at an angle ofmore than forty-five degrees, so that we seemed to be lying upon ourbeam-ends. I could not help observing, nevertheless, that I had scarcelymore difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in this situation,than if we had been upon a dead level; and this, I suppose, was owing tothe speed at which we revolved.&quot;The rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the profoundgulf; but still I could make out nothing distinctly, on account of athick mist in which everything there was enveloped, and over which therehung a magnificent rainbow, like that narrow and tottering bridge whichMussulmen say is the only pathway between Time and Eternity. This mist,or spray, was no doubt occasioned by the clashing of the great walls ofthe funnel, as they all met together at the bottom--but the yell thatwent up to the Heavens from out of that mist, I dare not attempt todescribe.&quot;Our first slide into the abyss itself, from the belt of foam above, hadcarried us a great distance down the slope; but our farther descentwas by no means proportionate. Round and round we swept--not withany uniform movement--but in dizzying swings and jerks, that sentus sometimes only a few hundred yards--sometimes nearly the completecircuit of the whirl. Our progress downward, at each revolution, wasslow, but very perceptible.&quot;Looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we werethus borne, I perceived that our boat was not the only object in theembrace of the whirl. Both above and below us were visible fragments ofvessels, large masses of building timber and trunks of trees, withmany smaller articles, such as pieces of house furniture, broken boxes,barrels and staves. I have already described the unnatural curiositywhich had taken the place of my original terrors. It appeared to growupon me as I drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom. I now began towatch, with a strange interest, the numerous things that floated in ourcompany. I _must_ have been delirious--for I even sought _amusement_in speculating upon the relative velocities of their several descentstoward the foam below. 'This fir tree,' I found myself at one timesaying, 'will certainly be the next thing that takes the awful plungeand disappears,'--and then I was disappointed to find that the wreck ofa Dutch merchant ship overtook it and went down before. At length, aftermaking several guesses of this nature, and being deceived in all--thisfact--the fact of my invariable miscalculation--set me upon a train ofreflection that made my limbs again tremble, and my heart beat heavilyonce more.&quot;It was not a new terror that thus affected me, but the dawn of a moreexciting _hope_. This hope arose partly from memory, and partly frompresent observation. I called to mind the great variety of buoyantmatter that strewed the coast of Lofoden, having been absorbed andthen thrown forth by the Moskoe-strÃ¶m. By far the greater number of thearticles were shattered in the most extraordinary way--so chafedand roughened as to have the appearance of being stuck full ofsplinters--but then I distinctly recollected that there were _some_ ofthem which were not disfigured at all. Now I could not account for thisdifference except by supposing that the roughened fragments were theonly ones which had been _completely absorbed_--that the others hadentered the whirl at so late a period of the tide, or, for some reason,had descended so slowly after entering, that they did not reach thebottom before the turn of the flood came, or of the ebb, as the casemight be. I conceived it possible, in either instance, that they mightthus be whirled up again to the level of the ocean, without undergoingthe fate of those which had been drawn in more early, or absorbed morerapidly. I made, also, three important observations. The first was,that, as a general rule, the larger the bodies were, the more rapidtheir descent--the second, that, between two masses of equal extent, theone spherical, and the other _of any other shape_, the superiorityin speed of descent was with the sphere--the third, that, between twomasses of equal size, the one cylindrical, and the other of any othershape, the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly. Since my escape, Ihave had several conversations on this subject with an old school-masterof the district; and it was from him that I learned the use of the words'cylinder' and 'sphere.' He explained to me--although I have forgottenthe explanation--how what I observed was, in fact, the naturalconsequence of the forms of the floating fragments--and showed me how ithappened that a cylinder, swimming in a vortex, offered more resistanceto its suction, and was drawn in with greater difficulty than an equallybulky body, of any form whatever. (*1)&quot;There was one startling circumstance which went a great way inenforcing these observations, and rendering me anxious to turn them toaccount, and this was that, at every revolution, we passed somethinglike a barrel, or else the yard or the mast of a vessel, while many ofthese things, which had been on our level when I first opened my eyesupon the wonders of the whirlpool, were now high up above us, and seemedto have moved but little from their original station.&quot;I no longer hesitated what to do. I resolved to lash myself securely tothe water cask upon which I now held, to cut it loose from the counter,and to throw myself with it into the water. I attracted my brother'sattention by signs, pointed to the floating barrels that came near us,and did everything in my power to make him understand what I was aboutto do. I thought at length that he comprehended my design--but, whetherthis was the case or not, he shook his head despairingly, and refused tomove from his station by the ring-bolt. It was impossible to reach him;the emergency admitted of no delay; and so, with a bitter struggle, Iresigned him to his fate, fastened myself to the cask by means of thelashings which secured it to the counter, and precipitated myself withit into the sea, without another moment's hesitation.&quot;The result was precisely what I had hoped it might be. As it is myselfwho now tell you this tale--as you see that I _did_ escape--and as youare already in possession of the mode in which this escape was effected,and must therefore anticipate all that I have farther to say--I willbring my story quickly to conclusion. It might have been an hour, orthereabout, after my quitting the smack, when, having descended to avast distance beneath me, it made three or four wild gyrations in rapidsuccession, and, bearing my loved brother with it, plunged headlong, atonce and forever, into the chaos of foam below. The barrel to which Iwas attached sunk very little farther than half the distance between thebottom of the gulf and the spot at which I leaped overboard, before agreat change took place in the character of the whirlpool. The slope ofthe sides of the vast funnel became momently less and less steep.The gyrations of the whirl grew, gradually, less and less violent. Bydegrees, the froth and the rainbow disappeared, and the bottom of thegulf seemed slowly to uprise. The sky was clear, the winds had gonedown, and the full moon was setting radiantly in the west, when Ifound myself on the surface of the ocean, in full view of the shoresof Lofoden, and above the spot where the pool of the Moskoe-strÃ¶m_had been_. It was the hour of the slack--but the sea still heavedin mountainous waves from the effects of the hurricane. I was borneviolently into the channel of the StrÃ¶m, and in a few minutes washurried down the coast into the 'grounds' of the fishermen. A boatpicked me up--exhausted from fatigue--and (now that the danger wasremoved) speechless from the memory of its horror. Those who drew me onboard were my old mates and daily companions--but they knew me no morethan they would have known a traveller from the spirit-land. My hairwhich had been raven-black the day before, was as white as you seeit now. They say too that the whole expression of my countenance hadchanged. I told them my story--they did not believe it. I now tell itto _you_--and I can scarcely expect you to put more faith in it than didthe merry fishermen of Lofoden.&quot;VON KEMPELEN AND HIS DISCOVERYAFTER THE very minute and elaborate paper by Arago, to say nothing ofthe summary in 'Silliman's Journal,' with the detailed statement justpublished by Lieutenant Maury, it will not be supposed, of course,that in offering a few hurried remarks in reference to Von Kempelen'sdiscovery, I have any design to look at the subject in a scientificpoint of view. My object is simply, in the first place, to say a fewwords of Von Kempelen himself (with whom, some years ago, I had thehonor of a slight personal acquaintance), since every thing whichconcerns him must necessarily, at this moment, be of interest; and, inthe second place, to look in a general way, and speculatively, at theresults of the discovery.It may be as well, however, to premise the cursory observations whichI have to offer, by denying, very decidedly, what seems to be ageneral impression (gleaned, as usual in a case of this kind, from thenewspapers), viz.: that this discovery, astounding as it unquestionablyis, is unanticipated.By reference to the 'Diary of Sir Humphrey Davy' (Cottle and Munroe,London, pp. 150), it will be seen at pp. 53 and 82, that thisillustrious chemist had not only conceived the idea now in question,but had actually made no inconsiderable progress, experimentally, in thevery identical analysis now so triumphantly brought to an issue by VonKempelen, who although he makes not the slightest allusion to it, is,without doubt (I say it unhesitatingly, and can prove it, if required),indebted to the 'Diary' for at least the first hint of his ownundertaking.The paragraph from the 'Courier and Enquirer,' which is now going therounds of the press, and which purports to claim the invention for aMr. Kissam, of Brunswick, Maine, appears to me, I confess, a littleapocryphal, for several reasons; although there is nothing eitherimpossible or very improbable in the statement made. I need not go intodetails. My opinion of the paragraph is founded principally upon itsmanner. It does not look true. Persons who are narrating facts, areseldom so particular as Mr. Kissam seems to be, about day and date andprecise location. Besides, if Mr. Kissam actually did come upon thediscovery he says he did, at the period designated--nearly eight yearsago--how happens it that he took no steps, on the instant, to reap theimmense benefits which the merest bumpkin must have known would haveresulted to him individually, if not to the world at large, from thediscovery? It seems to me quite incredible that any man of commonunderstanding could have discovered what Mr. Kissam says he did, and yethave subsequently acted so like a baby--so like an owl--as Mr. Kissamadmits that he did. By-the-way, who is Mr. Kissam? and is not the wholeparagraph in the 'Courier and Enquirer' a fabrication got up to 'makea talk'? It must be confessed that it has an amazingly moon-hoaxy-air.Very little dependence is to be placed upon it, in my humble opinion;and if I were not well aware, from experience, how very easily men ofscience are mystified, on points out of their usual range of inquiry,I should be profoundly astonished at finding so eminent a chemist asProfessor Draper, discussing Mr. Kissam's (or is it Mr. Quizzem's?)pretensions to the discovery, in so serious a tone.But to return to the 'Diary' of Sir Humphrey Davy. This pamphlet was notdesigned for the public eye, even upon the decease of the writer, as anyperson at all conversant with authorship may satisfy himself at once bythe slightest inspection of the style. At page 13, for example, near themiddle, we read, in reference to his researches about the protoxideof azote: 'In less than half a minute the respiration being continued,diminished gradually and were succeeded by analogous to gentle pressureon all the muscles.' That the respiration was not 'diminished,' is notonly clear by the subsequent context, but by the use of the plural,'were.' The sentence, no doubt, was thus intended: 'In less than halfa minute, the respiration [being continued, these feelings] diminishedgradually, and were succeeded by [a sensation] analogous to gentlepressure on all the muscles.' A hundred similar instances go to showthat the MS. so inconsiderately published, was merely a rough note-book,meant only for the writer's own eye, but an inspection of the pamphletwill convince almost any thinking person of the truth of my suggestion.The fact is, Sir Humphrey Davy was about the last man in the worldto commit himself on scientific topics. Not only had he a more thanordinary dislike to quackery, but he was morbidly afraid of appearingempirical; so that, however fully he might have been convinced that hewas on the right track in the matter now in question, he would neverhave spoken out, until he had every thing ready for the most practicaldemonstration. I verily believe that his last moments would have beenrendered wretched, could he have suspected that his wishes in regardto burning this 'Diary' (full of crude speculations) would have beenunattended to; as, it seems, they were. I say 'his wishes,' for that hemeant to include this note-book among the miscellaneous papers directed'to be burnt,' I think there can be no manner of doubt. Whether itescaped the flames by good fortune or by bad, yet remains to be seen.That the passages quoted above, with the other similar ones referred to,gave Von Kempelen the hint, I do not in the slightest degree question;but I repeat, it yet remains to be seen whether this momentous discoveryitself (momentous under any circumstances) will be of service ordisservice to mankind at large. That Von Kempelen and his immediatefriends will reap a rich harvest, it would be folly to doubt for amoment. They will scarcely be so weak as not to 'realize,' in time, bylarge purchases of houses and land, with other property of intrinsicvalue.In the brief account of Von Kempelen which appeared in the'Home Journal,' and has since been extensively copied, severalmisapprehensions of the German original seem to have been made by thetranslator, who professes to have taken the passage from a late numberof the Presburg 'Schnellpost.' 'Viele' has evidently been misconceived(as it often is), and what the translator renders by 'sorrows,' isprobably 'lieden,' which, in its true version, 'sufferings,' would givea totally different complexion to the whole account; but, of course,much of this is merely guess, on my part.Von Kempelen, however, is by no means 'a misanthrope,' in appearance, atleast, whatever he may be in fact. My acquaintance with him was casualaltogether; and I am scarcely warranted in saying that I know himat all; but to have seen and conversed with a man of so prodigious anotoriety as he has attained, or will attain in a few days, is not asmall matter, as times go.'The Literary World' speaks of him, confidently, as a native of Presburg(misled, perhaps, by the account in 'The Home Journal') but I am pleasedin being able to state positively, since I have it from his own lips,that he was born in Utica, in the State of New York, although both hisparents, I believe, are of Presburg descent. The family is connected, insome way, with Maelzel, of Automaton-chess-player memory. In person, heis short and stout, with large, fat, blue eyes, sandy hair and whiskers,a wide but pleasing mouth, fine teeth, and I think a Roman nose. Thereis some defect in one of his feet. His address is frank, and his wholemanner noticeable for bonhomie. Altogether, he looks, speaks, andacts as little like 'a misanthrope' as any man I ever saw. We werefellow-sojourners for a week about six years ago, at Earl's Hotel, inProvidence, Rhode Island; and I presume that I conversed with him, atvarious times, for some three or four hours altogether. His principaltopics were those of the day, and nothing that fell from him led meto suspect his scientific attainments. He left the hotel before me,intending to go to New York, and thence to Bremen; it was in the lattercity that his great discovery was first made public; or, rather, it wasthere that he was first suspected of having made it. This is about allthat I personally know of the now immortal Von Kempelen; but I havethought that even these few details would have interest for the public.There can be little question that most of the marvellous rumors afloatabout this affair are pure inventions, entitled to about as much creditas the story of Aladdin's lamp; and yet, in a case of this kind, as inthe case of the discoveries in California, it is clear that the truthmay be stranger than fiction. The following anecdote, at least, is sowell authenticated, that we may receive it implicitly.Von Kempelen had never been even tolerably well off during his residenceat Bremen; and often, it was well known, he had been put to extremeshifts in order to raise trifling sums. When the great excitementoccurred about the forgery on the house of Gutsmuth &amp; Co., suspicionwas directed toward Von Kempelen, on account of his having purchaseda considerable property in Gasperitch Lane, and his refusing, whenquestioned, to explain how he became possessed of the purchase money. Hewas at length arrested, but nothing decisive appearing against him, wasin the end set at liberty. The police, however, kept a strict watch uponhis movements, and thus discovered that he left home frequently, takingalways the same road, and invariably giving his watchers the slip in theneighborhood of that labyrinth of narrow and crooked passages knownby the flash name of the 'Dondergat.' Finally, by dint of greatperseverance, they traced him to a garret in an old house of sevenstories, in an alley called Flatzplatz,--and, coming upon him suddenly,found him, as they imagined, in the midst of his counterfeitingoperations. His agitation is represented as so excessive that theofficers had not the slightest doubt of his guilt. After hand-cuffinghim, they searched his room, or rather rooms, for it appears he occupiedall the mansarde.Opening into the garret where they caught him, was a closet, ten feet byeight, fitted up with some chemical apparatus, of which the object hasnot yet been ascertained. In one corner of the closet was a very smallfurnace, with a glowing fire in it, and on the fire a kind of duplicatecrucible--two crucibles connected by a tube. One of these crucibles wasnearly full of lead in a state of fusion, but not reaching up to theaperture of the tube, which was close to the brim. The other cruciblehad some liquid in it, which, as the officers entered, seemed to befuriously dissipating in vapor. They relate that, on finding himselftaken, Kempelen seized the crucibles with both hands (which were encasedin gloves that afterwards turned out to be asbestic), and threw thecontents on the tiled floor. It was now that they hand-cuffed him; andbefore proceeding to ransack the premises they searched his person, butnothing unusual was found about him, excepting a paper parcel, in hiscoat-pocket, containing what was afterward ascertained to be a mixtureof antimony and some unknown substance, in nearly, but not quite, equalproportions. All attempts at analyzing the unknown substance have,so far, failed, but that it will ultimately be analyzed, is not to bedoubted.Passing out of the closet with their prisoner, the officers went througha sort of ante-chamber, in which nothing material was found, to thechemist's sleeping-room. They here rummaged some drawers and boxes,but discovered only a few papers, of no importance, and some good coin,silver and gold. At length, looking under the bed, they saw a large,common hair trunk, without hinges, hasp, or lock, and with the top lyingcarelessly across the bottom portion. Upon attempting to draw this trunkout from under the bed, they found that, with their united strength(there were three of them, all powerful men), they 'could not stir itone inch.' Much astonished at this, one of them crawled under the bed,and looking into the trunk, said:'No wonder we couldn't move it--why it's full to the brim of old bits ofbrass!'Putting his feet, now, against the wall so as to get a good purchase,and pushing with all his force, while his companions pulled with alltheirs, the trunk, with much difficulty, was slid out from under thebed, and its contents examined. The supposed brass with which it wasfilled was all in small, smooth pieces, varying from the size of a peato that of a dollar; but the pieces were irregular in shape, althoughmore or less flat-looking, upon the whole, 'very much as lead looks whenthrown upon the ground in a molten state, and there suffered to growcool.' Now, not one of these officers for a moment suspected this metalto be any thing but brass. The idea of its being gold never enteredtheir brains, of course; how could such a wild fancy have entered it?And their astonishment may be well conceived, when the next day itbecame known, all over Bremen, that the 'lot of brass' which theyhad carted so contemptuously to the police office, without puttingthemselves to the trouble of pocketing the smallest scrap, was not onlygold--real gold--but gold far finer than any employed in coinage-gold,in fact, absolutely pure, virgin, without the slightest appreciablealloy.I need not go over the details of Von Kempelen's confession (as far asit went) and release, for these are familiar to the public. That he hasactually realized, in spirit and in effect, if not to the letter, theold chimaera of the philosopher's stone, no sane person is at libertyto doubt. The opinions of Arago are, of course, entitled to the greatestconsideration; but he is by no means infallible; and what he says ofbismuth, in his report to the Academy, must be taken cum grano salis.The simple truth is, that up to this period all analysis has failed; anduntil Von Kempelen chooses to let us have the key to his own publishedenigma, it is more than probable that the matter will remain, for years,in statu quo. All that as yet can fairly be said to be known is, that'Pure gold can be made at will, and very readily from lead in connectionwith certain other substances, in kind and in proportions, unknown.'Speculation, of course, is busy as to the immediate and ultimate resultsof this discovery--a discovery which few thinking persons will hesitatein referring to an increased interest in the matter of gold generally,by the late developments in California; and this reflection brings usinevitably to another--the exceeding inopportuneness of Von Kempelen'sanalysis. If many were prevented from adventuring to California, by themere apprehension that gold would so materially diminish in value,on account of its plentifulness in the mines there, as to renderthe speculation of going so far in search of it a doubtful one--whatimpression will be wrought now, upon the minds of those about toemigrate, and especially upon the minds of those actually in themineral region, by the announcement of this astounding discovery of VonKempelen? a discovery which declares, in so many words, that beyond itsintrinsic worth for manufacturing purposes (whatever that worth may be),gold now is, or at least soon will be (for it cannot be supposed thatVon Kempelen can long retain his secret), of no greater value thanlead, and of far inferior value to silver. It is, indeed, exceedinglydifficult to speculate prospectively upon the consequences of thediscovery, but one thing may be positively maintained--that theannouncement of the discovery six months ago would have had materialinfluence in regard to the settlement of California.In Europe, as yet, the most noticeable results have been a rise of twohundred per cent. in the price of lead, and nearly twenty-five per cent.that of silver.MESMERIC REVELATION WHATEVER doubt may still envelop the _rationale_ of mesmerism,its startling _facts_ are now almost universally admitted. Of theselatter, those who doubt, are your mere doubters by profession--anunprofitable and disreputable tribe. There can be no more absolute wasteof time than the attempt to _prove_, at the present day, that man, bymere exercise of will, can so impress his fellow, as to cast him into anabnormal condition, of which the phenomena resemble very closely thoseof _death_, or at least resemble them more nearly than they do thephenomena of any other normal condition within our cognizance; that,while in this state, the person so impressed employs only with effort,and then feebly, the external organs of sense, yet perceives, withkeenly refined perception, and through channels supposed unknown,matters beyond the scope of the physical organs; that, moreover, hisintellectual faculties are wonderfully exalted and invigorated; that hissympathies with the person so impressing him are profound; and, finally,that his susceptibility to the impression increases with its frequency,while, in the same proportion, the peculiar phenomena elicited are moreextended and more _pronounced_. I say that these--which are the laws of mesmerism in itsgeneral features--it would be supererogation to demonstrate; nor shall Iinflict upon my readers so needless a demonstration; to-day. My purposeat present is a very different one indeed. I am impelled, even inthe teeth of a world of prejudice, to detail without comment the veryremarkable substance of a colloquy, occurring between a sleep-waker andmyself. I had been long in the habit of mesmerizing the person inquestion, (Mr. Vankirk,) and the usual acute susceptibility andexaltation of the mesmeric perception had supervened. For many months hehad been laboring under confirmed phthisis, the more distressing effectsof which had been relieved by my manipulations; and on the night ofWednesday, the fifteenth instant, I was summoned to his bedside. The invalid was suffering with acute pain in the region of theheart, and breathed with great difficulty, having all the ordinarysymptoms of asthma. In spasms such as these he had usually found relieffrom the application of mustard to the nervous centres, but to-nightthis had been attempted in vain. As I entered his room he greeted me with a cheerful smile, andalthough evidently in much bodily pain, appeared to be, mentally, quiteat ease. &quot;I sent for you to-night,&quot; he said, &quot;not so much to administerto my bodily ailment, as to satisfy me concerning certain psychalimpressions which, of late, have occasioned me much anxiety andsurprise. I need not tell you how sceptical I have hitherto been on thetopic of the soul's immortality. I cannot deny that there has alwaysexisted, as if in that very soul which I have been denying, a vaguehalf-sentiment of its own existence. But this half-sentiment at notime amounted to conviction. With it my reason had nothing to do.All attempts at logical inquiry resulted, indeed, in leaving me moresceptical than before. I had been advised to study Cousin. I studiedhim in his own works as well as in those of his European and Americanechoes. The 'Charles Elwood' of Mr. Brownson, for example, was placedin my hands. I read it with profound attention. Throughout I found itlogical, but the portions which were not _merely_ logical were unhappilythe initial arguments of the disbelieving hero of the book. In hissumming up it seemed evident to me that the reasoner had not evensucceeded in convincing himself. His end had plainly forgotten hisbeginning, like the government of Trinculo. In short, I was not long inperceiving that if man is to be intellectually convinced of his ownimmortality, he will never be so convinced by the mere abstractionswhich have been so long the fashion of the moralists of England, ofFrance, and of Germany. Abstractions may amuse and exercise, but take nohold on the mind. Here upon earth, at least, philosophy, I am persuaded,will always in vain call upon us to look upon qualities as things. Thewill may assent--the soul--the intellect, never. &quot;I repeat, then, that I only half felt, and never intellectuallybelieved. But latterly there has been a certain deepening of thefeeling, until it has come so nearly to resemble the acquiescence ofreason, that I find it difficult to distinguish between the two. I amenabled, too, plainly to trace this effect to the mesmeric influence.I cannot better explain my meaning than by the hypothesis that themesmeric exaltation enables me to perceive a train of ratiocinationwhich, in my abnormal existence, convinces, but which, in fullaccordance with the mesmeric phenomena, does not extend, except throughits _effect_, into my normal condition. In sleep-waking, the reasoningand its conclusion--the cause and its effect--are present together. Inmy natural state, the cause vanishing, the effect only, and perhaps onlypartially, remains. &quot;These considerations have led me to think that some goodresults might ensue from a series of well-directed questionspropounded to me while mesmerized. You have often observed the profoundself-cognizance evinced by the sleep-waker--the extensive knowledge hedisplays upon all points relating to the mesmeric condition itself; andfrom this self-cognizance may be deduced hints for the proper conduct ofa catechism.&quot; I consented of course to make this experiment.  A few passesthrew Mr. Vankirk into the mesmeric sleep. His breathing becameimmediately more easy, and he seemed to suffer no physical uneasiness.The following conversation then ensued:--V. in the dialogue representingthe patient, and P. myself._ P._ Are you asleep?_ V._ Yes--no I would rather sleep more soundly._P._ [_After a few more passes._] Do you sleep now?_V._ Yes._P._ How do you think your present illness will result?_V._ [_After a long hesitation and speaking as if with effort_.] I mustdie._P._ Does the idea of death afflict you?_V._ [_Very quickly_.] No--no!_P._ Are you pleased with the prospect?_V._ If I were awake I should like to die, but now it is no matter. Themesmeric condition is so near death as to content me._P._ I wish you would explain yourself, Mr. Vankirk._V._ I am willing to do so, but it requires more effort than I feel ableto make. You do not question me properly._P._ What then shall I ask?_V._ You must begin at the beginning._P._ The beginning! but where is the beginning?_V._ You know that the beginning is GOD. [_This was said in a low,fluctuating tone, and with every sign of the most profound veneration_.]_P._ What then is God?_V._ [_Hesitating for many minutes._] I cannot tell._P._ Is not God spirit?_V._ While I was awake I knew what you meant by &quot;spirit,&quot; but now itseems only a word--such for instance as truth, beauty--a quality, Imean._P._ Is not God immaterial?_V._ There is no immateriality--it is a mere word. That which is notmatter, is not at all--unless qualities are things._P._ Is God, then, material?_V._ No. [_This reply startled me very much._]_P._ What then is he?_V._ [_After a long pause, and mutteringly._] I see--but it is a thingdifficult to tell. [_Another long pause._] He is not spirit, forhe exists. Nor is he matter, as _you understand it_. But there are_gradations_ of matter of which man knows nothing; the grosser impellingthe finer, the finer pervading the grosser. The atmosphere, for example,impels the electric principle, while the electric principle permeatesthe atmosphere. These gradations of matter increase in rarityor fineness, until we arrive at a matter _unparticled_--withoutparticles--indivisible--_one_ and here the law of impulsion andpermeation is modified. The ultimate, or unparticled matter, not onlypermeates all things but impels all things--and thus _is_ all thingswithin itself. This matter is God. What men attempt to embody in theword &quot;thought,&quot; is this matter in motion._P._ The metaphysicians maintain that all action is reducible to motionand thinking, and that the latter is the origin of the former._V._ Yes; and I now see the confusion of idea. Motion is the actionof _mind_--not of _thinking_. The unparticled matter, or God, inquiescence, is (as nearly as we can conceive it) what men call mind. Andthe power of self-movement (equivalent in effect to human volition) is,in the unparticled matter, the result of its unity and omniprevalence;_how_ I know not, and now clearly see that I shall never know. But theunparticled matter, set in motion by a law, or quality, existing withinitself, is thinking._P._ Can you give me no more precise idea of what you term theunparticled matter?_V._ The matters of which man is cognizant, escape the senses ingradation. We have, for example, a metal, a piece of wood, a drop ofwater, the atmosphere, a gas, caloric, electricity, the luminiferousether. Now we call all these things matter, and embrace all matter inone general definition; but in spite of this, there can be no two ideasmore essentially distinct than that which we attach to a metal, and thatwhich we attach to the luminiferous ether. When we reach the latter, wefeel an almost irresistible inclination to class it with spirit, or withnihility. The only consideration which restrains us is our conceptionof its atomic constitution; and here, even, we have to seek aid fromour notion of an atom, as something possessing in infinite minuteness,solidity, palpability, weight. Destroy the idea of the atomicconstitution and we should no longer be able to regard the ether as anentity, or at least as matter. For want of a better word we might termit spirit. Take, now, a step beyond the luminiferous ether--conceive amatter as much more rare than the ether, as this ether is more rare thanthe metal, and we arrive at once (in spite of all the school dogmas) ata unique mass--an unparticled matter. For although we may admit infinitelittleness in the atoms themselves, the infinitude of littleness in thespaces between them is an absurdity. There will be a point--there willbe a degree of rarity, at which, if the atoms are sufficiently numerous,the interspaces must vanish, and the mass absolutely coalesce. Butthe consideration of the atomic constitution being now taken away, thenature of the mass inevitably glides into what we conceive of spirit. Itis clear, however, that it is as fully matter as before. The truth is,it is impossible to conceive spirit, since it is impossible toimagine what is not. When we flatter ourselves that we have formedits conception, we have merely deceived our understanding by theconsideration of infinitely rarified matter._P._ There seems to me an insurmountable objection to the ideaof absolute coalescence;--and that is the very slight resistanceexperienced by the heavenly bodies in their revolutions through space--aresistance now ascertained, it is true, to exist in _some_ degree, butwhich is, nevertheless, so slight as to have been quite overlooked bythe sagacity even of Newton. We know that the resistance of bodiesis, chiefly, in proportion to their density. Absolute coalescenceis absolute density. Where there are no interspaces, there can be noyielding. An ether, absolutely dense, would put an infinitely moreeffectual stop to the progress of a star than would an ether of adamantor of iron._V._ Your objection is answered with an ease which is nearly in theratio of its apparent unanswerability.--As regards the progress of thestar, it can make no difference whether the star passes through theether _or the ether through it_. There is no astronomical error moreunaccountable than that which reconciles the known retardation of thecomets with the idea of their passage through an ether: for, howeverrare this ether be supposed, it would put a stop to all siderealrevolution in a very far briefer period than has been admitted by thoseastronomers who have endeavored to slur over a point which they foundit impossible to comprehend. The retardation actually experienced is, onthe other hand, about that which might be expected from the _friction_of the ether in the instantaneous passage through the orb. In the onecase, the retarding force is momentary and complete within itself--inthe other it is endlessly accumulative._P._ But in all this--in this identification of mere matter with God--isthere nothing of irreverence? [_I was forced to repeat this questionbefore the sleep-waker fully comprehended my meaning_.]_V._ Can you say _why_ matter should be less reverenced than mind? Butyou forget that the matter of which I speak is, in all respects, thevery &quot;mind&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot; of the schools, so far as regards its highcapacities, and is, moreover, the &quot;matter&quot; of these schools at thesame time. God, with all the powers attributed to spirit, is but theperfection of matter._P._ You assert, then, that the unparticled matter, in motion, isthought?_V._ In general, this motion is the universal thought of the universalmind. This thought creates. All created things are but the thoughts ofGod._P._ You say, &quot;in general.&quot;_V._ Yes. The universal mind is God. For new individualities, _matter_is necessary._P._ But you now speak of &quot;mind&quot; and &quot;matter&quot; as do the metaphysicians._V._ Yes--to avoid confusion. When I say &quot;mind,&quot; I mean the unparticledor ultimate matter; by &quot;matter,&quot; I intend all else._P._ You were saying that &quot;for new individualities matter is necessary.&quot;_V._ Yes; for mind, existing unincorporate, is merely God. To createindividual, thinking beings, it was necessary to incarnate portionsof the divine mind. Thus man is individualized. Divested of corporateinvestiture, he were God. Now, the particular motion of the incarnatedportions of the unparticled matter is the thought of man; as the motionof the whole is that of God._P._ You say that divested of the body man will be God?_V._ [_After much hesitation._] I could not have said this; it is anabsurdity._P._ [_Referring to my notes._] You _did_ say that &quot;divested ofcorporate investiture man were God.&quot;_V._ And this is true. Man thus divested _would be_ God--would beunindividualized. But he can never be thus divested--at least never_will be_--else we must imagine an action of God returning uponitself--a purposeless and futile action. Man is a creature. Creaturesare thoughts of God. It is the nature of thought to be irrevocable._P._ I do not comprehend. You say that man will never put off the body?_V._ I say that he will never be bodiless._P._ Explain._V._ There are two bodies--the rudimental and the complete;corresponding with the two conditions of the worm and the butterfly.What we call &quot;death,&quot; is but the painful metamorphosis. Our presentincarnation is progressive, preparatory, temporary. Our future isperfected, ultimate, immortal. The ultimate life is the full design._P._ But of the worm's metamorphosis we are palpably cognizant._V._ _We_, certainly--but not the worm. The matter of which ourrudimental body is composed, is within the ken of the organs of thatbody; or, more distinctly, our rudimental organs are adapted to thematter of which is formed the rudimental body; but not to that of whichthe ultimate is composed. The ultimate body thus escapes our rudimentalsenses, and we perceive only the shell which falls, in decaying, fromthe inner form; not that inner form itself; but this inner form, aswell as the shell, is appreciable by those who have already acquired theultimate life._P._ You have often said that the mesmeric state very nearly resemblesdeath. How is this?_V._ When I say that it resembles death, I mean that it resembles theultimate life; for when I am entranced the senses of my rudimentallife are in abeyance, and I perceive external things directly,without organs, through a medium which I shall employ in the ultimate,unorganized life._P._ Unorganized?_V._ Yes; organs are contrivances by which the individual is broughtinto sensible relation with particular classes and forms of matter, tothe exclusion of other classes and forms. The organs of man are adaptedto his rudimental condition, and to that only; his ultimate condition,being unorganized, is of unlimited comprehension in all points butone--the nature of the volition of God--that is to say, the motion ofthe unparticled matter. You will have a distinct idea of the ultimatebody by conceiving it to be entire brain. This it is _not_; but aconception of this nature will bring you near a comprehension of what it_is_. A luminous body imparts vibration to the luminiferous ether.The vibrations generate similar ones within the retina; these againcommunicate similar ones to the optic nerve. The nerve conveys similarones to the brain; the brain, also, similar ones to the unparticledmatter which permeates it. The motion of this latter is thought, ofwhich perception is the first undulation. This is the mode by which themind of the rudimental life communicates with the external world; andthis external world is, to the rudimental life, limited, through theidiosyncrasy of its organs. But in the ultimate, unorganized life, theexternal world reaches the whole body, (which is of a substance havingaffinity to brain, as I have said,) with no other intervention than thatof an infinitely rarer ether than even the luminiferous; and to thisether--in unison with it--the whole body vibrates, setting in motionthe unparticled matter which permeates it. It is to the absence ofidiosyncratic organs, therefore, that we must attribute the nearlyunlimited perception of the ultimate life. To rudimental beings, organsare the cages necessary to confine them until fledged._P._ You speak of rudimental &quot;beings.&quot; Are there other rudimentalthinking beings than man?_V._ The multitudinous conglomeration of rare matter into nebulÃ¦,planets, suns, and other bodies which are neither nebulÃ¦, suns,nor planets, is for the sole purpose of supplying _pabulum_ for theidiosyncrasy of the organs of an infinity of rudimental beings. But forthe necessity of the rudimental, prior to the ultimate life, therewould have been no bodies such as these. Each of these is tenanted by adistinct variety of organic, rudimental, thinking creatures. In all,the organs vary with the features of the place tenanted. At death,or metamorphosis, these creatures, enjoying the ultimatelife--immortality--and cognizant of all secrets but _the one_, act allthings and pass everywhere by mere volition:--indwelling, not the stars,which to us seem the sole palpabilities, and for the accommodationof which we blindly deem space created--but that SPACE itself--thatinfinity of which the truly substantive vastness swallows up thestar-shadows--blotting them out as non-entities from the perception ofthe angels._P._ You say that &quot;but for the _necessity_ of the rudimental life&quot; therewould have been no stars. But why this necessity?_V._ In the inorganic life, as well as in the inorganic mattergenerally, there is nothing to impede the action of one simple _unique_law--the Divine Volition. With the view of producing impediment, theorganic life and matter, (complex, substantial, and law-encumbered,)were contrived._P._ But again--why need this impediment have been produced?_V._ The result of law inviolate is perfection--right--negativehappiness. The result of law violate is imperfection, wrong, positivepain. Through the impediments afforded by the number, complexity, andsubstantiality of the laws of organic life and matter, the violation oflaw is rendered, to a certain extent, practicable. Thus pain, which inthe inorganic life is impossible, is possible in the organic._P._ But to what good end is pain thus rendered possible?_V._ All things are either good or bad by comparison. A sufficientanalysis will show that pleasure, in all cases, is but the contrast ofpain. _Positive_ pleasure is a mere idea. To be happy at any one pointwe must have suffered at the same. Never to suffer would have been neverto have been blessed. But it has been shown that, in the inorganiclife, pain cannot be thus the necessity for the organic. The pain of theprimitive life of Earth, is the sole basis of the bliss of the ultimatelife in Heaven._P._ Still, there is one of your expressions which I find it impossibleto comprehend--&quot;the truly _substantive_ vastness of infinity.&quot;_V._ This, probably, is because you have no sufficiently genericconception of the term &quot;_substance_&quot; itself. We must not regard it as aquality, but as a sentiment:--it is the perception, in thinking beings,of the adaptation of matter to their organization. There are many thingson the Earth, which would be nihility to the inhabitants of Venus--manythings visible and tangible in Venus, which we could not be broughtto appreciate as existing at all. But to the inorganic beings--to theangels--the whole of the unparticled matter is substance--that isto say, the whole of what we term &quot;space&quot; is to them the truestsubstantiality;--the stars, meantime, through what we consider theirmateriality, escaping the angelic sense, just in proportion as theunparticled matter, through what we consider its immateriality, eludesthe organic.  As the sleep-waker pronounced these latter words, in a feeble tone,I observed on his countenance a singular expression, which somewhatalarmed me, and induced me to awake him at once. No sooner had I donethis, than, with a bright smile irradiating all his features, he fellback upon his pillow and expired. I noticed that in less than a minuteafterward his corpse had all the stern rigidity of stone. His brow wasof the coldness of ice. Thus, ordinarily, should it have appeared, onlyafter long pressure from Azrael's hand. Had the sleep-waker, indeed,during the latter portion of his discourse, been addressing me from outthe region of the shadows?THE FACTS IN THE CASE OF M. VALDEMAROF course I shall not pretend to consider it any matter for wonder, thatthe extraordinary case of M. Valdemar has excited discussion. It wouldhave been a miracle had it not-especially under the circumstances.Through the desire of all parties concerned, to keep the affair from thepublic, at least for the present, or until we had farther opportunitiesfor investigation--through our endeavors to effect this--a garbled orexaggerated account made its way into society, and became the source ofmany unpleasant misrepresentations, and, very naturally, of a great dealof disbelief.It is now rendered necessary that I give the facts--as far as Icomprehend them myself. They are, succinctly, these:My attention, for the last three years, had been repeatedly drawn tothe subject of Mesmerism; and, about nine months ago it occurred to me,quite suddenly, that in the series of experiments made hitherto, therehad been a very remarkable and most unaccountable omission:--no personhad as yet been mesmerized in articulo mortis. It remained to be seen,first, whether, in such condition, there existed in the patient anysusceptibility to the magnetic influence; secondly, whether, if anyexisted, it was impaired or increased by the condition; thirdly, to whatextent, or for how long a period, the encroachments of Death might bearrested by the process. There were other points to be ascertained,but these most excited my curiosity--the last in especial, from theimmensely important character of its consequences.In looking around me for some subject by whose means I might test theseparticulars, I was brought to think of my friend, M. Ernest Valdemar,the well-known compiler of the &quot;Bibliotheca Forensica,&quot; and author(under the nom de plume of Issachar Marx) of the Polish versions of&quot;Wallenstein&quot; and &quot;Gargantua.&quot; M. Valdemar, who has resided principallyat Harlaem, N.Y., since the year 1839, is (or was) particularlynoticeable for the extreme spareness of his person--his lower limbs muchresembling those of John Randolph; and, also, for the whiteness of hiswhiskers, in violent contrast to the blackness of his hair--the latter,in consequence, being very generally mistaken for a wig. His temperamentwas markedly nervous, and rendered him a good subject for mesmericexperiment. On two or three occasions I had put him to sleep with littledifficulty, but was disappointed in other results which his peculiarconstitution had naturally led me to anticipate. His will was at noperiod positively, or thoroughly, under my control, and in regard toclairvoyance, I could accomplish with him nothing to be relied upon. Ialways attributed my failure at these points to the disordered state ofhis health. For some months previous to my becoming acquainted withhim, his physicians had declared him in a confirmed phthisis. It was hiscustom, indeed, to speak calmly of his approaching dissolution, as of amatter neither to be avoided nor regretted.When the ideas to which I have alluded first occurred to me, it wasof course very natural that I should think of M. Valdemar. I knew thesteady philosophy of the man too well to apprehend any scruplesfrom him; and he had no relatives in America who would be likely tointerfere. I spoke to him frankly upon the subject; and, to my surprise,his interest seemed vividly excited. I say to my surprise, for, althoughhe had always yielded his person freely to my experiments, he had neverbefore given me any tokens of sympathy with what I did. His disease wasof that character which would admit of exact calculation in respectto the epoch of its termination in death; and it was finally arrangedbetween us that he would send for me about twenty-four hours before theperiod announced by his physicians as that of his decease.It is now rather more than seven months since I received, from M.Valdemar himself, the subjoined note:My DEAR P---,You may as well come now. D---- and F---- are agreed that I cannot hold outbeyond to-morrow midnight; and I think they have hit the time verynearly.VALDEMARI received this note within half an hour after it was written, and infifteen minutes more I was in the dying man's chamber. I had not seenhim for ten days, and was appalled by the fearful alteration which thebrief interval had wrought in him. His face wore a leaden hue; the eyeswere utterly lustreless; and the emaciation was so extreme that theskin had been broken through by the cheek-bones. His expectoration wasexcessive. The pulse was barely perceptible. He retained, nevertheless,in a very remarkable manner, both his mental power and a certain degreeof physical strength. He spoke with distinctness--took some palliativemedicines without aid--and, when I entered the room, was occupied inpenciling memoranda in a pocket-book. He was propped up in the bed bypillows. Doctors D---- and F---- were in attendance.After pressing Valdemar's hand, I took these gentlemen aside, andobtained from them a minute account of the patient's condition. The leftlung had been for eighteen months in a semi-osseous or cartilaginousstate, and was, of course, entirely useless for all purposes ofvitality. The right, in its upper portion, was also partially, ifnot thoroughly, ossified, while the lower region was merely a massof purulent tubercles, running one into another. Several extensiveperforations existed; and, at one point, permanent adhesion to theribs had taken place. These appearances in the right lobe were ofcomparatively recent date. The ossification had proceeded with veryunusual rapidity; no sign of it had been discovered a month before, andthe adhesion had only been observed during the three previous days.Independently of the phthisis, the patient was suspected of aneurismof the aorta; but on this point the osseous symptoms rendered an exactdiagnosis impossible. It was the opinion of both physicians that M.Valdemar would die about midnight on the morrow (Sunday). It was thenseven o'clock on Saturday evening.On quitting the invalid's bed-side to hold conversation with myself,Doctors D---- and F---- had bidden him a final farewell. It had not been theirintention to return; but, at my request, they agreed to look in upon thepatient about ten the next night.When they had gone, I spoke freely with M. Valdemar on the subjectof his approaching dissolution, as well as, more particularly, of theexperiment proposed. He still professed himself quite willing and evenanxious to have it made, and urged me to commence it at once. A male anda female nurse were in attendance; but I did not feel myself altogetherat liberty to engage in a task of this character with no more reliablewitnesses than these people, in case of sudden accident, might prove.I therefore postponed operations until about eight the next night, whenthe arrival of a medical student with whom I had some acquaintance, (Mr.Theodore L--l,) relieved me from farther embarrassment. It had been mydesign, originally, to wait for the physicians; but I was induced toproceed, first, by the urgent entreaties of M. Valdemar, and secondly,by my conviction that I had not a moment to lose, as he was evidentlysinking fast.Mr. L--l was so kind as to accede to my desire that he would take notesof all that occurred, and it is from his memoranda that what I now haveto relate is, for the most part, either condensed or copied verbatim.It wanted about five minutes of eight when, taking the patient's hand, Ibegged him to state, as distinctly as he could, to Mr. L--l, whether he(M. Valdemar) was entirely willing that I should make the experiment ofmesmerizing him in his then condition.He replied feebly, yet quite audibly, &quot;Yes, I wish to be. I fear youhave mesmerized&quot;--adding immediately afterwards, &quot;deferred it too long.&quot;While he spoke thus, I commenced the passes which I had already foundmost effectual in subduing him. He was evidently influenced with thefirst lateral stroke of my hand across his forehead; but although Iexerted all my powers, no further perceptible effect was induceduntil some minutes after ten o'clock, when Doctors D-- and F-- called,according to appointment. I explained to them, in a few words, what Idesigned, and as they opposed no objection, saying that the patient wasalready in the death agony, I proceeded without hesitation--exchanging,however, the lateral passes for downward ones, and directing my gazeentirely into the right eye of the sufferer.By this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing wasstertorous, and at intervals of half a minute.This condition was nearly unaltered for a quarter of an hour. At theexpiration of this period, however, a natural although a very deepsigh escaped the bosom of the dying man, and the stertorous breathingceased--that is to say, its stertorousness was no longer apparent; theintervals were undiminished. The patient's extremities were of an icycoldness.At five minutes before eleven I perceived unequivocal signs of themesmeric influence. The glassy roll of the eye was changed for thatexpression of uneasy inward examination which is never seen except incases of sleep-waking, and which it is quite impossible to mistake.With a few rapid lateral passes I made the lids quiver, as in incipientsleep, and with a few more I closed them altogether. I was notsatisfied, however, with this, but continued the manipulationsvigorously, and with the fullest exertion of the will, until I hadcompletely stiffened the limbs of the slumberer, after placing them ina seemingly easy position. The legs were at full length; the arms werenearly so, and reposed on the bed at a moderate distance from the loin.The head was very slightly elevated.When I had accomplished this, it was fully midnight, and I requestedthe gentlemen present to examine M. Valdemar's condition. After a fewexperiments, they admitted him to be an unusually perfect state ofmesmeric trance. The curiosity of both the physicians was greatlyexcited. Dr. D---- resolved at once to remain with the patient allnight, while Dr. F---- took leave with a promise to return at daybreak.Mr. L--l and the nurses remained.We left M. Valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three o'clock inthe morning, when I approached him and found him in precisely the samecondition as when Dr. F--went away--that is to say, he lay in thesame position; the pulse was imperceptible; the breathing was gentle(scarcely noticeable, unless through the application of a mirror to thelips); the eyes were closed naturally; and the limbs were as rigid andas cold as marble. Still, the general appearance was certainly not thatof death.As I approached M. Valdemar I made a kind of half effort to influencehis right arm into pursuit of my own, as I passed the latter gentlyto and fro above his person. In such experiments with this patient I hadnever perfectly succeeded before, and assuredly I had little thought ofsucceeding now; but to my astonishment, his arm very readily, althoughfeebly, followed every direction I assigned it with mine. I determinedto hazard a few words of conversation.&quot;M. Valdemar,&quot; I said, &quot;are you asleep?&quot; He made no answer, but Iperceived a tremor about the lips, and was thus induced to repeat thequestion, again and again. At its third repetition, his whole frame wasagitated by a very slight shivering; the eyelids unclosed themselves sofar as to display a white line of the ball; the lips moved sluggishly,and from between them, in a barely audible whisper, issued the words:&quot;Yes;--asleep now. Do not wake me!--let me die so!&quot;I here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever. The right arm,as before, obeyed the direction of my hand. I questioned the sleep-wakeragain:&quot;Do you still feel pain in the breast, M. Valdemar?&quot;The answer now was immediate, but even less audible than before: &quot;Nopain--I am dying.&quot;I did not think it advisable to disturb him farther just then, andnothing more was said or done until the arrival of Dr. F--, who came alittle before sunrise, and expressed unbounded astonishment at findingthe patient still alive. After feeling the pulse and applying a mirrorto the lips, he requested me to speak to the sleep-waker again. I didso, saying:&quot;M. Valdemar, do you still sleep?&quot;As before, some minutes elapsed ere a reply was made; and during theinterval the dying man seemed to be collecting his energies to speak.At my fourth repetition of the question, he said very faintly, almostinaudibly:&quot;Yes; still asleep--dying.&quot;It was now the opinion, or rather the wish, of the physicians, thatM. Valdemar should be suffered to remain undisturbed in his presentapparently tranquil condition, until death should supervene--and this,it was generally agreed, must now take place within a few minutes. Iconcluded, however, to speak to him once more, and merely repeated myprevious question.While I spoke, there came a marked change over the countenance ofthe sleep-waker. The eyes rolled themselves slowly open, the pupilsdisappearing upwardly; the skin generally assumed a cadaverous hue,resembling not so much parchment as white paper; and the circular hecticspots which, hitherto, had been strongly defined in the centre of eachcheek, went out at once. I use this expression, because thesuddenness of their departure put me in mind of nothing so much as theextinguishment of a candle by a puff of the breath. The upper lip,at the same time, writhed itself away from the teeth, which it hadpreviously covered completely; while the lower jaw fell with an audiblejerk, leaving the mouth widely extended, and disclosing in full view theswollen and blackened tongue. I presume that no member of the partythen present had been unaccustomed to death-bed horrors; but so hideousbeyond conception was the appearance of M. Valdemar at this moment, thatthere was a general shrinking back from the region of the bed.I now feel that I have reached a point of this narrative at which everyreader will be startled into positive disbelief. It is my business,however, simply to proceed.There was no longer the faintest sign of vitality in M. Valdemar; andconcluding him to be dead, we were consigning him to the charge of thenurses, when a strong vibratory motion was observable in the tongue.This continued for perhaps a minute. At the expiration of this period,there issued from the distended and motionless jaws a voice--such as itwould be madness in me to attempt describing. There are, indeed, two orthree epithets which might be considered as applicable to it in part; Imight say, for example, that the sound was harsh, and broken and hollow;but the hideous whole is indescribable, for the simple reason that nosimilar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of humanity. There were twoparticulars, nevertheless, which I thought then, and still think, mightfairly be stated as characteristic of the intonation--as well adapted toconvey some idea of its unearthly peculiarity. In the first place, thevoice seemed to reach our ears--at least mine--from a vast distance,or from some deep cavern within the earth. In the second place, itimpressed me (I fear, indeed, that it will be impossible to make myselfcomprehended) as gelatinous or glutinous matters impress the sense oftouch.I have spoken both of &quot;sound&quot; and of &quot;voice.&quot; I mean to say thatthe sound was one of distinct--of even wonderfully, thrillinglydistinct--syllabification. M. Valdemar spoke--obviously in reply to thequestion I had propounded to him a few minutes before. I had asked him,it will be remembered, if he still slept. He now said:&quot;Yes;--no;--I have been sleeping--and now--now--I am dead.&quot;No person present even affected to deny, or attempted to repress, theunutterable, shuddering horror which these few words, thus uttered, wereso well calculated to convey. Mr. L--l (the student) swooned. The nursesimmediately left the chamber, and could not be induced to return. My ownimpressions I would not pretend to render intelligible to the reader.For nearly an hour, we busied ourselves, silently--without the utteranceof a word--in endeavors to revive Mr. L--l. When he came to himself,we addressed ourselves again to an investigation of M. Valdemar'scondition.It remained in all respects as I have last described it, with theexception that the mirror no longer afforded evidence of respiration. Anattempt to draw blood from the arm failed. I should mention, too, thatthis limb was no farther subject to my will. I endeavored in vain tomake it follow the direction of my hand. The only real indication,indeed, of the mesmeric influence, was now found in the vibratorymovement of the tongue, whenever I addressed M. Valdemar a question.He seemed to be making an effort to reply, but had no longer sufficientvolition. To queries put to him by any other person than myself heseemed utterly insensible--although I endeavored to place each memberof the company in mesmeric rapport with him. I believe that I have nowrelated all that is necessary to an understanding of the sleep-waker'sstate at this epoch. Other nurses were procured; and at ten o'clock Ileft the house in company with the two physicians and Mr. L--l.In the afternoon we all called again to see the patient. His conditionremained precisely the same. We had now some discussion as to thepropriety and feasibility of awakening him; but we had little difficultyin agreeing that no good purpose would be served by so doing. It wasevident that, so far, death (or what is usually termed death) had beenarrested by the mesmeric process. It seemed clear to us all that toawaken M. Valdemar would be merely to insure his instant, or at leasthis speedy dissolution.From this period until the close of last week--an interval of nearlyseven months--we continued to make daily calls at M. Valdemar's house,accompanied, now and then, by medical and other friends. All this timethe sleeper-waker remained exactly as I have last described him. Thenurses' attentions were continual.It was on Friday last that we finally resolved to make the experimentof awakening or attempting to awaken him; and it is the (perhaps)unfortunate result of this latter experiment which has given rise toso much discussion in private circles--to so much of what I cannot helpthinking unwarranted popular feeling.For the purpose of relieving M. Valdemar from the mesmeric trance, Imade use of the customary passes. These, for a time, were unsuccessful.The first indication of revival was afforded by a partial descent of theiris. It was observed, as especially remarkable, that this loweringof the pupil was accompanied by the profuse out-flowing of a yellowishichor (from beneath the lids) of a pungent and highly offensive odor.It was now suggested that I should attempt to influence the patient'sarm, as heretofore. I made the attempt and failed. Dr. F--then intimateda desire to have me put a question. I did so, as follows:&quot;M. Valdemar, can you explain to us what are your feelings or wishesnow?&quot;There was an instant return of the hectic circles on the cheeks; thetongue quivered, or rather rolled violently in the mouth (although thejaws and lips remained rigid as before;) and at length the same hideousvoice which I have already described, broke forth:&quot;For God's sake!--quick!--quick!--put me to sleep--or, quick!--wakenme!--quick!--I say to you that I am dead!&quot;I was thoroughly unnerved, and for an instant remained undecided what todo. At first I made an endeavor to re-compose the patient; but, failingin this through total abeyance of the will, I retraced my steps and asearnestly struggled to awaken him. In this attempt I soon saw that Ishould be successful--or at least I soon fancied that my success wouldbe complete--and I am sure that all in the room were prepared to see thepatient awaken.For what really occurred, however, it is quite impossible that any humanbeing could have been prepared.As I rapidly made the mesmeric passes, amid ejaculations of &quot;dead!dead!&quot; absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from the lips of thesufferer, his whole frame at once--within the space of a single minute,or even less, shrunk--crumbled--absolutely rotted away beneath my hands.Upon the bed, before that whole company, there lay a nearly liquid massof loathsome--of detestable putridity.THE BLACK CAT.FOR the most wild, yet most homely narrative which I am about to pen, Ineither expect nor solicit belief. Mad indeed would I be to expect it,in a case where my very senses reject their own evidence. Yet, mad am Inot--and very surely do I not dream. But to-morrow I die, and to-dayI would unburthen my soul. My immediate purpose is to place beforethe world, plainly, succinctly, and without comment, a series ofmere household events. In their consequences, these events haveterrified--have tortured--have destroyed me. Yet I will not attempt toexpound them. To me, they have presented little but Horror--to manythey will seem less terrible than _barroques_. Hereafter, perhaps,some intellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to thecommon-place--some intellect more calm, more logical, and far lessexcitable than my own, which will perceive, in the circumstances Idetail with awe, nothing more than an ordinary succession of verynatural causes and effects.From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of mydisposition. My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to makeme the jest of my companions. I was especially fond of animals, and wasindulged by my parents with a great variety of pets. With these I spentmost of my time, and never was so happy as when feeding and caressingthem. This peculiarity of character grew with my growth, and in mymanhood, I derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure. Tothose who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagaciousdog, I need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or theintensity of the gratification thus derivable. There is something in theunselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directlyto the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltryfriendship and gossamer fidelity of mere _Man_.I married early, and was happy to find in my wife a disposition notuncongenial with my own. Observing my partiality for domestic pets, shelost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable kind. Wehad birds, gold-fish, a fine dog, rabbits, a small monkey, and _a cat_.This latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal, entirely black,and sagacious to an astonishing degree. In speaking of his intelligence,my wife, who at heart was not a little tinctured with superstition,made frequent allusion to the ancient popular notion, which regarded allblack cats as witches in disguise. Not that she was ever _serious_ uponthis point--and I mention the matter at all for no better reason thanthat it happens, just now, to be remembered.Pluto--this was the cat's name--was my favorite pet and playmate. Ialone fed him, and he attended me wherever I went about the house. Itwas even with difficulty that I could prevent him from following methrough the streets.Our friendship lasted, in this manner, for several years, during whichmy general temperament and character--through the instrumentality of theFiend Intemperance--had (I blush to confess it) experienced a radicalalteration for the worse. I grew, day by day, more moody, moreirritable, more regardless of the feelings of others. I suffered myselfto use intemperate language to my wife. At length, I even offered herpersonal violence. My pets, of course, were made to feel the changein my disposition. I not only neglected, but ill-used them. ForPluto, however, I still retained sufficient regard to restrain me frommaltreating him, as I made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits, themonkey, or even the dog, when by accident, or through affection, theycame in my way. But my disease grew upon me--for what disease is likeAlcohol!--and at length even Pluto, who was now becoming old, andconsequently somewhat peevish--even Pluto began to experience theeffects of my ill temper.One night, returning home, much intoxicated, from one of my haunts abouttown, I fancied that the cat avoided my presence. I seized him; when, inhis fright at my violence, he inflicted a slight wound upon my hand withhis teeth. The fury of a demon instantly possessed me. I knew myselfno longer. My original soul seemed, at once, to take its flight from mybody and a more than fiendish malevolence, gin-nurtured, thrilled everyfibre of my frame. I took from my waistcoat-pocket a pen-knife, openedit, grasped the poor beast by the throat, and deliberately cut one ofits eyes from the socket! I blush, I burn, I shudder, while I pen thedamnable atrocity.When reason returned with the morning--when I had slept off the fumes ofthe night's debauch--I experienced a sentiment half of horror, half ofremorse, for the crime of which I had been guilty; but it was, at best,a feeble and equivocal feeling, and the soul remained untouched. I againplunged into excess, and soon drowned in wine all memory of the deed.In the meantime the cat slowly recovered. The socket of the lost eyepresented, it is true, a frightful appearance, but he no longer appearedto suffer any pain. He went about the house as usual, but, as might beexpected, fled in extreme terror at my approach. I had so much of myold heart left, as to be at first grieved by this evident dislike onthe part of a creature which had once so loved me. But this feelingsoon gave place to irritation. And then came, as if to my final andirrevocable overthrow, the spirit of PERVERSENESS. Of this spiritphilosophy takes no account. Yet I am not more sure that my soul lives,than I am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of thehuman heart--one of the indivisible primary faculties, or sentiments,which give direction to the character of Man. Who has not, a hundredtimes, found himself committing a vile or a silly action, for no otherreason than because he knows he should not? Have we not a perpetualinclination, in the teeth of our best judgment, to violate that whichis _Law_, merely because we understand it to be such? This spiritof perverseness, I say, came to my final overthrow. It was thisunfathomable longing of the soul _to vex itself_--to offer violence toits own nature--to do wrong for the wrong's sake only--that urged me tocontinue and finally to consummate the injury I had inflicted upon theunoffending brute. One morning, in cool blood, I slipped a noose aboutits neck and hung it to the limb of a tree;--hung it with thetears streaming from my eyes, and with the bitterest remorse at myheart;--hung it _because_ I knew that it had loved me, and _because_I felt it had given me no reason of offence;--hung it _because_ I knewthat in so doing I was committing a sin--a deadly sin that wouldso jeopardize my immortal soul as to place it--if such a thing worepossible--even beyond the reach of the infinite mercy of the MostMerciful and Most Terrible God.On the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done, I was arousedfrom sleep by the cry of fire. The curtains of my bed were in flames.The whole house was blazing. It was with great difficulty that my wife,a servant, and myself, made our escape from the conflagration. Thedestruction was complete. My entire worldly wealth was swallowed up, andI resigned myself thenceforward to despair.I am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of causeand effect, between the disaster and the atrocity. But I am detailing achain of facts--and wish not to leave even a possible link imperfect.On the day succeeding the fire, I visited the ruins. The walls, withone exception, had fallen in. This exception was found in a compartmentwall, not very thick, which stood about the middle of the house, andagainst which had rested the head of my bed. The plastering had here,in great measure, resisted the action of the fire--a fact which Iattributed to its having been recently spread. About this wall adense crowd were collected, and many persons seemed to be examining aparticular portion of it with very minute and eager attention. Thewords &quot;strange!&quot; &quot;singular!&quot; and other similar expressions, excited mycuriosity. I approached and saw, as if graven in _bas relief_ upon thewhite surface, the figure of a gigantic _cat_. The impression was givenwith an accuracy truly marvellous. There was a rope about the animal'sneck.When I first beheld this apparition--for I could scarcely regard it asless--my wonder and my terror were extreme. But at length reflectioncame to my aid. The cat, I remembered, had been hung in a gardenadjacent to the house. Upon the alarm of fire, this garden had beenimmediately filled by the crowd--by some one of whom the animal musthave been cut from the tree and thrown, through an open window, into mychamber. This had probably been done with the view of arousing mefrom sleep. The falling of other walls had compressed the victim of mycruelty into the substance of the freshly-spread plaster; the lime ofwhich, with the flames, and the _ammonia_ from the carcass, had thenaccomplished the portraiture as I saw it.Although I thus readily accounted to my reason, if not altogether to myconscience, for the startling fact just detailed, it did not the lessfail to make a deep impression upon my fancy. For months I could not ridmyself of the phantasm of the cat; and, during this period, there cameback into my spirit a half-sentiment that seemed, but was not, remorse.I went so far as to regret the loss of the animal, and to look about me,among the vile haunts which I now habitually frequented, for another petof the same species, and of somewhat similar appearance, with which tosupply its place.One night as I sat, half stupified, in a den of more than infamy, myattention was suddenly drawn to some black object, reposing uponthe head of one of the immense hogsheads of Gin, or of Rum, whichconstituted the chief furniture of the apartment. I had been lookingsteadily at the top of this hogshead for some minutes, and what nowcaused me surprise was the fact that I had not sooner perceived theobject thereupon. I approached it, and touched it with my hand. It wasa black cat--a very large one--fully as large as Pluto, and closelyresembling him in every respect but one. Pluto had not a white hair uponany portion of his body; but this cat had a large, although indefinitesplotch of white, covering nearly the whole region of the breast. Uponmy touching him, he immediately arose, purred loudly, rubbed against myhand, and appeared delighted with my notice. This, then, was the verycreature of which I was in search. I at once offered to purchase itof the landlord; but this person made no claim to it--knew nothing ofit--had never seen it before.I continued my caresses, and, when I prepared to go home, the animalevinced a disposition to accompany me. I permitted it to do so;occasionally stooping and patting it as I proceeded. When it reachedthe house it domesticated itself at once, and became immediately a greatfavorite with my wife.For my own part, I soon found a dislike to it arising within me. Thiswas just the reverse of what I had anticipated; but--I know not howor why it was--its evident fondness for myself rather disgusted andannoyed. By slow degrees, these feelings of disgust and annoyance roseinto the bitterness of hatred. I avoided the creature; a certain senseof shame, and the remembrance of my former deed of cruelty, preventingme from physically abusing it. I did not, for some weeks, strike, orotherwise violently ill use it; but gradually--very gradually--I cameto look upon it with unutterable loathing, and to flee silently from itsodious presence, as from the breath of a pestilence.What added, no doubt, to my hatred of the beast, was the discovery, onthe morning after I brought it home, that, like Pluto, it also had beendeprived of one of its eyes. This circumstance, however, only endearedit to my wife, who, as I have already said, possessed, in a high degree,that humanity of feeling which had once been my distinguishing trait,and the source of many of my simplest and purest pleasures.With my aversion to this cat, however, its partiality for myself seemedto increase. It followed my footsteps with a pertinacity which it wouldbe difficult to make the reader comprehend. Whenever I sat, it wouldcrouch beneath my chair, or spring upon my knees, covering me with itsloathsome caresses. If I arose to walk it would get between my feet andthus nearly throw me down, or, fastening its long and sharp claws in mydress, clamber, in this manner, to my breast. At such times, althoughI longed to destroy it with a blow, I was yet withheld from so doing,partly by a memory of my former crime, but chiefly--let me confess it atonce--by absolute dread of the beast.This dread was not exactly a dread of physical evil--and yet I should beat a loss how otherwise to define it. I am almost ashamed to own--yes,even in this felon's cell, I am almost ashamed to own--that the terrorand horror with which the animal inspired me, had been heightened by oneof the merest chimaeras it would be possible to conceive. My wife hadcalled my attention, more than once, to the character of the mark ofwhite hair, of which I have spoken, and which constituted the solevisible difference between the strange beast and the one I haddestroyed. The reader will remember that this mark, although large, hadbeen originally very indefinite; but, by slow degrees--degrees nearlyimperceptible, and which for a long time my Reason struggled to rejectas fanciful--it had, at length, assumed a rigorous distinctness ofoutline. It was now the representation of an object that I shudder toname--and for this, above all, I loathed, and dreaded, and would haverid myself of the monster _had I dared_--it was now, I say, the imageof a hideous--of a ghastly thing--of the GALLOWS!--oh, mournful andterrible engine of Horror and of Crime--of Agony and of Death!And now was I indeed wretched beyond the wretchedness of mere Humanity.And _a brute beast _--whose fellow I had contemptuously destroyed--_abrute beast_ to work out for _me_--for me a man, fashioned in the imageof the High God--so much of insufferable wo! Alas! neither by day norby night knew I the blessing of Rest any more! During the former thecreature left me no moment alone; and, in the latter, I started, hourly,from dreams of unutterable fear, to find the hot breath of _the thing_upon my face, and its vast weight--an incarnate Night-Mare that I had nopower to shake off--incumbent eternally upon my _heart!_Beneath the pressure of torments such as these, the feeble remnantof the good within me succumbed. Evil thoughts became my soleintimates--the darkest and most evil of thoughts. The moodiness ofmy usual temper increased to hatred of all things and of all mankind;while, from the sudden, frequent, and ungovernable outbursts of a furyto which I now blindly abandoned myself, my uncomplaining wife, alas!was the most usual and the most patient of sufferers.One day she accompanied me, upon some household errand, into the cellarof the old building which our poverty compelled us to inhabit. The catfollowed me down the steep stairs, and, nearly throwing me headlong,exasperated me to madness. Uplifting an axe, and forgetting, in mywrath, the childish dread which had hitherto stayed my hand, I aimed ablow at the animal which, of course, would have proved instantly fatalhad it descended as I wished. But this blow was arrested by the hand ofmy wife. Goaded, by the interference, into a rage more than demoniacal,I withdrew my arm from her grasp and buried the axe in her brain. Shefell dead upon the spot, without a groan.This hideous murder accomplished, I set myself forthwith, and withentire deliberation, to the task of concealing the body. I knew that Icould not remove it from the house, either by day or by night, withoutthe risk of being observed by the neighbors. Many projects enteredmy mind. At one period I thought of cutting the corpse into minutefragments, and destroying them by fire. At another, I resolved to diga grave for it in the floor of the cellar. Again, I deliberated aboutcasting it in the well in the yard--about packing it in a box, as ifmerchandize, with the usual arrangements, and so getting a porter totake it from the house. Finally I hit upon what I considered a farbetter expedient than either of these. I determined to wall it up in thecellar--as the monks of the middle ages are recorded to have walled uptheir victims.For a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted. Its walls wereloosely constructed, and had lately been plastered throughout with arough plaster, which the dampness of the atmosphere had prevented fromhardening. Moreover, in one of the walls was a projection, caused bya false chimney, or fireplace, that had been filled up, and made toresemble the red of the cellar. I made no doubt that I could readilydisplace the bricks at this point, insert the corpse, and wall the wholeup as before, so that no eye could detect any thing suspicious. And inthis calculation I was not deceived. By means of a crow-bar I easilydislodged the bricks, and, having carefully deposited the body againstthe inner wall, I propped it in that position, while, with littletrouble, I re-laid the whole structure as it originally stood. Havingprocured mortar, sand, and hair, with every possible precaution, Iprepared a plaster which could not be distinguished from the old, andwith this I very carefully went over the new brickwork. When I hadfinished, I felt satisfied that all was right. The wall did not presentthe slightest appearance of having been disturbed. The rubbish onthe floor was picked up with the minutest care. I looked aroundtriumphantly, and said to myself--&quot;Here at least, then, my labor has notbeen in vain.&quot;My next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause of somuch wretchedness; for I had, at length, firmly resolved to put it todeath. Had I been able to meet with it, at the moment, there could havebeen no doubt of its fate; but it appeared that the crafty animal hadbeen alarmed at the violence of my previous anger, and forebore topresent itself in my present mood. It is impossible to describe, or toimagine, the deep, the blissful sense of relief which the absence of thedetested creature occasioned in my bosom. It did not make itsappearance during the night--and thus for one night at least, since itsintroduction into the house, I soundly and tranquilly slept; aye, slepteven with the burden of murder upon my soul!The second and the third day passed, and still my tormentor came not.Once again I breathed as a freeman. The monster, in terror, had fled thepremises forever! I should behold it no more! My happiness was supreme!The guilt of my dark deed disturbed me but little. Some few inquirieshad been made, but these had been readily answered. Even a search hadbeen instituted--but of course nothing was to be discovered. I lookedupon my future felicity as secured.Upon the fourth day of the assassination, a party of the police came,very unexpectedly, into the house, and proceeded again to make rigorousinvestigation of the premises. Secure, however, in the inscrutability ofmy place of concealment, I felt no embarrassment whatever. The officersbade me accompany them in their search. They left no nook or cornerunexplored. At length, for the third or fourth time, they descended intothe cellar. I quivered not in a muscle. My heart beat calmly as that ofone who slumbers in innocence. I walked the cellar from end to end. Ifolded my arms upon my bosom, and roamed easily to and fro. The policewere thoroughly satisfied and prepared to depart. The glee at my heartwas too strong to be restrained. I burned to say if but one word, byway of triumph, and to render doubly sure their assurance of myguiltlessness.&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; I said at last, as the party ascended the steps, &quot;I delightto have allayed your suspicions. I wish you all health, and a littlemore courtesy. By the bye, gentlemen, this--this is a very wellconstructed house.&quot; [In the rabid desire to say something easily, Iscarcely knew what I uttered at all.]--&quot;I may say an _excellently_ wellconstructed house. These walls--are you going, gentlemen?--these wallsare solidly put together;&quot; and here, through the mere phrenzy ofbravado, I rapped heavily, with a cane which I held in my hand, uponthat very portion of the brick-work behind which stood the corpse of thewife of my bosom.But may God shield and deliver me from the fangs of the Arch-Fiend! Nosooner had the reverberation of my blows sunk into silence, than I wasanswered by a voice from within the tomb!--by a cry, at first muffledand broken, like the sobbing of a child, and then quickly swelling intoone long, loud, and continuous scream, utterly anomalous and inhuman--ahowl--a wailing shriek, half of horror and half of triumph, such asmight have arisen only out of hell, conjointly from the throats of thedammed in their agony and of the demons that exult in the damnation.Of my own thoughts it is folly to speak. Swooning, I staggered tothe opposite wall. For one instant the party upon the stairs remainedmotionless, through extremity of terror and of awe. In the next, a dozenstout arms were toiling at the wall. It fell bodily. The corpse, alreadygreatly decayed and clotted with gore, stood erect before the eyes ofthe spectators. Upon its head, with red extended mouth and solitary eyeof fire, sat the hideous beast whose craft had seduced me into murder,and whose informing voice had consigned me to the hangman. I had walledthe monster up within the tomb!THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER     Son coeur est un luth suspendu;     SitÃ´t qu'on le touche il rÃ¨sonne..                             _  De BÃ©ranger_.DURING the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of theyear, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I hadbeen passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract ofcountry; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drewon, within view of the melancholy House of Usher. I know not howit was--but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense ofinsufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for thefeeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic,sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternestnatural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the scenebefore me--upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of thedomain--upon the bleak walls--upon the vacant eye-like windows--upon afew rank sedges--and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees--with anutter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensationmore properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium--thebitter lapse into everyday life--the hideous dropping off of the veil.There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart--an unredeemeddreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could tortureinto aught of the sublime. What was it--I paused to think--what was itthat so unnerved me in the contemplation of the House of Usher? It was amystery all insoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies thatcrowded upon me as I pondered. I was forced to fall back upon theunsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there _are_combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thusaffecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among considerationsbeyond our depth. It was possible, I reflected, that a mere differentarrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of thepicture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate itscapacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reinedmy horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay inunruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down--but with a shuddereven more thrilling than before--upon the remodelled and inverted imagesof the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the vacant andeye-like windows.Nevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself asojourn of some weeks. Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been one ofmy boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our lastmeeting. A letter, however, had lately reached me in a distant part ofthe country--a letter from him--which, in its wildly importunate nature,had admitted of no other than a personal reply. The MS. gave evidence ofnervous agitation. The writer spoke of acute bodily illness--of a mentaldisorder which oppressed him--and of an earnest desire to see me, as hisbest, and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of attempting, bythe cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his malady. Itwas the manner in which all this, and much more, was said--it was theapparent _heart_ that went with his request--which allowed me noroom for hesitation; and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what I stillconsidered a very singular summons.Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I reallyknew little of my friend. His reserve had been always excessive andhabitual. I was aware, however, that his very ancient family had beennoted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament,displaying itself, through long ages, in many works of exalted art, andmanifested, of late, in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusivecharity, as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhapseven more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties, ofmusical science. I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that thestem of the Usher race, all time-honored as it was, had put forth, at noperiod, any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family layin the direct line of descent, and had always, with very trifling andvery temporary variation, so lain. It was this deficiency, I considered,while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character ofthe premises with the accredited character of the people, and whilespeculating upon the possible influence which the one, in the longlapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other--it was thisdeficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent undeviatingtransmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with the name, whichhad, at length, so identified the two as to merge the original titleof the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the &quot;Houseof Usher&quot;--an appellation which seemed to include, in the minds of thepeasantry who used it, both the family and the family mansion.I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childishexperiment--that of looking down within the tarn--had been to deepen thefirst singular impression. There can be no doubt that the consciousnessof the rapid increase of my superstition--for why should I not so termit?--served mainly to accelerate the increase itself. Such, I havelong known, is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as abasis. And it might have been for this reason only, that, when I againuplifted my eyes to the house itself, from its image in the pool, theregrew in my mind a strange fancy--a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that Ibut mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressedme. I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe thatabout the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiarto themselves and their immediate vicinity--an atmosphere which hadno affinity with the air of heaven, but which had reeked up from thedecayed trees, and the gray wall, and the silent tarn--a pestilent andmystic vapor, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued.Shaking off from my spirit what _must_ have been a dream, I scanned morenarrowly the real aspect of the building. Its principal feature seemedto be that of an excessive antiquity. The discoloration of ages had beengreat. Minute fungi overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a finetangled web-work from the eaves. Yet all this was apart from anyextraordinary dilapidation. No portion of the masonry had fallen; andthere appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfectadaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the individualstones. In this there was much that reminded me of the specious totalityof old wood-work which has rotted for long years in some neglectedvault, with no disturbance from the breath of the external air. Beyondthis indication of extensive decay, however, the fabric gave littletoken of instability. Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer mighthave discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending from theroof of the building in front, made its way down the wall in a zigzagdirection, until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn.Noticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house. Aservant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic archway ofthe hall. A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me, in silence,through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the _studio_of his master. Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I knownot how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have alreadyspoken. While the objects around me--while the carvings of the ceilings,the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebon blackness of the floors,and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as I strode, werebut matters to which, or to such as which, I had been accustomed from myinfancy--while I hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was allthis--I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies whichordinary images were stirring up. On one of the staircases, I met thephysician of the family. His countenance, I thought, wore a mingledexpression of low cunning and perplexity. He accosted me withtrepidation and passed on. The valet now threw open a door and usheredme into the presence of his master.The room in which I found myself was very large and lofty. The windowswere long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from the blackoaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within. Feeble gleamsof encrimsoned light made their way through the trellissed panes,and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objectsaround; the eye, however, struggled in vain to reach the remoter anglesof the chamber, or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling.Dark draperies hung upon the walls. The general furniture was profuse,comfortless, antique, and tattered. Many books and musical instrumentslay scattered about, but failed to give any vitality to the scene. Ifelt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow. An air of stern, deep, andirredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all.Upon my entrance, Usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying atfull length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much init, I at first thought, of an overdone cordiality--of the constrainedeffort of the _ennuyÃ©_ man of the world. A glance, however, at hiscountenance, convinced me of his perfect sincerity. We sat down; and forsome moments, while he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling halfof pity, half of awe. Surely, man had never before so terribly altered,in so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher! It was with difficulty thatI could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before mewith the companion of my early boyhood. Yet the character of his facehad been at all times remarkable. A cadaverousness of complexion; an eyelarge, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin andvery pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of adelicate Hebrew model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similarformations; a finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence,of a want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness andtenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the regionsof the temple, made up altogether a countenance not easily to beforgotten. And now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing characterof these features, and of the expression they were wont to convey, layso much of change that I doubted to whom I spoke. The now ghastly pallorof the skin, and the now miraculous lustre of the eye, above all thingsstartled and even awed me. The silken hair, too, had been suffered togrow all unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floatedrather than fell about the face, I could not, even with effort, connectits Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence--aninconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from a series of feebleand futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy--an excessivenervous agitation. For something of this nature I had indeed beenprepared, no less by his letter, than by reminiscences of certainboyish traits, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physicalconformation and temperament. His action was alternately vivacious andsullen. His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when theanimal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance) to that species of energeticconcision--that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-soundingenunciation--that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulatedguttural utterance, which may be observed in the lost drunkard, or theirreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of his most intenseexcitement.It was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnestdesire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to afford him. Heentered, at some length, into what he conceived to be the nature of hismalady. It was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and onefor which he despaired to find a remedy--a mere nervous affection, heimmediately added, which would undoubtedly soon pass off. It displayeditself in a host of unnatural sensations. Some of these, as he detailedthem, interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms, andthe general manner of the narration had their weight. He suffered muchfrom a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food was aloneendurable; he could wear only garments of certain texture; the odorsof all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were tortured by even a faintlight; and there were but peculiar sounds, and these from stringedinstruments, which did not inspire him with horror.To an anomalous species of terror I found him a bounden slave. &quot;I shallperish,&quot; said he, &quot;I must perish in this deplorable folly. Thus, thus,and not otherwise, shall I be lost. I dread the events of the future,not in themselves, but in their results. I shudder at the thoughtof any, even the most trivial, incident, which may operate upon thisintolerable agitation of soul. I have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger,except in its absolute effect--in terror. In this unnerved--in thispitiable condition--I feel that the period will sooner or later arrivewhen I must abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with thegrim phantasm, FEAR.&quot;I learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and equivocalhints, another singular feature of his mental condition. He wasenchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwellingwhich he tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had never venturedforth--in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyedin terms too shadowy here to be re-stated--an influence which somepeculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion, had,by dint of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit--an effectwhich the _physique_ of the gray walls and turrets, and of the dim tarninto which they all looked down, had, at length, brought about upon the_morale_ of his existence.He admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of thepeculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a morenatural and far more palpable origin--to the severe and long-continuedillness--indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution--of a tenderlybeloved sister--his sole companion for long years--his last and onlyrelative on earth. &quot;Her decease,&quot; he said, with a bitterness which I cannever forget, &quot;would leave him (him the hopeless and the frail) the lastof the ancient race of the Ushers.&quot; While he spoke, the lady Madeline(for so was she called) passed slowly through a remote portion of theapartment, and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared. Iregarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread--andyet I found it impossible to account for such feelings. A sensation ofstupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps. When adoor, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought instinctively andeagerly the countenance of the brother--but he had buried his facein his hands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinarywanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled manypassionate tears.The disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of herphysicians. A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the person,and frequent although transient affections of a partially catalepticalcharacter, were the unusual diagnosis. Hitherto she had steadily borneup against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken herselffinally to bed; but, on the closing in of the evening of my arrivalat the house, she succumbed (as her brother told me at night withinexpressible agitation) to the prostrating power of the destroyer;and I learned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person would thusprobably be the last I should obtain--that the lady, at least whileliving, would be seen by me no more.For several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either Usher ormyself: and during this period I was busied in earnest endeavors toalleviate the melancholy of my friend. We painted and read together; orI listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his speakingguitar. And thus, as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me moreunreservedly into the recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly didI perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from whichdarkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon allobjects of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing radiationof gloom.I shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I thusspent alone with the master of the House of Usher. Yet I should fail inany attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies,or of the occupations, in which he involved me, or led me the way. Anexcited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous lustre overall. His long improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears. Amongother things, I hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion andamplification of the wild air of the last waltz of Von Weber. From thepaintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touchby touch, into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the more thrillingly,because I shuddered knowing not why;--from these paintings (vivid astheir images now are before me) I would in vain endeavor to educe morethan a small portion which should lie within the compass of merelywritten words. By the utter simplicity, by the nakedness of his designs,he arrested and overawed attention. If ever mortal painted an idea, thatmortal was Roderick Usher. For me at least--in the circumstances thensurrounding me--there arose out of the pure abstractions which thehypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvass, an intensity ofintolerable awe, no shadow of which felt I ever yet in the contemplationof the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of Fuseli.One of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking not sorigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth, althoughfeebly, in words. A small picture presented the interior of an immenselylong and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls, smooth, white, andwithout interruption or device. Certain accessory points of the designserved well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceedingdepth below the surface of the earth. No outlet was observed in anyportion of its vast extent, and no torch, or other artificial source oflight was discernible; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout,and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendor.I have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve whichrendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with the exception ofcertain effects of stringed instruments. It was, perhaps, the narrowlimits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar, which gavebirth, in great measure, to the fantastic character of his performances.But the fervid _facility_ of his _impromptus_ could not be so accountedfor. They must have been, and were, in the notes, as well as in thewords of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently accompanied himselfwith rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of that intense mentalcollectedness and concentration to which I have previously alludedas observable only in particular moments of the highest artificialexcitement. The words of one of these rhapsodies I have easilyremembered. I was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed with it, ashe gave it, because, in the under or mystic current of its meaning, Ifancied that I perceived, and for the first time, a full consciousnesson the part of Usher, of the tottering of his lofty reason upon herthrone. The verses, which were entitled &quot;The Haunted Palace,&quot; ran verynearly, if not accurately, thus:                         I.     In the greenest of our valleys,         By good angels tenanted,     Once a fair and stately palace--         Radiant palace--reared its head.     In the monarch Thought's dominion--         It stood there!     Never seraph spread a pinion         Over fabric half so fair.                         II.     Banners yellow, glorious, golden,         On its roof did float and flow;     (This--all this--was in the olden         Time long ago)     And every gentle air that dallied,         In that sweet day,     Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,         A winged odor went away.                         III.     Wanderers in that happy valley         Through two luminous windows saw     Spirits moving musically         To a lute's well-tunÃ©d law,     Round about a throne, where sitting         (Porphyrogene!)     In state his glory well befitting,         The ruler of the realm was seen.                          IV.     And all with pearl and ruby glowing         Was the fair palace door,     Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,         And sparkling evermore,     A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty         Was but to sing,     In voices of surpassing beauty,         The wit and wisdom of their king.                         V.     But evil things, in robes of sorrow,         Assailed the monarch's high estate;     (Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow         Shall dawn upon him, desolate!)     And, round about his home, the glory         That blushed and bloomed     Is but a dim-remembered story         Of the old time entombed.                         VI.     And travellers now within that valley,         Through the red-litten windows, see     Vast forms that move fantastically         To a discordant melody;     While, like a rapid ghastly river,         Through the pale door,     A hideous throng rush out forever,         And laugh--but smile no more.I well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad, led us intoa train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of Usher'swhich I mention not so much on account of its novelty, (for other men* have thought thus,) as on account of the pertinacity with whichhe maintained it. This opinion, in its general form, was that of thesentience of all vegetable things. But, in his disordered fancy, theidea had assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under certainconditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization. I lack words to expressthe full extent, or the earnest _abandon_ of his persuasion. The belief,however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with the graystones of the home of his forefathers. The conditions of the sentiencehad been here, he imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation ofthese stones--in the order of their arrangement, as well as in that ofthe many _fungi_ which overspread them, and of the decayed trees whichstood around--above all, in the long undisturbed endurance of thisarrangement, and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn.Its evidence--the evidence of the sentience--was to be seen, hesaid, (and I here started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certaincondensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and thewalls. The result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yetimportunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded thedestinies of his family, and which made _him_ what I now saw him--whathe was. Such opinions need no comment, and I will make none.* Watson, Dr. Percival, Spallanzani, and especially the Bishop ofLandaff.--See &quot;Chemical Essays,&quot; vol v.Our books--the books which, for years, had formed no small portion ofthe mental existence of the invalid--were, as might be supposed, instrict keeping with this character of phantasm. We pored together oversuch works as the Ververt et Chartreuse of Gresset; the Belphegor ofMachiavelli; the Heaven and Hell of Swedenborg; the Subterranean Voyageof Nicholas Klimm by Holberg; the Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of JeanD'IndaginÃ©, and of De la Chambre; the Journey into the Blue Distance ofTieck; and the City of the Sun of Campanella. One favorite volume wasa small octavo edition of the _Directorium Inquisitorium_, by theDominican Eymeric de Gironne; and there were passages in Pomponius Mela,about the old African Satyrs and OEgipans, over which Usher would sitdreaming for hours. His chief delight, however, was found in the perusalof an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto Gothic--the manual ofa forgotten church--the _Vigiliae Mortuorum secundum Chorum EcclesiaeMaguntinae_.I could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of itsprobable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening, havinginformed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more, he stated hisintention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight, (previously to itsfinal interment,) in one of the numerous vaults within the main wallsof the building. The worldly reason, however, assigned for this singularproceeding, was one which I did not feel at liberty to dispute. Thebrother had been led to his resolution (so he told me) by considerationof the unusual character of the malady of the deceased, of certainobtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men, and of theremote and exposed situation of the burial-ground of the family. I willnot deny that when I called to mind the sinister countenance of theperson whom I met upon the staircase, on the day of my arrival atthe house, I had no desire to oppose what I regarded as at best but aharmless, and by no means an unnatural, precaution.At the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the arrangements forthe temporary entombment. The body having been encoffined, we two alonebore it to its rest. The vault in which we placed it (and which hadbeen so long unopened that our torches, half smothered in its oppressiveatmosphere, gave us little opportunity for investigation) was small,damp, and entirely without means of admission for light; lying, at greatdepth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was myown sleeping apartment. It had been used, apparently, in remote feudaltimes, for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep, and, in later days, as aplace of deposit for powder, or some other highly combustible substance,as a portion of its floor, and the whole interior of a long archwaythrough which we reached it, were carefully sheathed with copper. Thedoor, of massive iron, had been, also, similarly protected. Its immenseweight caused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon itshinges.Having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region ofhorror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin,and looked upon the face of the tenant. A striking similitude betweenthe brother and sister now first arrested my attention; and Usher,divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words from whichI learned that the deceased and himself had been twins, and thatsympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed betweenthem. Our glances, however, rested not long upon the dead--for we couldnot regard her unawed. The disease which had thus entombed the lady inthe maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictlycataleptical character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom andthe face, and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which isso terrible in death. We replaced and screwed down the lid, and, havingsecured the door of iron, made our way, with toil, into the scarcelyless gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house.And now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable changecame over the features of the mental disorder of my friend. Hisordinary manner had vanished. His ordinary occupations were neglected orforgotten. He roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal, andobjectless step. The pallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible,a more ghastly hue--but the luminousness of his eye had utterly goneout. The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and atremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually characterizedhis utterance. There were times, indeed, when I thought his unceasinglyagitated mind was laboring with some oppressive secret, to divulge whichhe struggled for the necessary courage. At times, again, I was obligedto resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, for Ibeheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of theprofoundest attention, as if listening to some imaginary sound. It wasno wonder that his condition terrified--that it infected me. I feltcreeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences ofhis own fantastic yet impressive superstitions.It was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of theseventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline within thedonjon, that I experienced the full power of such feelings. Sleep camenot near my couch--while the hours waned and waned away. I struggled toreason off the nervousness which had dominion over me. I endeavored tobelieve that much, if not all of what I felt, was due to the bewilderinginfluence of the gloomy furniture of the room--of the dark and tattereddraperies, which, tortured into motion by the breath of a risingtempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasilyabout the decorations of the bed. But my efforts were fruitless. Anirrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame; and, at length, theresat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm. Shakingthis off with a gasp and a struggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows,and, peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber,harkened--I know not why, except that an instinctive spirit promptedme--to certain low and indefinite sounds which came, through the pausesof the storm, at long intervals, I knew not whence. Overpowered by anintense sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, I threw onmy clothes with haste (for I felt that I should sleep no more during thenight), and endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable condition intowhich I had fallen, by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment.I had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on anadjoining staircase arrested my attention. I presently recognised it asthat of Usher. In an instant afterward he rapped, with a gentle touch,at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp. His countenance was, as usual,cadaverously wan--but, moreover, there was a species of mad hilarity inhis eyes--an evidently restrained _hysteria_ in his whole demeanor. Hisair appalled me--but anything was preferable to the solitude which I hadso long endured, and I even welcomed his presence as a relief.&quot;And you have not seen it?&quot; he said abruptly, after having stared abouthim for some moments in silence--&quot;you have not then seen it?--but, stay!you shall.&quot; Thus speaking, and having carefully shaded his lamp, hehurried to one of the casements, and threw it freely open to the storm.The impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet.It was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night, and onewildly singular in its terror and its beauty. A whirlwind had apparentlycollected its force in our vicinity; for there were frequent and violentalterations in the direction of the wind; and the exceeding density ofthe clouds (which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house)did not prevent our perceiving the life-like velocity with which theyflew careering from all points against each other, without passingaway into the distance. I say that even their exceeding density didnot prevent our perceiving this--yet we had no glimpse of the moon orstars--nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning. But theunder surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor, as well as allterrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing in the unnaturallight of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalationwhich hung about and enshrouded the mansion.&quot;You must not--you shall not behold this!&quot; said I, shudderingly, toUsher, as I led him, with a gentle violence, from the window to a seat.&quot;These appearances, which bewilder you, are merely electrical phenomenanot uncommon--or it may be that they have their ghastly origin inthe rank miasma of the tarn. Let us close this casement;--the air ischilling and dangerous to your frame. Here is one of your favoriteromances. I will read, and you shall listen;--and so we will pass awaythis terrible night together.&quot;The antique volume which I had taken up was the &quot;Mad Trist&quot; of SirLauncelot Canning; but I had called it a favorite of Usher's more in sadjest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in its uncouth andunimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the loftyand spiritual ideality of my friend. It was, however, the only bookimmediately at hand; and I indulged a vague hope that the excitementwhich now agitated the hypochondriac, might find relief (for the historyof mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremenessof the folly which I should read. Could I have judged, indeed, by thewild overstrained air of vivacity with which he harkened, or apparentlyharkened, to the words of the tale, I might well have congratulatedmyself upon the success of my design.I had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where Ethelred,the hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for peaceable admissioninto the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an entrance byforce. Here, it will be remembered, the words of the narrative run thus:&quot;And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was nowmighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he haddrunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit, who, in sooth,was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain upon hisshoulders, and fearing the rising of the tempest, uplifted his maceoutright, and, with blows, made quickly room in the plankings of thedoor for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling therewith sturdily, he socracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry andhollow-sounding wood alarummed and reverberated throughout the forest.&quot;At the termination of this sentence I started, and for a moment, paused;for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my excitedfancy had deceived me)--it appeared to me that, from some very remoteportion of the mansion, there came, indistinctly, to my ears, what mighthave been, in its exact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifledand dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound whichSir Launcelot had so particularly described. It was, beyond doubt,the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid therattling of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary comminglednoises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in itself, had nothing,surely, which should have interested or disturbed me. I continued thestory:&quot;But the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door, was soreenraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit; but,in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanor, andof a fiery tongue, which sate in guard before a palace of gold, with afloor of silver; and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brasswith this legend enwritten--     Who entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin;     Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win;And Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the dragon,which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a shriek sohorrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that Ethelred had fain toclose his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it, the likewhereof was never before heard.&quot;Here again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wildamazement--for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this instance,I did actually hear (although from what direction it proceeded Ifound it impossible to say) a low and apparently distant, but harsh,protracted, and most unusual screaming or grating sound--the exactcounterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon'sunnatural shriek as described by the romancer.Oppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of this second andmost extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting sensations,in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant, I still retainedsufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, thesensitive nervousness of my companion. I was by no means certain thathe had noticed the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strangealteration had, during the last few minutes, taken place in hisdemeanor. From a position fronting my own, he had gradually broughtround his chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber;and thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I sawthat his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly. His head haddropped upon his breast--yet I knew that he was not asleep, from thewide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a glance of it in profile.The motion of his body, too, was at variance with this idea--for herocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway.Having rapidly taken notice of all this, I resumed the narrative of SirLauncelot, which thus proceeded:&quot;And now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of thedragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the breaking upof the enchantment which was upon it, removed the carcass from out ofthe way before him, and approached valorously over the silver pavementof the castle to where the shield was upon the wall; which in soothtarried not for his full coming, but feel down at his feet upon thesilver floor, with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound.&quot;No sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than--as if a shieldof brass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor ofsilver--I became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic, and clangorous,yet apparently muffled reverberation. Completely unnerved, I leaped tomy feet; but the measured rocking movement of Usher was undisturbed. Irushed to the chair in which he sat. His eyes were bent fixedlybefore him, and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stonyrigidity. But, as I placed my hand upon his shoulder, there came astrong shudder over his whole person; a sickly smile quivered about hislips; and I saw that he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur,as if unconscious of my presence. Bending closely over him, I at lengthdrank in the hideous import of his words.&quot;Not hear it?--yes, I hear it, and _have_ heard it.Long--long--long--many minutes, many hours, many days, have I heardit--yet I dared not--oh, pity me, miserable wretch that I am!--I darednot--I _dared_ not speak! _We have put her living in the tomb!_ Said Inot that my senses were acute? I _now_ tell you that I heard her firstfeeble movements in the hollow coffin. I heard them--many,many days ago--yet I dared not--_I dared not speak!_ Andnow--to-night--Ethelred--ha! ha!--the breaking of the hermit's door,and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangor of the shield!--say,rather, the rending of her coffin, and the grating of the iron hinges ofher prison, and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault!Oh whither shall I fly? Will she not be here anon? Is she not hurryingto upbraid me for my haste? Have I not heard her footstep on the stair?Do I not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart?Madman!&quot;--here he sprang furiously to his feet, and shrieked out hissyllables, as if in the effort he were giving up his soul--&quot;_Madman!I tell you that she now stands without the door!_&quot;As if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been foundthe potency of a spell--the huge antique pannels to which the speakerpointed, threw slowly back, upon the instant, their ponderous and ebonyjaws. It was the work of the rushing gust--but then without those doorsthere _did_ stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady Madelineof Usher. There was blood upon her white robes, and the evidence of somebitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame. For a momentshe remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold--then,with a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon the person of herbrother, and in her violent and now final death-agonies, bore him to thefloor a corpse, and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated.From that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast. The stormwas still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself crossing the oldcauseway. Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, and I turnedto see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued; for the vast houseand its shadows were alone behind me. The radiance was that of the full,setting, and blood-red moon, which now shone vividly through that oncebarely-discernible fissure, of which I have before spoken as extendingfrom the roof of the building, in a zigzag direction, to the base. WhileI gazed, this fissure rapidly widened--there came a fierce breath ofthe whirlwind--the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon mysight--my brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushing asunder--therewas a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousandwaters--and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly andsilently over the fragments of the &quot;_House of Usher_.&quot;SILENCE--A FABLE     ALCMAN. The mountain pinnacles slumber; valleys, crags and     caves are silent.&quot;LISTEN to me,&quot; said the Demon as he placed his hand upon my head. &quot;Theregion of which I speak is a dreary region in Libya, by the borders ofthe river Zaire. And there is no quiet there, nor silence.&quot;The waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue; and they flownot onwards to the sea, but palpitate forever and forever beneath thered eye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive motion. For manymiles on either side of the river's oozy bed is a pale desert ofgigantic water-lilies. They sigh one unto the other in that solitude,and stretch towards the heaven their long and ghastly necks, and nod toand fro their everlasting heads. And there is an indistinct murmur whichcometh out from among them like the rushing of subterrene water. Andthey sigh one unto the other.&quot;But there is a boundary to their realm--the boundary of the dark,horrible, lofty forest. There, like the waves about the Hebrides, thelow underwood is agitated continually. But there is no wind throughoutthe heaven. And the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither andthither with a crashing and mighty sound. And from their high summits,one by one, drop everlasting dews. And at the roots strange poisonousflowers lie writhing in perturbed slumber. And overhead, with a rustlingand loud noise, the gray clouds rush westwardly forever, until theyroll, a cataract, over the fiery wall of the horizon. But there is nowind throughout the heaven. And by the shores of the river Zaire thereis neither quiet nor silence.&quot;It was night, and the rain fell; and falling, it was rain, but, havingfallen, it was blood. And I stood in the morass among the tall and therain fell upon my head--and the lilies sighed one unto the other in thesolemnity of their desolation.&quot;And, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist, and wascrimson in color. And mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which stoodby the shore of the river, and was lighted by the light of the moon. Andthe rock was gray, and ghastly, and tall,--and the rock was gray. Uponits front were characters engraven in the stone; and I walked throughthe morass of water-lilies, until I came close unto the shore, that Imight read the characters upon the stone. But I could not decypher them.And I was going back into the morass, when the moon shone with afuller red, and I turned and looked again upon the rock, and upon thecharacters;--and the characters were DESOLATION.&quot;And I looked upwards, and there stood a man upon the summit of therock; and I hid myself among the water-lilies that I might discover theactions of the man. And the man was tall and stately in form, and waswrapped up from his shoulders to his feet in the toga of old Rome. Andthe outlines of his figure were indistinct--but his features were thefeatures of a deity; for the mantle of the night, and of the mist, andof the moon, and of the dew, had left uncovered the features of hisface. And his brow was lofty with thought, and his eye wild with care;and, in the few furrows upon his cheek I read the fables of sorrow, andweariness, and disgust with mankind, and a longing after solitude.&quot;And the man sat upon the rock, and leaned his head upon his hand, andlooked out upon the desolation. He looked down into the low unquietshrubbery, and up into the tall primeval trees, and up higher at therustling heaven, and into the crimson moon. And I lay close withinshelter of the lilies, and observed the actions of the man. And theman trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned, and he sat upon therock.&quot;And the man turned his attention from the heaven, and looked out uponthe dreary river Zaire, and upon the yellow ghastly waters, and upon thepale legions of the water-lilies. And the man listened to the sighs ofthe water-lilies, and to the murmur that came up from among them. And Ilay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And theman trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned and he sat upon therock.&quot;Then I went down into the recesses of the morass, and waded afar inamong the wilderness of the lilies, and called unto the hippopotamiwhich dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the morass. And thehippopotami heard my call, and came, with the behemoth, unto the footof the rock, and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon. And I layclose within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And the mantrembled in the solitude;--but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.&quot;Then I cursed the elements with the curse of tumult; and a frightfultempest gathered in the heaven where, before, there had been no wind.And the heaven became livid with the violence of the tempest--and therain beat upon the head of the man--and the floods of the river camedown--and the river was tormented into foam--and the water-liliesshrieked within their beds--and the forest crumbled before the wind--andthe thunder rolled--and the lightning fell--and the rock rocked to itsfoundation. And I lay close within my covert and observed the actions ofthe man. And the man trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned andhe sat upon the rock.&quot;Then I grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, the river,and the lilies, and the wind, and the forest, and the heaven, and thethunder, and the sighs of the water-lilies. And they became accursed,and were still. And the moon ceased to totter up its pathway toheaven--and the thunder died away--and the lightning did not flash--andthe clouds hung motionless--and the waters sunk to their level andremained--and the trees ceased to rock--and the water-lilies sighed nomore--and the murmur was heard no longer from among them, nor any shadowof sound throughout the vast illimitable desert. And I looked upon thecharacters of the rock, and they were changed;--and the characters wereSILENCE.&quot;And mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man, and his countenancewas wan with terror. And, hurriedly, he raised his head from his hand,and stood forth upon the rock and listened. But there was no voicethroughout the vast illimitable desert, and the characters upon the rockwere SILENCE. And the man shuddered, and turned his face away, and fledafar off, in haste, so that I beheld him no more.&quot;Now there are fine tales in the volumes of the Magi--in the iron-bound,melancholy volumes of the Magi. Therein, I say, are glorious historiesof the Heaven, and of the Earth, and of the mighty sea--and of the Geniithat over-ruled the sea, and the earth, and the lofty heaven. There wasmuch lore too in the sayings which were said by the Sybils; and holy,holy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled aroundDodona--but, as Allah liveth, that fable which the Demon told me ashe sat by my side in the shadow of the tomb, I hold to be the mostwonderful of all! And as the Demon made an end of his story, he fellback within the cavity of the tomb and laughed. And I could not laughwith the Demon, and he cursed me because I could not laugh. And the lynxwhich dwelleth forever in the tomb, came out therefrom, and lay down atthe feet of the Demon, and looked at him steadily in the face.THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH.THE &quot;Red Death&quot; had long devastated the country. No pestilence had everbeen so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and its seal--theredness and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and suddendizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution. Thescarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim,were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathyof his fellow-men. And the whole seizure, progress and termination ofthe disease, were the incidents of half an hour.But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious. When hisdominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousandhale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames ofhis court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of hiscastellated abbeys. This was an extensive and magnificent structure, thecreation of the prince's own eccentric yet august taste. A strong andlofty wall girdled it in. This wall had gates of iron. The courtiers,having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts.They resolved to leave means neither of ingress or egress to the suddenimpulses of despair or of frenzy from within. The abbey was amplyprovisioned. With such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance tocontagion. The external world could take care of itself. In the meantimeit was folly to grieve, or to think. The prince had provided all theappliances of pleasure. There were buffoons, there were improvisatori,there were ballet-dancers, there were musicians, there was Beauty,there was wine. All these and security were within. Without was the &quot;RedDeath.&quot;It was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion,and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that the PrinceProspero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the mostunusual magnificence.It was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. But first let me tell of therooms in which it was held. There were seven--an imperial suite. In manypalaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista, while thefolding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so thatthe view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded. Here the case wasvery different; as might have been expected from the duke's love of thebizarre. The apartments were so irregularly disposed that the visionembraced but little more than one at a time. There was a sharp turn atevery twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect. To theright and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow Gothicwindow looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings ofthe suite. These windows were of stained glass whose color varied inaccordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamberinto which it opened. That at the eastern extremity was hung, forexample, in blue--and vividly blue were its windows. The second chamberwas purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes werepurple. The third was green throughout, and so were the casements. Thefourth was furnished and lighted with orange--the fifth with white--thesixth with violet. The seventh apartment was closely shrouded in blackvelvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls,falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue. Butin this chamber only, the color of the windows failed to correspond withthe decorations. The panes here were scarlet--a deep blood color. Now inno one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum, amidthe profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro ordepended from the roof. There was no light of any kind emanating fromlamp or candle within the suite of chambers. But in the corridorsthat followed the suite, there stood, opposite to each window, a heavytripod, bearing a brazier of fire that projected its rays through thetinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room. And thus were produceda multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances. But in the western orblack chamber the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the darkhangings through the blood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the extreme, andproduced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered,that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within itsprecincts at all.It was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the westernwall, a gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to and fro with adull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand made the circuitof the face, and the hour was to be stricken, there came from thebrazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep andexceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that, ateach lapse of an hour, the musicians of the orchestra were constrainedto pause, momentarily, in their performance, to hearken to the sound;and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was abrief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the chimes of theclock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew pale, and themore aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if inconfused reverie or meditation. But when the echoes had fully ceased,a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians looked ateach other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly, and madewhispering vows, each to the other, that the next chiming of the clockshould produce in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse ofsixty minutes, (which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds ofthe Time that flies,) there came yet another chiming of the clock,and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation asbefore.But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel.The tastes of the duke were peculiar. He had a fine eye for colors andeffects. He disregarded the decora of mere fashion. His plans were boldand fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre. There aresome who would have thought him mad. His followers felt that he was not.It was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he wasnot.He had directed, in great part, the moveable embellishments of the sevenchambers, upon occasion of this great fete; and it was his own guidingtaste which had given character to the masqueraders. Be sure theywere grotesque. There were much glare and glitter and piquancy andphantasm--much of what has been since seen in &quot;Hernani.&quot; There werearabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments. There weredelirious fancies such as the madman fashions. There was much of thebeautiful, much of the wanton, much of the bizarre, something of theterrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust.To and fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude ofdreams. And these--the dreams--writhed in and about, taking hue from therooms, and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echoof their steps. And, anon, there strikes the ebony clock which stands inthe hall of the velvet. And then, for a moment, all is still, and all issilent save the voice of the clock. The dreams are stiff-frozen as theystand. But the echoes of the chime die away--they have endured but aninstant--and a light, half-subdued laughter floats after them as theydepart. And now again the music swells, and the dreams live, and writheto and fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the many-tintedwindows through which stream the rays from the tripods. But to thechamber which lies most westwardly of the seven, there are now none ofthe maskers who venture; for the night is waning away; and there flows aruddier light through the blood-colored panes; and the blackness of thesable drapery appals; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet,there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnlyemphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulge in the moreremote gaieties of the other apartments.But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beatfeverishly the heart of life. And the revel went whirlingly on, until atlength there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock. And thenthe music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the waltzerswere quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before.But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of theclock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, withmore of time, into the meditations of the thoughtful among those whorevelled. And thus, too, it happened, perhaps, that before the lastechoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were manyindividuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of thepresence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of nosingle individual before. And the rumor of this new presence havingspread itself whisperingly around, there arose at length from thewhole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of disapprobation andsurprise--then, finally, of terror, of horror, and of disgust.In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well besupposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation.In truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly unlimited; butthe figure in question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the boundsof even the prince's indefinite decorum. There are chords in the heartsof the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion. Even withthe utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there arematters of which no jest can be made. The whole company, indeed, seemednow deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the strangerneither wit nor propriety existed. The figure was tall and gaunt, andshrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave. Themask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble thecountenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must havehad difficulty in detecting the cheat. And yet all this might have beenendured, if not approved, by the mad revellers around. But the mummerhad gone so far as to assume the type of the Red Death. His vesture wasdabbled in blood--and his broad brow, with all the features of the face,was besprinkled with the scarlet horror.When the eyes of Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image (whichwith a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its role,stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be convulsed, inthe first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste;but, in the next, his brow reddened with rage.&quot;Who dares?&quot; he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood nearhim--&quot;who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery? Seize him andunmask him--that we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise, from thebattlements!&quot;It was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince Prosperoas he uttered these words. They rang throughout the seven rooms loudlyand clearly--for the prince was a bold and robust man, and the music hadbecome hushed at the waving of his hand.It was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of palecourtiers by his side. At first, as he spoke, there was a slight rushingmovement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who at themoment was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and stately step,made closer approach to the speaker. But from a certain nameless awewith which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the wholeparty, there were found none who put forth hand to seize him; so that,unimpeded, he passed within a yard of the prince's person; and, whilethe vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres ofthe rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with thesame solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from thefirst, through the blue chamber to the purple--through the purple tothe green--through the green to the orange--through this again to thewhite--and even thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had beenmade to arrest him. It was then, however, that the Prince Prospero,maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice, rushedhurriedly through the six chambers, while none followed him on accountof a deadly terror that had seized upon all. He bore aloft a drawndagger, and had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three orfour feet of the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained theextremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted hispursuer. There was a sharp cry--and the dagger dropped gleaming upon thesable carpet, upon which, instantly afterwards, fell prostrate in deaththe Prince Prospero. Then, summoning the wild courage of despair,a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the blackapartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect andmotionless within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterablehorror at finding the grave-cerements and corpse-like mask which theyhandled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form.And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death. He had comelike a thief in the night. And one by one dropped the revellers in theblood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died each in the despairingposture of his fall. And the life of the ebony clock went out withthat of the last of the gay. And the flames of the tripods expired. AndDarkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all.THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO.THE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could; butwhen he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge. You, who so well know thenature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance toa threat. _At length_ I would be avenged; this was a point definitivelysettled--but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved,precluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish, but punish withimpunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes itsredresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to makehimself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.It must be understood, that neither by word nor deed had I givenFortunato cause to doubt my good will. I continued, as was my wont, tosmile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile _now_ was atthe thought of his immolation.He had a weak point--this Fortunato--although in other regards he wasa man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on hisconnoisseurship in wine. Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit.For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time andopportunity--to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian_millionaires_. In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen,was a quack--but in the matter of old wines he was sincere. In thisrespect I did not differ from him materially: I was skilful in theItalian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could.It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of thecarnival season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me withexcessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man wore motley. Hehad on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was surmountedby the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him, that Ithought I should never have done wringing his hand.I said to him--&quot;My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How remarkablywell you are looking to-day! But I have received a pipe of what passesfor Amontillado, and I have my doubts.&quot;&quot;How?&quot; said he. &quot;Amontillado? A pipe? Impossible! And in the middle ofthe carnival!&quot;&quot;I have my doubts,&quot; I replied; &quot;and I was silly enough to pay the fullAmontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not tobe found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.&quot;&quot;Amontillado!&quot;&quot;I have my doubts.&quot;&quot;Amontillado!&quot;&quot;And I must satisfy them.&quot;&quot;Amontillado!&quot;&quot;As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi. If any one has acritical turn, it is he. He will tell me--&quot;&quot;Luchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.&quot;&quot;And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for yourown.&quot;&quot;Come, let us go.&quot;&quot;Whither?&quot;&quot;To your vaults.&quot;&quot;My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature. I perceive youhave an engagement. Luchesi--&quot;&quot;I have no engagement;--come.&quot;&quot;My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with whichI perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are insufferably damp. They areencrusted with nitre.&quot;&quot;Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! Youhave been imposed upon. And as for Luchesi, he cannot distinguish Sherryfrom Amontillado.&quot;Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm. Putting on a maskof black silk, and drawing a _roquelaire_ closely about my person, Isuffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.There were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry inhonor of the time. I had told them that I should not return until themorning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house.These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediatedisappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.I took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato,bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led intothe vaults. I passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting himto be cautious as he followed. We came at length to the foot of thedescent, and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of theMontresors.The gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingledas he strode.&quot;The pipe,&quot; said he.&quot;It is farther on,&quot; said I; &quot;but observe the white web-work which gleamsfrom these cavern walls.&quot;He turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs thatdistilled the rheum of intoxication.&quot;Nitre?&quot; he asked, at length.&quot;Nitre,&quot; I replied. &quot;How long have you had that cough?&quot;&quot;Ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh!ugh! ugh!&quot;My poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.&quot;It is nothing,&quot; he said, at last.&quot;Come,&quot; I said, with decision, &quot;we will go back; your health isprecious. You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, asonce I was. You are a man to be missed. For me it is no matter. We willgo back; you will be ill, and I cannot be responsible. Besides, there isLuchesi--&quot;&quot;Enough,&quot; he said; &quot;the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill me. Ishall not die of a cough.&quot;&quot;True--true,&quot; I replied; &quot;and, indeed, I had no intention of alarmingyou unnecessarily--but you should use all proper caution. A draught ofthis Medoc will defend us from the damps.&quot;Here I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row ofits fellows that lay upon the mould.&quot;Drink,&quot; I said, presenting him the wine.He raised it to his lips with a leer. He paused and nodded to mefamiliarly, while his bells jingled.&quot;I drink,&quot; he said, &quot;to the buried that repose around us.&quot;&quot;And I to your long life.&quot;He again took my arm, and we proceeded.&quot;These vaults,&quot; he said, &quot;are extensive.&quot;&quot;The Montresors,&quot; I replied, &quot;were a great and numerous family.&quot;&quot;I forget your arms.&quot;&quot;A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpentrampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.&quot;&quot;And the motto?&quot;&quot;_Nemo me impune lacessit_.&quot;&quot;Good!&quot; he said.The wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. My own fancy grewwarm with the Medoc. We had passed through walls of piled bones, withcasks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of thecatacombs. I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize Fortunatoby an arm above the elbow.&quot;The nitre!&quot; I said: &quot;see, it increases. It hangs like moss upon thevaults. We are below the river's bed. The drops of moisture trickleamong the bones. Come, we will go back ere it is too late. Your cough--&quot;&quot;It is nothing,&quot; he said; &quot;let us go on. But first, another draught ofthe Medoc.&quot;I broke and reached him a flagon of De GrÃ¢ve. He emptied it at a breath.His eyes flashed with a fierce light. He laughed and threw the bottleupwards with a gesticulation I did not understand.I looked at him in surprise. He repeated the movement--a grotesque one.&quot;You do not comprehend?&quot; he said.&quot;Not I,&quot; I replied.&quot;Then you are not of the brotherhood.&quot;&quot;How?&quot;&quot;You are not of the masons.&quot;&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; I said, &quot;yes, yes.&quot;&quot;You? Impossible! A mason?&quot;&quot;A mason,&quot; I replied.&quot;A sign,&quot; he said.&quot;It is this,&quot; I answered, producing a trowel from beneath the folds ofmy _roquelaire_.&quot;You jest,&quot; he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. &quot;But let us proceed tothe Amontillado.&quot;&quot;Be it so,&quot; I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak, and againoffering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily. We continued our routein search of the Amontillado. We passed through a range of low arches,descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, inwhich the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow thanflame.At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another lessspacious. Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to thevault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris. Threesides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner. Fromthe fourth the bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously uponthe earth, forming at one point a mound of some size. Within the wallthus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we perceived a stillinterior recess, in depth about four feet, in width three, in heightsix or seven. It seemed to have been constructed for no especial usein itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the colossalsupports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of theircircumscribing walls of solid granite.It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavored topry into the depths of the recess. Its termination the feeble light didnot enable us to see.&quot;Proceed,&quot; I said; &quot;herein is the Amontillado. As for Luchesi--&quot;&quot;He is an ignoramus,&quot; interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadilyforward, while I followed immediately at his heels. In an instant he hadreached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrestedby the rock, stood stupidly bewildered. A moment more and I had fetteredhim to the granite. In its surface were two iron staples, distant fromeach other about two feet, horizontally. From one of these dependeda short chain, from the other a padlock. Throwing the links about hiswaist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it. He was toomuch astounded to resist. Withdrawing the key I stepped back from therecess.&quot;Pass your hand,&quot; I said, &quot;over the wall; you cannot help feeling thenitre. Indeed it is _very_ damp. Once more let me _implore_ you toreturn. No? Then I must positively leave you. But I must first renderyou all the little attentions in my power.&quot;&quot;The Amontillado!&quot; ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from hisastonishment.&quot;True,&quot; I replied; &quot;the Amontillado.&quot;As I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which Ihave before spoken. Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity ofbuilding stone and mortar. With these materials and with the aid of mytrowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.I had scarcely laid the first tier of my masonry when I discoveredthat the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off. Theearliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depthof the recess. It was _not_ the cry of a drunken man. There was then along and obstinate silence. I laid the second tier, and the third, andthe fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain. Thenoise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken toit with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labors and sat down upon thebones. When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel, andfinished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventhtier. The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast. I againpaused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a fewfeeble rays upon the figure within.A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from thethroat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back. For abrief moment I hesitated--I trembled. Unsheathing my rapier, I began togrope with it about the recess: but the thought of an instant reassuredme. I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, and feltsatisfied. I reapproached the wall. I replied to the yells of himwho clamored. I re-echoed--I aided--I surpassed them in volume and instrength. I did this, and the clamorer grew still.It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. I had completedthe eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier. I had finished a portionof the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone tobe fitted and plastered in. I struggled with its weight; I placed itpartially in its destined position. But now there came from out theniche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head. It was succeededby a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognising as that of thenoble Fortunato. The voice said--&quot;Ha! ha! ha!--he! he!--a very good joke indeed--an excellent jest. Wewill have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo--he! he! he!--overour wine--he! he! he!&quot;&quot;The Amontillado!&quot; I said.&quot;He! he! he!--he! he! he!--yes, the Amontillado. But is it not gettinglate? Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the Lady Fortunatoand the rest? Let us be gone.&quot;&quot;Yes,&quot; I said, &quot;let us be gone.&quot;&quot;_For the love of God, Montressor!_&quot;&quot;Yes,&quot; I said, &quot;for the love of God!&quot;But to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply. I grew impatient. Icalled aloud--&quot;Fortunato!&quot;No answer. I called again--&quot;Fortunato!&quot;No answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and letit fall within. There came forth in return only a jingling of the bells.My heart grew sick--on account of the dampness of the catacombs. Ihastened to make an end of my labor. I forced the last stone into itsposition; I plastered it up. Against the new masonry I re-erected theold rampart of bones. For the half of a century no mortal has disturbedthem. _In pace requiescat!_THE IMP OF THE PERVERSEIN THE consideration of the faculties and impulses--of the prima mobiliaof the human soul, the phrenologists have failed to make room for apropensity which, although obviously existing as a radical, primitive,irreducible sentiment, has been equally overlooked by all the moralistswho have preceded them. In the pure arrogance of the reason, we haveall overlooked it. We have suffered its existence to escape our senses,solely through want of belief--of faith;--whether it be faith inRevelation, or faith in the Kabbala. The idea of it has never occurredto us, simply because of its supererogation. We saw no need of theimpulse--for the propensity. We could not perceive its necessity. Wecould not understand, that is to say, we could not have understood, hadthe notion of this primum mobile ever obtruded itself;--we could nothave understood in what manner it might be made to further the objectsof humanity, either temporal or eternal. It cannot be denied thatphrenology and, in great measure, all metaphysicianism have beenconcocted a priori. The intellectual or logical man, rather than theunderstanding or observant man, set himself to imagine designs--todictate purposes to God. Having thus fathomed, to his satisfaction, theintentions of Jehovah, out of these intentions he built his innumerablesystems of mind. In the matter of phrenology, for example, we firstdetermined, naturally enough, that it was the design of the Deity thatman should eat. We then assigned to man an organ of alimentiveness,and this organ is the scourge with which the Deity compels man, will-Inill-I, into eating. Secondly, having settled it to be God's will thatman should continue his species, we discovered an organ of amativeness,forthwith. And so with combativeness, with ideality, with causality,with constructiveness,--so, in short, with every organ, whetherrepresenting a propensity, a moral sentiment, or a faculty of the pureintellect. And in these arrangements of the Principia of human action,the Spurzheimites, whether right or wrong, in part, or upon the whole,have but followed, in principle, the footsteps of their predecessors:deducing and establishing every thing from the preconceived destiny ofman, and upon the ground of the objects of his Creator.It would have been wiser, it would have been safer, to classify (ifclassify we must) upon the basis of what man usually or occasionallydid, and was always occasionally doing, rather than upon the basis ofwhat we took it for granted the Deity intended him to do. If we cannotcomprehend God in his visible works, how then in his inconceivablethoughts, that call the works into being? If we cannot understand him inhis objective creatures, how then in his substantive moods and phases ofcreation?Induction, a posteriori, would have brought phrenology to admit, as aninnate and primitive principle of human action, a paradoxical something,which we may call perverseness, for want of a more characteristic term.In the sense I intend, it is, in fact, a mobile without motive, a motivenot motivirt. Through its promptings we act without comprehensibleobject; or, if this shall be understood as a contradiction in terms, wemay so far modify the proposition as to say, that through its promptingswe act, for the reason that we should not. In theory, no reason can bemore unreasonable, but, in fact, there is none more strong. With certainminds, under certain conditions, it becomes absolutely irresistible. Iam not more certain that I breathe, than that the assurance of the wrongor error of any action is often the one unconquerable force which impelsus, and alone impels us to its prosecution. Nor will this overwhelmingtendency to do wrong for the wrong's sake, admit of analysis, orresolution into ulterior elements. It is a radical, a primitiveimpulse-elementary. It will be said, I am aware, that when we persist inacts because we feel we should not persist in them, our conduct is but amodification of that which ordinarily springs from the combativenessof phrenology. But a glance will show the fallacy of this idea. Thephrenological combativeness has for its essence, the necessity ofself-defence. It is our safeguard against injury. Its principle regardsour well-being; and thus the desire to be well is excited simultaneouslywith its development. It follows, that the desire to be well mustbe excited simultaneously with any principle which shall be merely amodification of combativeness, but in the case of that something which Iterm perverseness, the desire to be well is not only not aroused, but astrongly antagonistical sentiment exists.An appeal to one's own heart is, after all, the best reply to thesophistry just noticed. No one who trustingly consults and thoroughlyquestions his own soul, will be disposed to deny the entire radicalnessof the propensity in question. It is not more incomprehensible thandistinctive. There lives no man who at some period has not beentormented, for example, by an earnest desire to tantalize a listener bycircumlocution. The speaker is aware that he displeases; he has everyintention to please, he is usually curt, precise, and clear, the mostlaconic and luminous language is struggling for utterance upon histongue, it is only with difficulty that he restrains himself from givingit flow; he dreads and deprecates the anger of him whom he addresses;yet, the thought strikes him, that by certain involutions andparentheses this anger may be engendered. That single thought is enough.The impulse increases to a wish, the wish to a desire, the desire toan uncontrollable longing, and the longing (to the deep regret andmortification of the speaker, and in defiance of all consequences) isindulged.We have a task before us which must be speedily performed. We know thatit will be ruinous to make delay. The most important crisis of our lifecalls, trumpet-tongued, for immediate energy and action. We glow, we areconsumed with eagerness to commence the work, with the anticipation ofwhose glorious result our whole souls are on fire. It must, it shall beundertaken to-day, and yet we put it off until to-morrow, and why?There is no answer, except that we feel perverse, using the word withno comprehension of the principle. To-morrow arrives, and with it a moreimpatient anxiety to do our duty, but with this very increase of anxietyarrives, also, a nameless, a positively fearful, because unfathomable,craving for delay. This craving gathers strength as the moments fly.The last hour for action is at hand. We tremble with the violence ofthe conflict within us,--of the definite with the indefinite--of thesubstance with the shadow. But, if the contest have proceeded thusfar, it is the shadow which prevails,--we struggle in vain. The clockstrikes, and is the knell of our welfare. At the same time, it isthe chanticleer--note to the ghost that has so long overawed us. Itflies--it disappears--we are free. The old energy returns. We will labornow. Alas, it is too late!We stand upon the brink of a precipice. We peer into the abyss--wegrow sick and dizzy. Our first impulse is to shrink from the danger.Unaccountably we remain. By slow degrees our sickness and dizziness andhorror become merged in a cloud of unnamable feeling. By gradations,still more imperceptible, this cloud assumes shape, as did the vaporfrom the bottle out of which arose the genius in the Arabian Nights.But out of this our cloud upon the precipice's edge, there grows intopalpability, a shape, far more terrible than any genius or any demonof a tale, and yet it is but a thought, although a fearful one, and onewhich chills the very marrow of our bones with the fierceness of thedelight of its horror. It is merely the idea of what would be oursensations during the sweeping precipitancy of a fall from such aheight. And this fall--this rushing annihilation--for the very reasonthat it involves that one most ghastly and loathsome of all the mostghastly and loathsome images of death and suffering which have everpresented themselves to our imagination--for this very cause do we nowthe most vividly desire it. And because our reason violently deters usfrom the brink, therefore do we the most impetuously approach it. Thereis no passion in nature so demoniacally impatient, as that of him who,shuddering upon the edge of a precipice, thus meditates a Plunge. Toindulge, for a moment, in any attempt at thought, is to be inevitablylost; for reflection but urges us to forbear, and therefore it is, Isay, that we cannot. If there be no friendly arm to check us, or if wefail in a sudden effort to prostrate ourselves backward from the abyss,we plunge, and are destroyed.Examine these similar actions as we will, we shall find them resultingsolely from the spirit of the Perverse. We perpetrate them because wefeel that we should not. Beyond or behind this there is no intelligibleprinciple; and we might, indeed, deem this perverseness a directinstigation of the Arch-Fiend, were it not occasionally known to operatein furtherance of good.I have said thus much, that in some measure I may answer your question,that I may explain to you why I am here, that I may assign to yousomething that shall have at least the faint aspect of a cause for mywearing these fetters, and for my tenanting this cell of the condemned.Had I not been thus prolix, you might either have misunderstood mealtogether, or, with the rabble, have fancied me mad. As it is, you willeasily perceive that I am one of the many uncounted victims of the Impof the Perverse.It is impossible that any deed could have been wrought with a morethorough deliberation. For weeks, for months, I pondered upon themeans of the murder. I rejected a thousand schemes, because theiraccomplishment involved a chance of detection. At length, in readingsome French Memoirs, I found an account of a nearly fatal illness thatoccurred to Madame Pilau, through the agency of a candle accidentallypoisoned. The idea struck my fancy at once. I knew my victim's habitof reading in bed. I knew, too, that his apartment was narrow andill-ventilated. But I need not vex you with impertinent details. I neednot describe the easy artifices by which I substituted, in his bed-roomcandle-stand, a wax-light of my own making for the one which I therefound. The next morning he was discovered dead in his bed, and theCoroner's verdict was--&quot;Death by the visitation of God.&quot;Having inherited his estate, all went well with me for years. The ideaof detection never once entered my brain. Of the remains of the fataltaper I had myself carefully disposed. I had left no shadow of a clewby which it would be possible to convict, or even to suspect me of thecrime. It is inconceivable how rich a sentiment of satisfaction arosein my bosom as I reflected upon my absolute security. For a very longperiod of time I was accustomed to revel in this sentiment. It affordedme more real delight than all the mere worldly advantages accruing frommy sin. But there arrived at length an epoch, from which the pleasurablefeeling grew, by scarcely perceptible gradations, into a haunting andharassing thought. It harassed because it haunted. I could scarcely getrid of it for an instant. It is quite a common thing to be thus annoyedwith the ringing in our ears, or rather in our memories, of the burthenof some ordinary song, or some unimpressive snatches from an opera.Nor will we be the less tormented if the song in itself be good, orthe opera air meritorious. In this manner, at last, I would perpetuallycatch myself pondering upon my security, and repeating, in a lowundertone, the phrase, &quot;I am safe.&quot;One day, whilst sauntering along the streets, I arrested myself in theact of murmuring, half aloud, these customary syllables. In a fit ofpetulance, I remodelled them thus; &quot;I am safe--I am safe--yes--if I benot fool enough to make open confession!&quot;No sooner had I spoken these words, than I felt an icy chill creep tomy heart. I had had some experience in these fits of perversity, (whosenature I have been at some trouble to explain), and I remembered wellthat in no instance I had successfully resisted their attacks. And nowmy own casual self-suggestion that I might possibly be fool enough toconfess the murder of which I had been guilty, confronted me, as if thevery ghost of him whom I had murdered--and beckoned me on to death.At first, I made an effort to shake off this nightmare of the soul.I walked vigorously--faster--still faster--at length I ran. I felta maddening desire to shriek aloud. Every succeeding wave of thoughtoverwhelmed me with new terror, for, alas! I well, too well understoodthat to think, in my situation, was to be lost. I still quickened mypace. I bounded like a madman through the crowded thoroughfares. Atlength, the populace took the alarm, and pursued me. I felt then theconsummation of my fate. Could I have torn out my tongue, I would havedone it, but a rough voice resounded in my ears--a rougher grasp seizedme by the shoulder. I turned--I gasped for breath. For a moment Iexperienced all the pangs of suffocation; I became blind, and deaf,and giddy; and then some invisible fiend, I thought, struck me with hisbroad palm upon the back. The long imprisoned secret burst forth from mysoul.They say that I spoke with a distinct enunciation, but with markedemphasis and passionate hurry, as if in dread of interruption beforeconcluding the brief, but pregnant sentences that consigned me to thehangman and to hell.Having related all that was necessary for the fullest judicialconviction, I fell prostrate in a swoon.But why shall I say more? To-day I wear these chains, and am here!To-morrow I shall be fetterless!--but where?THE ISLAND OF THE FAY     Nullus enim locus sine genio est.--_Servius_.&quot;LA MUSIQUE,&quot; says Marmontel, in those &quot;Contes Moraux&quot; (*1) which in allour translations, we have insisted upon calling &quot;Moral Tales,&quot; as ifin mockery of their spirit--&quot;la musique est le seul des talents quijouissent de lui-meme; tous les autres veulent des temoins.&quot; He hereconfounds the pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacityfor creating them. No more than any other talent, is that for musicsusceptible of complete enjoyment, where there is no second party toappreciate its exercise. And it is only in common with other talentsthat it produces effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude. Theidea which the raconteur has either failed to entertain clearly, orhas sacrificed in its expression to his national love of point, is,doubtless, the very tenable one that the higher order of music isthe most thoroughly estimated when we are exclusively alone. Theproposition, in this form, will be admitted at once by those who lovethe lyre for its own sake, and for its spiritual uses. But there is onepleasure still within the reach of fallen mortality and perhaps onlyone--which owes even more than does music to the accessory sentimentof seclusion. I mean the happiness experienced in the contemplation ofnatural scenery. In truth, the man who would behold aright the glory ofGod upon earth must in solitude behold that glory. To me, at least, thepresence--not of human life only, but of life in any other form thanthat of the green things which grow upon the soil and are voiceless--isa stain upon the landscape--is at war with the genius of the scene. Ilove, indeed, to regard the dark valleys, and the gray rocks, andthe waters that silently smile, and the forests that sigh in uneasyslumbers, and the proud watchful mountains that look down upon all,--Ilove to regard these as themselves but the colossal members of one vastanimate and sentient whole--a whole whose form (that of the sphere)is the most perfect and most inclusive of all; whose path is amongassociate planets; whose meek handmaiden is the moon, whose mediatesovereign is the sun; whose life is eternity, whose thought is that ofa God; whose enjoyment is knowledge; whose destinies are lost inimmensity, whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own cognizanceof the animalculae which infest the brain--a being which we, inconsequence, regard as purely inanimate and material much in the samemanner as these animalculae must thus regard us.Our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us onevery hand--notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of thepriesthood--that space, and therefore that bulk, is an importantconsideration in the eyes of the Almighty. The cycles in which the starsmove are those best adapted for the evolution, without collision, ofthe greatest possible number of bodies. The forms of those bodies areaccurately such as, within a given surface, to include the greatestpossible amount of matter;--while the surfaces themselves areso disposed as to accommodate a denser population than could beaccommodated on the same surfaces otherwise arranged. Nor is it anyargument against bulk being an object with God, that space itself isinfinite; for there may be an infinity of matter to fill it. Andsince we see clearly that the endowment of matter with vitality is aprinciple--indeed, as far as our judgments extend, the leading principlein the operations of Deity,--it is scarcely logical to imagine itconfined to the regions of the minute, where we daily trace it, and notextending to those of the august. As we find cycle within cycle withoutend,--yet all revolving around one far-distant centre which is theGod-head, may we not analogically suppose in the same manner, lifewithin life, the less within the greater, and all within the SpiritDivine? In short, we are madly erring, through self-esteem, in believingman, in either his temporal or future destinies, to be of more momentin the universe than that vast &quot;clod of the valley&quot; which he tills andcontemns, and to which he denies a soul for no more profound reason thanthat he does not behold it in operation. (*2)These fancies, and such as these, have always given to my meditationsamong the mountains and the forests, by the rivers and the ocean, atinge of what the everyday world would not fail to term fantastic. Mywanderings amid such scenes have been many, and far-searching, and oftensolitary; and the interest with which I have strayed through many a dim,deep valley, or gazed into the reflected Heaven of many a bright lake,has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that I have strayedand gazed alone. What flippant Frenchman was it who said in allusionto the well-known work of Zimmerman, that, &quot;la solitude est une bellechose; mais il faut quelqu'un pour vous dire que la solitude est unebelle chose?&quot; The epigram cannot be gainsayed; but the necessity is athing that does not exist.It was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far distant regionof mountain locked within mountain, and sad rivers and melancholy tarnwrithing or sleeping within all--that I chanced upon a certain rivuletand island. I came upon them suddenly in the leafy June, and threwmyself upon the turf, beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub,that I might doze as I contemplated the scene. I felt that thus onlyshould I look upon it--such was the character of phantasm which it wore.On all sides--save to the west, where the sun was about sinking--arosethe verdant walls of the forest. The little river which turned sharplyin its course, and was thus immediately lost to sight, seemed to haveno exit from its prison, but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage ofthe trees to the east--while in the opposite quarter (so it appeared tome as I lay at length and glanced upward) there poured down noiselesslyand continuously into the valley, a rich golden and crimson waterfallfrom the sunset fountains of the sky.About midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in, onesmall circular island, profusely verdured, reposed upon the bosom of thestream.So blended bank and shadow thereThat each seemed pendulous in air--so mirror-like was the glassy water,that it was scarcely possible to say at what point upon the slope of theemerald turf its crystal dominion began.My position enabled me to include in a single view both the eastern andwestern extremities of the islet; and I observed a singularly-markeddifference in their aspects. The latter was all one radiant harem ofgarden beauties. It glowed and blushed beneath the eyes of the slantsunlight, and fairly laughed with flowers. The grass was short,springy, sweet-scented, and Asphodel-interspersed. The trees were lithe,mirthful, erect--bright, slender, and graceful,--of eastern figure andfoliage, with bark smooth, glossy, and parti-colored. There seemed adeep sense of life and joy about all; and although no airs blew from outthe heavens, yet every thing had motion through the gentle sweepings toand fro of innumerable butterflies, that might have been mistaken fortulips with wings. (*4)The other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest shade.A sombre, yet beautiful and peaceful gloom here pervaded all things. Thetrees were dark in color, and mournful in form and attitude, wreathingthemselves into sad, solemn, and spectral shapes that conveyed ideas ofmortal sorrow and untimely death. The grass wore the deep tint of thecypress, and the heads of its blades hung droopingly, and hither andthither among it were many small unsightly hillocks, low and narrow,and not very long, that had the aspect of graves, but were not; althoughover and all about them the rue and the rosemary clambered. The shadeof the trees fell heavily upon the water, and seemed to bury itselftherein, impregnating the depths of the element with darkness. I fanciedthat each shadow, as the sun descended lower and lower, separated itselfsullenly from the trunk that gave it birth, and thus became absorbed bythe stream; while other shadows issued momently from the trees, takingthe place of their predecessors thus entombed.This idea, having once seized upon my fancy, greatly excited it, and Ilost myself forthwith in revery. &quot;If ever island were enchanted,&quot; saidI to myself, &quot;this is it. This is the haunt of the few gentle Fays whoremain from the wreck of the race. Are these green tombs theirs?--or dothey yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own? In dying,do they not rather waste away mournfully, rendering unto God, little bylittle, their existence, as these trees render up shadow after shadow,exhausting their substance unto dissolution? What the wasting tree is tothe water that imbibes its shade, growing thus blacker by what it preysupon, may not the life of the Fay be to the death which engulfs it?&quot;As I thus mused, with half-shut eyes, while the sun sank rapidly torest, and eddying currents careered round and round the island, bearingupon their bosom large, dazzling, white flakes of the bark of thesycamore-flakes which, in their multiform positions upon the water, aquick imagination might have converted into any thing it pleased, whileI thus mused, it appeared to me that the form of one of those very Faysabout whom I had been pondering made its way slowly into the darknessfrom out the light at the western end of the island. She stood erectin a singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom of anoar. While within the influence of the lingering sunbeams, her attitudeseemed indicative of joy--but sorrow deformed it as she passed withinthe shade. Slowly she glided along, and at length rounded the islet andre-entered the region of light. &quot;The revolution which has just been madeby the Fay,&quot; continued I, musingly, &quot;is the cycle of the brief year ofher life. She has floated through her winter and through her summer. Sheis a year nearer unto Death; for I did not fail to see that, as she cameinto the shade, her shadow fell from her, and was swallowed up in thedark water, making its blackness more black.&quot;And again the boat appeared and the Fay, but about the attitude of thelatter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy.She floated again from out the light and into the gloom (which deepenedmomently) and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water, andbecame absorbed into its blackness. And again and again she made thecircuit of the island, (while the sun rushed down to his slumbers), andat each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person,while it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct, and at eachpassage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade, which becamewhelmed in a shadow more black. But at length when the sun hadutterly departed, the Fay, now the mere ghost of her former self, wentdisconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony flood, andthat she issued thence at all I cannot say, for darkness fell over allthings and I beheld her magical figure no more.THE ASSIGNATION     Stay for me there!   I will not fail.     To meet thee in that hollow vale.     [_Exequy on the death of his wife, by Henry King,      Bishop of Chichester_.]ILL-FATED and mysterious man!--bewildered in the brilliancy of thine ownimagination, and fallen in the flames of thine own youth! Again in fancyI behold thee! Once more thy form hath risen before me!--not--oh notas thou art--in the cold valley and shadow--but as thou _shouldstbe_--squandering away a life of magnificent meditation in that city ofdim visions, thine own Venice--which is a star-beloved Elysium of thesea, and the wide windows of whose Palladian palaces look down with adeep and bitter meaning upon the secrets of her silent waters. Yes! Irepeat it--as thou _shouldst be_. There are surely other worldsthan this--other thoughts than the thoughts of the multitude--otherspeculations than the speculations of the sophist. Who then shall callthy conduct into question? who blame thee for thy visionary hours, ordenounce those occupations as a wasting away of life, which were but theoverflowings of thine everlasting energies?It was at Venice, beneath the covered archway there called the _Ponte diSospiri_, that I met for the third or fourth time the person of whomI speak. It is with a confused recollection that I bring to mindthe circumstances of that meeting. Yet I remember--ah! how should Iforget?--the deep midnight, the Bridge of Sighs, the beauty of woman,and the Genius of Romance that stalked up and down the narrow canal.It was a night of unusual gloom. The great clock of the Piazza hadsounded the fifth hour of the Italian evening. The square of theCampanile lay silent and deserted, and the lights in the old DucalPalace were dying fast away. I was returning home from the Piazetta, byway of the Grand Canal. But as my gondola arrived opposite the mouthof the canal San Marco, a female voice from its recesses broke suddenlyupon the night, in one wild, hysterical, and long continued shriek.Startled at the sound, I sprang upon my feet: while the gondolier,letting slip his single oar, lost it in the pitchy darkness beyond achance of recovery, and we were consequently left to the guidance of thecurrent which here sets from the greater into the smaller channel.Like some huge and sable-feathered condor, we were slowly drifting downtowards the Bridge of Sighs, when a thousand flambeaux flashing from thewindows, and down the staircases of the Ducal Palace, turned all at oncethat deep gloom into a livid and preternatural day.A child, slipping from the arms of its own mother, had fallen from anupper window of the lofty structure into the deep and dim canal. Thequiet waters had closed placidly over their victim; and, although my owngondola was the only one in sight, many a stout swimmer, already in thestream, was seeking in vain upon the surface, the treasure which wasto be found, alas! only within the abyss. Upon the broad black marbleflagstones at the entrance of the palace, and a few steps above thewater, stood a figure which none who then saw can have ever sinceforgotten. It was the Marchesa Aphrodite--the adoration of allVenice--the gayest of the gay--the most lovely where all werebeautiful--but still the young wife of the old and intriguing Mentoni,and the mother of that fair child, her first and only one, who now, deepbeneath the murky water, was thinking in bitterness of heart upon hersweet caresses, and exhausting its little life in struggles to call uponher name.She stood alone. Her small, bare, and silvery feet gleamed in theblack mirror of marble beneath her. Her hair, not as yet more thanhalf loosened for the night from its ball-room array, clustered, amida shower of diamonds, round and round her classical head, in curls likethose of the young hyacinth. A snowy-white and gauze-like drapery seemedto be nearly the sole covering to her delicate form; but the mid-summerand midnight air was hot, sullen, and still, and no motion in thestatue-like form itself, stirred even the folds of that raiment of veryvapor which hung around it as the heavy marble hangs around the Niobe.Yet--strange to say!--her large lustrous eyes were not turned downwardsupon that grave wherein her brightest hope lay buried--but riveted in awidely different direction! The prison of the Old Republic is, I think,the stateliest building in all Venice--but how could that lady gaze sofixedly upon it, when beneath her lay stifling her only child? Yon dark,gloomy niche, too, yawns right opposite her chamber window--what,then, _could_ there be in its shadows--in its architecture--in itsivy-wreathed and solemn cornices--that the Marchesa di Mentoni had notwondered at a thousand times before? Nonsense!--Who does not rememberthat, at such a time as this, the eye, like a shattered mirror,multiplies the images of its sorrow, and sees in innumerable far-offplaces, the woe which is close at hand?Many steps above the Marchesa, and within the arch of the water-gate,stood, in full dress, the Satyr-like figure of Mentoni himself. He wasoccasionally occupied in thrumming a guitar, and seemed _ennuye_ to thevery death, as at intervals he gave directions for the recovery of hischild. Stupified and aghast, I had myself no power to move from theupright position I had assumed upon first hearing the shriek, and musthave presented to the eyes of the agitated group a spectral and ominousappearance, as with pale countenance and rigid limbs, I floated downamong them in that funereal gondola.All efforts proved in vain. Many of the most energetic in the searchwere relaxing their exertions, and yielding to a gloomy sorrow. Thereseemed but little hope for the child; (how much less than for themother!) but now, from the interior of that dark niche which has beenalready mentioned as forming a part of the Old Republican prison, andas fronting the lattice of the Marchesa, a figure muffled in a cloak,stepped out within reach of the light, and, pausing a moment upon theverge of the giddy descent, plunged headlong into the canal. As, in aninstant afterwards, he stood with the still living and breathingchild within his grasp, upon the marble flagstones by the side of theMarchesa, his cloak, heavy with the drenching water, became unfastened,and, falling in folds about his feet, discovered to the wonder-strickenspectators the graceful person of a very young man, with the sound ofwhose name the greater part of Europe was then ringing.No word spoke the deliverer. But the Marchesa! She will now receiveher child--she will press it to her heart--she will cling to its littleform, and smother it with her caresses. Alas! _another's_ arms havetaken it from the stranger--_another's_ arms have taken it away, andborne it afar off, unnoticed, into the palace! And the Marchesa! Herlip--her beautiful lip trembles: tears are gathering in her eyes--thoseeyes which, like Pliny's acanthus, are &quot;soft and almost liquid.&quot; Yes!tears are gathering in those eyes--and see! the entire woman thrillsthroughout the soul, and the statue has started into life! The pallorof the marble countenance, the swelling of the marble bosom, the verypurity of the marble feet, we behold suddenly flushed over with a tideof ungovernable crimson; and a slight shudder quivers about her delicateframe, as a gentle air at Napoli about the rich silver lilies in thegrass.Why _should_ that lady blush! To this demand there is no answer--exceptthat, having left, in the eager haste and terror of a mother's heart,the privacy of her own _boudoir_, she has neglected to enthral her tinyfeet in their slippers, and utterly forgotten to throw over her Venetianshoulders that drapery which is their due. What other possible reasoncould there have been for her so blushing?--for the glance of those wildappealing eyes? for the unusual tumult of that throbbing bosom?--for theconvulsive pressure of that trembling hand?--that hand which fell,as Mentoni turned into the palace, accidentally, upon the hand of thestranger. What reason could there have been for the low--the singularlylow tone of those unmeaning words which the lady uttered hurriedly inbidding him adieu? &quot;Thou hast conquered,&quot; she said, or the murmurs ofthe water deceived me; &quot;thou hast conquered--one hour after sunrise--weshall meet--so let it be!&quot;* * * * *The tumult had subsided, the lights had died away within the palace,and the stranger, whom I now recognized, stood alone upon the flags. Heshook with inconceivable agitation, and his eye glanced around in searchof a gondola. I could not do less than offer him the service of my own;and he accepted the civility. Having obtained an oar at the water-gate,we proceeded together to his residence, while he rapidly recovered hisself-possession, and spoke of our former slight acquaintance in terms ofgreat apparent cordiality.There are some subjects upon which I take pleasure in being minute. Theperson of the stranger--let me call him by this title, who to all theworld was still a stranger--the person of the stranger is one of thesesubjects. In height he might have been below rather than above themedium size: although there were moments of intense passion when hisframe actually _expanded_ and belied the assertion. The light, almostslender symmetry of his figure, promised more of that ready activitywhich he evinced at the Bridge of Sighs, than of that Herculean strengthwhich he has been known to wield without an effort, upon occasions ofmore dangerous emergency. With the mouth and chin of a deity--singular,wild, full, liquid eyes, whose shadows varied from pure hazel to intenseand brilliant jet--and a profusion of curling, black hair, from whicha forehead of unusual breadth gleamed forth at intervals all light andivory--his were features than which I have seen none more classicallyregular, except, perhaps, the marble ones of the Emperor Commodus. Yethis countenance was, nevertheless, one of those which all men have seenat some period of their lives, and have never afterwards seen again. Ithad no peculiar--it had no settled predominant expression to be fastenedupon the memory; a countenance seen and instantly forgotten--butforgotten with a vague and never-ceasing desire of recalling it to mind.Not that the spirit of each rapid passion failed, at any time, tothrow its own distinct image upon the mirror of that face--but thatthe mirror, mirror-like, retained no vestige of the passion, when thepassion had departed.Upon leaving him on the night of our adventure, he solicited me, inwhat I thought an urgent manner, to call upon him _very_ early thenext morning. Shortly after sunrise, I found myself accordingly at hisPalazzo, one of those huge structures of gloomy, yet fantastic pomp,which tower above the waters of the Grand Canal in the vicinity of theRialto. I was shown up a broad winding staircase of mosaics, into anapartment whose unparalleled splendor burst through the opening doorwith an actual glare, making me blind and dizzy with luxuriousness.I knew my acquaintance to be wealthy. Report had spoken of hispossessions in terms which I had even ventured to call terms ofridiculous exaggeration. But as I gazed about me, I could not bringmyself to believe that the wealth of any subject in Europe could havesupplied the princely magnificence which burned and blazed around.Although, as I say, the sun had arisen, yet the room was stillbrilliantly lighted up. I judge from this circumstance, as well as froman air of exhaustion in the countenance of my friend, that he hadnot retired to bed during the whole of the preceding night. In thearchitecture and embellishments of the chamber, the evident designhad been to dazzle and astound. Little attention had been paid to the_decora_ of what is technically called _keeping_, or to the proprietiesof nationality. The eye wandered from object to object, and rested uponnone--neither the _grotesques_ of the Greek painters, nor the sculpturesof the best Italian days, nor the huge carvings of untutored Egypt. Richdraperies in every part of the room trembled to the vibration of low,melancholy music, whose origin was not to be discovered. The senses wereoppressed by mingled and conflicting perfumes, reeking up from strangeconvolute censers, together with multitudinous flaring and flickeringtongues of emerald and violet fire. The rays of the newly risen sunpoured in upon the whole, through windows, formed each of a single paneof crimson-tinted glass. Glancing to and fro, in a thousand reflections,from curtains which rolled from their cornices like cataracts of moltensilver, the beams of natural glory mingled at length fitfully with theartificial light, and lay weltering in subdued masses upon a carpet ofrich, liquid-looking cloth of Chili gold.&quot;Ha! ha! ha!--ha! ha! ha!&quot;--laughed the proprietor, motioning me toa seat as I entered the room, and throwing himself back at full-lengthupon an ottoman. &quot;I see,&quot; said he, perceiving that I could notimmediately reconcile myself to the _bienseance_ of so singular awelcome--&quot;I see you are astonished at my apartment--at my statues--mypictures--my originality of conception in architecture and upholstery!absolutely drunk, eh, with my magnificence? But pardon me, my dearsir, (here his tone of voice dropped to the very spirit of cordiality,)pardon me for my uncharitable laughter. You appeared so _utterly_astonished. Besides, some things are so completely ludicrous, that a man_must_ laugh or die. To die laughing, must be the most glorious ofall glorious deaths! Sir Thomas More--a very fine man was Sir ThomasMore--Sir Thomas More died laughing, you remember. Also in the_Absurdities_ of Ravisius Textor, there is a long list of characters whocame to the same magnificent end. Do you know, however,&quot; continued hemusingly, &quot;that at Sparta (which is now PalÃ¦; ochori,) at Sparta, I say,to the west of the citadel, among a chaos of scarcely visible ruins, isa kind of _socle_, upon which are still legible the letters _AAEM_. Theyare undoubtedly part of _PEAAEMA_. Now, at Sparta were a thousand templesand shrines to a thousand different divinities. How exceedingly strangethat the altar of Laughter should have survived all the others! But inthe present instance,&quot; he resumed, with a singular alteration of voiceand manner, &quot;I have no right to be merry at your expense. You might wellhave been amazed. Europe cannot produce anything so fine as this, mylittle regal cabinet. My other apartments are by no means of the sameorder--mere _ultras_ of fashionable insipidity. This is better thanfashion--is it not? Yet this has but to be seen to become the rage--thatis, with those who could afford it at the cost of their entirepatrimony. I have guarded, however, against any such profanation.With one exception, you are the only human being besides myself and my_valet_, who has been admitted within the mysteries of these imperialprecincts, since they have been bedizzened as you see!&quot;I bowed in acknowledgment--for the overpowering sense of splendor andperfume, and music, together with the unexpected eccentricity ofhis address and manner, prevented me from expressing, in words, myappreciation of what I might have construed into a compliment.&quot;Here,&quot; he resumed, arising and leaning on my arm as he sauntered aroundthe apartment, &quot;here are paintings from the Greeks to Cimabue, and fromCimabue to the present hour. Many are chosen, as you see, with littledeference to the opinions of Virtu. They are all, however, fittingtapestry for a chamber such as this. Here, too, are some _chefsd'oeuvre_ of the unknown great; and here, unfinished designs by men,celebrated in their day, whose very names the perspicacity of theacademies has left to silence and to me. What think you,&quot; said he,turning abruptly as he spoke--&quot;what think you of this Madonna dellaPieta?&quot;&quot;It is Guido's own!&quot; I said, with all the enthusiasm of my nature, for Ihad been poring intently over its surpassing loveliness. &quot;It is Guido'sown!--how _could_ you have obtained it?--she is undoubtedly in paintingwhat the Venus is in sculpture.&quot;&quot;Ha!&quot; said he thoughtfully, &quot;the Venus--the beautiful Venus?--the Venusof the Medici?--she of the diminutive head and the gilded hair? Part ofthe left arm (here his voice dropped so as to be heard with difficulty,)and all the right, are restorations; and in the coquetry of that rightarm lies, I think, the quintessence of all affectation. Give _me_ theCanova! The Apollo, too, is a copy--there can be no doubt of it--blindfool that I am, who cannot behold the boasted inspiration of the Apollo!I cannot help--pity me!--I cannot help preferring the Antinous. Was itnot Socrates who said that the statuary found his statue in the block ofmarble? Then Michael Angelo was by no means original in his couplet--     'Non ha l'ottimo artista alcun concetto     Che un marmo solo in se non circunscriva.'&quot;It has been, or should be remarked, that, in the manner of the truegentleman, we are always aware of a difference from the bearing of thevulgar, without being at once precisely able to determine in what suchdifference consists. Allowing the remark to have applied in its fullforce to the outward demeanor of my acquaintance, I felt it, on thateventful morning, still more fully applicable to his moral temperamentand character. Nor can I better define that peculiarity of spirit whichseemed to place him so essentially apart from all other human beings,than by calling it a _habit_ of intense and continual thought,pervading even his most trivial actions--intruding upon his momentsof dalliance--and interweaving itself with his very flashes ofmerriment--like adders which writhe from out the eyes of the grinningmasks in the cornices around the temples of Persepolis.I could not help, however, repeatedly observing, through the mingledtone of levity and solemnity with which he rapidly descanted uponmatters of little importance, a certain air of trepidation--a degree ofnervous _unction_ in action and in speech--an unquiet excitability ofmanner which appeared to me at all times unaccountable, and upon someoccasions even filled me with alarm. Frequently, too, pausing in themiddle of a sentence whose commencement he had apparently forgotten,he seemed to be listening in the deepest attention, as if either inmomentary expectation of a visiter, or to sounds which must have hadexistence in his imagination alone.It was during one of these reveries or pauses of apparent abstraction,that, in turning over a page of the poet and scholar Politian'sbeautiful tragedy &quot;The Orfeo,&quot; (the first native Italian tragedy,)which lay near me upon an ottoman, I discovered a passage underlined inpencil. It was a passage towards the end of the third act--a passage ofthe most heart-stirring excitement--a passage which, although taintedwith impurity, no man shall read without a thrill of novel emotion--nowoman without a sigh. The whole page was blotted with fresh tears; and,upon the opposite interleaf, were the following English lines,written in a hand so very different from the peculiar characters of myacquaintance, that I had some difficulty in recognising it as his own:--     Thou wast that all to me, love,     For which my soul did pine--     A green isle in the sea, love,     A fountain and a shrine,     All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers;     And all the flowers were mine.     Ah, dream too bright to last!     Ah, starry Hope, that didst arise     But to be overcast!     A voice from out the Future cries,     &quot;Onward!&quot;--but o'er the Past     (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies,     Mute--motionless--aghast!     For alas!  alas!  with me     The light of life is o'er.     &quot;No more--no more--no more,&quot;     (Such language holds the solemn sea     To the sands upon the shore,)     Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,     Or the stricken eagle soar!     Now all my hours are trances;     And all my nightly dreams     Are where the dark eye glances,     And where thy footstep gleams,     In what ethereal dances,     By what Italian streams.     Alas!  for that accursed time     They bore thee o'er the billow,     From Love to titled age and crime,     And an unholy pillow!--     From me, and from our misty clime,     Where weeps the silver willow!That these lines were written in English--a language with which I hadnot believed their author acquainted--afforded me little matter forsurprise. I was too well aware of the extent of his acquirements, and ofthe singular pleasure he took in concealing them from observation, tobe astonished at any similar discovery; but the place of date, I mustconfess, occasioned me no little amazement. It had been originallywritten _London_, and afterwards carefully overscored--not, however, soeffectually as to conceal the word from a scrutinizing eye. I say, thisoccasioned me no little amazement; for I well remember that, in a formerconversation with a friend, I particularly inquired if he had at anytime met in London the Marchesa di Mentoni, (who for some years previousto her marriage had resided in that city,) when his answer, if I mistakenot, gave me to understand that he had never visited the metropolis ofGreat Britain. I might as well here mention, that I have more thanonce heard, (without, of course, giving credit to a reportinvolving so many improbabilities,) that the person of whom I speak, wasnot only by birth, but in education, an _Englishman_.* * * * *&quot;There is one painting,&quot; said he, without being aware of my notice ofthe tragedy--&quot;there is still one painting which you have not seen.&quot; Andthrowing aside a drapery, he discovered a full-length portrait of theMarchesa Aphrodite. Human art could have done no more in the delineation of hersuperhuman beauty. The same ethereal figure which stood before me thepreceding night upon the steps of the Ducal Palace, stood before me onceagain. But in the expression of the countenance, which was beaming allover with smiles, there still lurked (incomprehensible anomaly!) thatfitful stain of melancholy which will ever be found inseparable from theperfection of the beautiful. Her right arm lay folded over her bosom.With her left she pointed downward to a curiously fashioned vase.One small, fairy foot, alone visible, barely touched the earth; and,scarcely discernible in the brilliant atmosphere which seemed toencircle and enshrine her loveliness, floated a pair of the mostdelicately imagined wings. My glance fell from the painting to thefigure of my friend, and the vigorous words of Chapman's _BussyD'Ambois_, quivered instinctively upon my lips:                     &quot;He is up     There like a Roman statue!  He will stand     Till Death hath made him marble!&quot;&quot;Come,&quot; he said at length, turning towards a table of richly enamelledand massive silver, upon which were a few goblets fantasticallystained, together with two large Etruscan vases, fashioned in the sameextraordinary model as that in the foreground of the portrait, andfilled with what I supposed to be Johannisberger. &quot;Come,&quot; he said,abruptly, &quot;let us drink! It is early--but let us drink. It is _indeed_early,&quot; he continued, musingly, as a cherub with a heavy golden hammermade the apartment ring with the first hour after sunrise: &quot;It is_indeed_ early--but what matters it? let us drink! Let us pour out anoffering to yon solemn sun which these gaudy lamps and censers areso eager to subdue!&quot; And, having made me pledge him in a bumper, heswallowed in rapid succession several goblets of the wine.&quot;To dream,&quot; he continued, resuming the tone of his desultoryconversation, as he held up to the rich light of a censer one of themagnificent vases--&quot;to dream has been the business of my life. I havetherefore framed for myself, as you see, a bower of dreams. In the heartof Venice could I have erected a better? You behold around you, it istrue, a medley of architectural embellishments. The chastity of Ioniais offended by antediluvian devices, and the sphynxes of Egypt areoutstretched upon carpets of gold. Yet the effect is incongruous tothe timid alone. Proprieties of place, and especially of time, arethe bugbears which terrify mankind from the contemplation of themagnificent. Once I was myself a decorist; but that sublimation of follyhas palled upon my soul. All this is now the fitter for my purpose. Likethese arabesque censers, my spirit is writhing in fire, and the deliriumof this scene is fashioning me for the wilder visions of that landof real dreams whither I am now rapidly departing.&quot; He here pausedabruptly, bent his head to his bosom, and seemed to listen to a soundwhich I could not hear. At length, erecting his frame, he lookedupwards, and ejaculated the lines of the Bishop of Chichester:     _&quot;Stay for me there!  I will not fail_     _To meet thee in that hollow vale.&quot;_In the next instant, confessing the power of the wine, he threw himselfat full-length upon an ottoman.A quick step was now heard upon the staircase, and a loud knock atthe door rapidly succeeded. I was hastening to anticipate a seconddisturbance, when a page of Mentoni's household burst into the room, andfaltered out, in a voice choking with emotion, the incoherent words,&quot;My mistress!--my mistress!--Poisoned!--poisoned! Oh, beautiful--oh,beautiful Aphrodite!&quot;Bewildered, I flew to the ottoman, and endeavored to arouse the sleeperto a sense of the startling intelligence. But his limbs were rigid--hislips were livid--his lately beaming eyes were riveted in _death_.I staggered back towards the table--my hand fell upon a cracked andblackened goblet--and a consciousness of the entire and terrible truthflashed suddenly over my soul.THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM     Impia tortorum longos hic turba furores     Sanguinis innocui, non satiata, aluit.     Sospite nunc patria, fracto nunc funeris antro,     Mors ubi dira fuit vita salusque patent.     [_Quatrain composed for the gates of a market to be erected     upon the site of the Jacobin Club House at Paris_.]I WAS sick--sick unto death with that long agony; and when they atlength unbound me, and I was permitted to sit, I felt that my senseswere leaving me. The sentence--the dread sentence of death--was the lastof distinct accentuation which reached my ears. After that, the sound ofthe inquisitorial voices seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminatehum. It conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution--perhaps from itsassociation in fancy with the burr of a mill wheel. This only for abrief period; for presently I heard no more. Yet, for a while, I saw;but with how terrible an exaggeration! I saw the lips of the black-robedjudges. They appeared to me white--whiter than the sheet upon whichI trace these words--and thin even to grotesqueness; thin with theintensity of their expression of firmness--of immoveable resolution--ofstern contempt of human torture. I saw that the decrees of what to mewas Fate, were still issuing from those lips. I saw them writhe witha deadly locution. I saw them fashion the syllables of my name; and Ishuddered because no sound succeeded. I saw, too, for a few moments ofdelirious horror, the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sabledraperies which enwrapped the walls of the apartment. And then my visionfell upon the seven tall candles upon the table. At first they wore theaspect of charity, and seemed white and slender angels who would saveme; but then, all at once, there came a most deadly nausea over myspirit, and I felt every fibre in my frame thrill as if I had touchedthe wire of a galvanic battery, while the angel forms became meaninglessspectres, with heads of flame, and I saw that from them there would beno help. And then there stole into my fancy, like a rich musical note,the thought of what sweet rest there must be in the grave. The thoughtcame gently and stealthily, and it seemed long before it attained fullappreciation; but just as my spirit came at length properly to feel andentertain it, the figures of the judges vanished, as if magically, frombefore me; the tall candles sank into nothingness; their flames went oututterly; the blackness of darkness supervened; all sensations appearedswallowed up in a mad rushing descent as of the soul into Hades. Thensilence, and stillness, night were the universe.I had swooned; but still will not say that all of consciousness waslost. What of it there remained I will not attempt to define, or evento describe; yet all was not lost. In the deepest slumber--no! Indelirium--no! In a swoon--no! In death--no! even in the grave all isnot lost. Else there is no immortality for man. Arousing from the mostprofound of slumbers, we break the gossamer web of some dream. Yet in asecond afterward, (so frail may that web have been) we remember notthat we have dreamed. In the return to life from the swoon there are twostages; first, that of the sense of mental or spiritual; secondly, thatof the sense of physical, existence. It seems probable that if, uponreaching the second stage, we could recall the impressions of thefirst, we should find these impressions eloquent in memories of the gulfbeyond. And that gulf is--what? How at least shall we distinguish itsshadows from those of the tomb? But if the impressions of what I havetermed the first stage, are not, at will, recalled, yet, after longinterval, do they not come unbidden, while we marvel whence they come?He who has never swooned, is not he who finds strange palaces and wildlyfamiliar faces in coals that glow; is not he who beholds floatingin mid-air the sad visions that the many may not view; is not he whoponders over the perfume of some novel flower--is not he whose braingrows bewildered with the meaning of some musical cadence which hasnever before arrested his attention.Amid frequent and thoughtful endeavors to remember; amid earneststruggles to regather some token of the state of seeming nothingnessinto which my soul had lapsed, there have been moments when I havedreamed of success; there have been brief, very brief periods when Ihave conjured up remembrances which the lucid reason of a later epochassures me could have had reference only to that condition of seemingunconsciousness. These shadows of memory tell, indistinctly, of tallfigures that lifted and bore me in silence down--down--stilldown--till a hideous dizziness oppressed me at the mere idea of theinterminableness of the descent. They tell also of a vague horror atmy heart, on account of that heart's unnatural stillness. Then comes asense of sudden motionlessness throughout all things; as if those whobore me (a ghastly train!) had outrun, in their descent, the limits ofthe limitless, and paused from the wearisomeness of their toil. Afterthis I call to mind flatness and dampness; and then all is madness--themadness of a memory which busies itself among forbidden things.Very suddenly there came back to my soul motion and sound--thetumultuous motion of the heart, and, in my ears, the sound of itsbeating. Then a pause in which all is blank. Then again sound, andmotion, and touch--a tingling sensation pervading my frame. Then themere consciousness of existence, without thought--a condition whichlasted long. Then, very suddenly, thought, and shuddering terror, andearnest endeavor to comprehend my true state. Then a strong desireto lapse into insensibility. Then a rushing revival of soul and asuccessful effort to move. And now a full memory of the trial, of thejudges, of the sable draperies, of the sentence, of the sickness, ofthe swoon. Then entire forgetfulness of all that followed; of all thata later day and much earnestness of endeavor have enabled me vaguely torecall.So far, I had not opened my eyes. I felt that I lay upon my back,unbound. I reached out my hand, and it fell heavily upon something dampand hard. There I suffered it to remain for many minutes, while I stroveto imagine where and what I could be. I longed, yet dared not to employmy vision. I dreaded the first glance at objects around me. It was notthat I feared to look upon things horrible, but that I grew aghast lestthere should be nothing to see. At length, with a wild desperationat heart, I quickly unclosed my eyes. My worst thoughts, then, wereconfirmed. The blackness of eternal night encompassed me. I struggledfor breath. The intensity of the darkness seemed to oppress and stifleme. The atmosphere was intolerably close. I still lay quietly, andmade effort to exercise my reason. I brought to mind the inquisitorialproceedings, and attempted from that point to deduce my real condition.The sentence had passed; and it appeared to me that a very long intervalof time had since elapsed. Yet not for a moment did I suppose myselfactually dead. Such a supposition, notwithstanding what we read infiction, is altogether inconsistent with real existence;--but where andin what state was I? The condemned to death, I knew, perished usually atthe autos-da-fe, and one of these had been held on the very night of theday of my trial. Had I been remanded to my dungeon, to await the nextsacrifice, which would not take place for many months? This I at oncesaw could not be. Victims had been in immediate demand. Moreover, mydungeon, as well as all the condemned cells at Toledo, had stone floors,and light was not altogether excluded.A fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my heart,and for a brief period, I once more relapsed into insensibility. Uponrecovering, I at once started to my feet, trembling convulsivelyin every fibre. I thrust my arms wildly above and around me in alldirections. I felt nothing; yet dreaded to move a step, lest I should beimpeded by the walls of a tomb. Perspiration burst from every pore, andstood in cold big beads upon my forehead. The agony of suspense grewat length intolerable, and I cautiously moved forward, with my armsextended, and my eyes straining from their sockets, in the hope ofcatching some faint ray of light. I proceeded for many paces; but stillall was blackness and vacancy. I breathed more freely. It seemed evidentthat mine was not, at least, the most hideous of fates.And now, as I still continued to step cautiously onward, there camethronging upon my recollection a thousand vague rumors of the horrors ofToledo. Of the dungeons there had been strange things narrated--fables Ihad always deemed them--but yet strange, and too ghastly to repeat, savein a whisper. Was I left to perish of starvation in this subterraneanworld of darkness; or what fate, perhaps even more fearful, awaitedme? That the result would be death, and a death of more than customarybitterness, I knew too well the character of my judges to doubt. Themode and the hour were all that occupied or distracted me.My outstretched hands at length encountered some solid obstruction. Itwas a wall, seemingly of stone masonry--very smooth, slimy, and cold.I followed it up; stepping with all the careful distrust with whichcertain antique narratives had inspired me. This process, however,afforded me no means of ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon; asI might make its circuit, and return to the point whence I set out,without being aware of the fact; so perfectly uniform seemed the wall.I therefore sought the knife which had been in my pocket, when ledinto the inquisitorial chamber; but it was gone; my clothes had beenexchanged for a wrapper of coarse serge. I had thought of forcing theblade in some minute crevice of the masonry, so as to identify my pointof departure. The difficulty, nevertheless, was but trivial; although,in the disorder of my fancy, it seemed at first insuperable. I tore apart of the hem from the robe and placed the fragment at full length,and at right angles to the wall. In groping my way around the prison, Icould not fail to encounter this rag upon completing the circuit. So, atleast I thought: but I had not counted upon the extent of the dungeon,or upon my own weakness. The ground was moist and slippery. I staggeredonward for some time, when I stumbled and fell. My excessive fatigueinduced me to remain prostrate; and sleep soon overtook me as I lay.Upon awaking, and stretching forth an arm, I found beside me a loafand a pitcher with water. I was too much exhausted to reflect uponthis circumstance, but ate and drank with avidity. Shortly afterward, Iresumed my tour around the prison, and with much toil came at last uponthe fragment of the serge. Up to the period when I fell I had countedfifty-two paces, and upon resuming my walk, I had counted forty-eightmore;--when I arrived at the rag. There were in all, then, a hundredpaces; and, admitting two paces to the yard, I presumed the dungeon tobe fifty yards in circuit. I had met, however, with many angles in thewall, and thus I could form no guess at the shape of the vault; forvault I could not help supposing it to be.I had little object--certainly no hope--in these researches; but a vaguecuriosity prompted me to continue them. Quitting the wall, I resolvedto cross the area of the enclosure. At first I proceeded with extremecaution, for the floor, although seemingly of solid material, wastreacherous with slime. At length, however, I took courage, and did nothesitate to step firmly; endeavoring to cross in as direct a line aspossible. I had advanced some ten or twelve paces in this manner, whenthe remnant of the torn hem of my robe became entangled between my legs.I stepped on it, and fell violently on my face.In the confusion attending my fall, I did not immediately apprehend asomewhat startling circumstance, which yet, in a few seconds afterward,and while I still lay prostrate, arrested my attention. It was this--mychin rested upon the floor of the prison, but my lips and the upperportion of my head, although seemingly at a less elevation than thechin, touched nothing. At the same time my forehead seemed bathed ina clammy vapor, and the peculiar smell of decayed fungus arose to mynostrils. I put forward my arm, and shuddered to find that I had fallenat the very brink of a circular pit, whose extent, of course, I hadno means of ascertaining at the moment. Groping about the masonry justbelow the margin, I succeeded in dislodging a small fragment, and let itfall into the abyss. For many seconds I hearkened to its reverberationsas it dashed against the sides of the chasm in its descent; at lengththere was a sullen plunge into water, succeeded by loud echoes. At thesame moment there came a sound resembling the quick opening, and asrapid closing of a door overhead, while a faint gleam of light flashedsuddenly through the gloom, and as suddenly faded away.I saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for me, and congratulatedmyself upon the timely accident by which I had escaped. Another stepbefore my fall, and the world had seen me no more. And the death justavoided, was of that very character which I had regarded as fabulous andfrivolous in the tales respecting the Inquisition. To the victims of itstyranny, there was the choice of death with its direst physical agonies,or death with its most hideous moral horrors. I had been reserved forthe latter. By long suffering my nerves had been unstrung, until Itrembled at the sound of my own voice, and had become in every respect afitting subject for the species of torture which awaited me.Shaking in every limb, I groped my way back to the wall; resolvingthere to perish rather than risk the terrors of the wells, of which myimagination now pictured many in various positions about the dungeon.In other conditions of mind I might have had courage to end my misery atonce by a plunge into one of these abysses; but now I was the veriest ofcowards. Neither could I forget what I had read of these pits--that thesudden extinction of life formed no part of their most horrible plan.Agitation of spirit kept me awake for many long hours; but at length Iagain slumbered. Upon arousing, I found by my side, as before, a loafand a pitcher of water. A burning thirst consumed me, and I emptiedthe vessel at a draught. It must have been drugged; for scarcely had Idrunk, before I became irresistibly drowsy. A deep sleep fell upon me--asleep like that of death. How long it lasted of course, I know not;but when, once again, I unclosed my eyes, the objects around me werevisible. By a wild sulphurous lustre, the origin of which I could notat first determine, I was enabled to see the extent and aspect of theprison.In its size I had been greatly mistaken. The whole circuit of its wallsdid not exceed twenty-five yards. For some minutes this fact occasionedme a world of vain trouble; vain indeed! for what could be of lessimportance, under the terrible circumstances which environed me, thenthe mere dimensions of my dungeon? But my soul took a wild interest intrifles, and I busied myself in endeavors to account for the error I hadcommitted in my measurement. The truth at length flashed upon me. In myfirst attempt at exploration I had counted fifty-two paces, up to theperiod when I fell; I must then have been within a pace or two of thefragment of serge; in fact, I had nearly performed the circuit of thevault. I then slept, and upon awaking, I must have returned upon mysteps--thus supposing the circuit nearly double what it actually was. Myconfusion of mind prevented me from observing that I began my tour withthe wall to the left, and ended it with the wall to the right.I had been deceived, too, in respect to the shape of the enclosure.In feeling my way I had found many angles, and thus deduced an idea ofgreat irregularity; so potent is the effect of total darkness upon onearousing from lethargy or sleep! The angles were simply those of a fewslight depressions, or niches, at odd intervals. The general shape ofthe prison was square. What I had taken for masonry seemed now to beiron, or some other metal, in huge plates, whose sutures or jointsoccasioned the depression. The entire surface of this metallic enclosurewas rudely daubed in all the hideous and repulsive devices to which thecharnel superstition of the monks has given rise. The figures of fiendsin aspects of menace, with skeleton forms, and other more reallyfearful images, overspread and disfigured the walls. I observed that theoutlines of these monstrosities were sufficiently distinct, but thatthe colors seemed faded and blurred, as if from the effects of a dampatmosphere. I now noticed the floor, too, which was of stone. In thecentre yawned the circular pit from whose jaws I had escaped; but it wasthe only one in the dungeon.All this I saw indistinctly and by much effort: for my personalcondition had been greatly changed during slumber. I now lay upon myback, and at full length, on a species of low framework of wood. To thisI was securely bound by a long strap resembling a surcingle. It passedin many convolutions about my limbs and body, leaving at liberty onlymy head, and my left arm to such extent that I could, by dint of muchexertion, supply myself with food from an earthen dish which lay bymy side on the floor. I saw, to my horror, that the pitcher had beenremoved. I say to my horror; for I was consumed with intolerable thirst.This thirst it appeared to be the design of my persecutors to stimulate:for the food in the dish was meat pungently seasoned.Looking upward, I surveyed the ceiling of my prison. It was some thirtyor forty feet overhead, and constructed much as the side walls. In oneof its panels a very singular figure riveted my whole attention. It wasthe painted figure of Time as he is commonly represented, save that, inlieu of a scythe, he held what, at a casual glance, I supposed to bethe pictured image of a huge pendulum such as we see on antique clocks.There was something, however, in the appearance of this machine whichcaused me to regard it more attentively. While I gazed directly upwardat it (for its position was immediately over my own) I fancied that Isaw it in motion. In an instant afterward the fancy was confirmed. Itssweep was brief, and of course slow. I watched it for some minutes,somewhat in fear, but more in wonder. Wearied at length with observingits dull movement, I turned my eyes upon the other objects in the cell.A slight noise attracted my notice, and, looking to the floor, I sawseveral enormous rats traversing it. They had issued from the well,which lay just within view to my right. Even then, while I gazed, theycame up in troops, hurriedly, with ravenous eyes, allured by the scentof the meat. From this it required much effort and attention to scarethem away.It might have been half an hour, perhaps even an hour, (for I could takebut imperfect note of time) before I again cast my eyes upward. WhatI then saw confounded and amazed me. The sweep of the pendulum hadincreased in extent by nearly a yard. As a natural consequence, itsvelocity was also much greater. But what mainly disturbed me was theidea that had perceptibly descended. I now observed--with what horror itis needless to say--that its nether extremity was formed of a crescentof glittering steel, about a foot in length from horn to horn; the hornsupward, and the under edge evidently as keen as that of a razor. Likea razor also, it seemed massy and heavy, tapering from the edge intoa solid and broad structure above. It was appended to a weighty rod ofbrass, and the whole hissed as it swung through the air.I could no longer doubt the doom prepared for me by monkish ingenuity intorture. My cognizance of the pit had become known to the inquisitorialagents--the pit whose horrors had been destined for so bold a recusantas myself--the pit, typical of hell, and regarded by rumor as the UltimaThule of all their punishments. The plunge into this pit I had avoidedby the merest of accidents, I knew that surprise, or entrapment intotorment, formed an important portion of all the grotesquerie of thesedungeon deaths. Having failed to fall, it was no part of the demonplan to hurl me into the abyss; and thus (there being no alternative) adifferent and a milder destruction awaited me. Milder! I half smiled inmy agony as I thought of such application of such a term.What boots it to tell of the long, long hours of horror more thanmortal, during which I counted the rushing vibrations of the steel! Inchby inch--line by line--with a descent only appreciable at intervals thatseemed ages--down and still down it came! Days passed--it might havebeen that many days passed--ere it swept so closely over me as to fan mewith its acrid breath. The odor of the sharp steel forced itself into mynostrils. I prayed--I wearied heaven with my prayer for its more speedydescent. I grew frantically mad, and struggled to force myself upwardagainst the sweep of the fearful scimitar. And then I fell suddenlycalm, and lay smiling at the glittering death, as a child at some rarebauble.There was another interval of utter insensibility; it was brief; for,upon again lapsing into life there had been no perceptible descent inthe pendulum. But it might have been long; for I knew there were demonswho took note of my swoon, and who could have arrested the vibration atpleasure. Upon my recovery, too, I felt very--oh, inexpressibly sickand weak, as if through long inanition. Even amid the agonies of thatperiod, the human nature craved food. With painful effort I outstretchedmy left arm as far as my bonds permitted, and took possession of thesmall remnant which had been spared me by the rats. As I put a portionof it within my lips, there rushed to my mind a half formed thought ofjoy--of hope. Yet what business had I with hope? It was, as I say, ahalf formed thought--man has many such which are never completed. I feltthat it was of joy--of hope; but felt also that it had perished in itsformation. In vain I struggled to perfect--to regain it. Long sufferinghad nearly annihilated all my ordinary powers of mind. I was animbecile--an idiot.The vibration of the pendulum was at right angles to my length. I sawthat the crescent was designed to cross the region of the heart.It would fray the serge of my robe--it would return and repeat itsoperations--again--and again. Notwithstanding terrifically wide sweep(some thirty feet or more) and the hissing vigor of its descent,sufficient to sunder these very walls of iron, still the fraying of myrobe would be all that, for several minutes, it would accomplish. Andat this thought I paused. I dared not go farther than this reflection. Idwelt upon it with a pertinacity of attention--as if, in so dwelling,I could arrest here the descent of the steel. I forced myself toponder upon the sound of the crescent as it should pass across thegarment--upon the peculiar thrilling sensation which the friction ofcloth produces on the nerves. I pondered upon all this frivolity untilmy teeth were on edge.Down--steadily down it crept. I took a frenzied pleasure in contrastingits downward with its lateral velocity. To the right--to the left--farand wide--with the shriek of a damned spirit; to my heart with thestealthy pace of the tiger! I alternately laughed and howled as the oneor the other idea grew predominant.Down--certainly, relentlessly down! It vibrated within three inches ofmy bosom! I struggled violently, furiously, to free my left arm. Thiswas free only from the elbow to the hand. I could reach the latter, fromthe platter beside me, to my mouth, with great effort, but no farther.Could I have broken the fastenings above the elbow, I would have seizedand attempted to arrest the pendulum. I might as well have attempted toarrest an avalanche!Down--still unceasingly--still inevitably down! I gasped and struggledat each vibration. I shrunk convulsively at its every sweep. My eyesfollowed its outward or upward whirls with the eagerness of the mostunmeaning despair; they closed themselves spasmodically at the descent,although death would have been a relief, oh! how unspeakable! Still Iquivered in every nerve to think how slight a sinking of the machinerywould precipitate that keen, glistening axe upon my bosom. It was hopethat prompted the nerve to quiver--the frame to shrink. It was hope--thehope that triumphs on the rack--that whispers to the death-condemnedeven in the dungeons of the Inquisition.I saw that some ten or twelve vibrations would bring the steel in actualcontact with my robe, and with this observation there suddenly came overmy spirit all the keen, collected calmness of despair. For the firsttime during many hours--or perhaps days--I thought. It now occurred tome that the bandage, or surcingle, which enveloped me, was unique. Iwas tied by no separate cord. The first stroke of the razorlike crescentathwart any portion of the band, would so detach it that it might beunwound from my person by means of my left hand. But how fearful, inthat case, the proximity of the steel! The result of the slighteststruggle how deadly! Was it likely, moreover, that the minions of thetorturer had not foreseen and provided for this possibility! Was itprobable that the bandage crossed my bosom in the track of the pendulum?Dreading to find my faint, and, as it seemed, my last hope frustrated,I so far elevated my head as to obtain a distinct view of my breast. Thesurcingle enveloped my limbs and body close in all directions--save inthe path of the destroying crescent.Scarcely had I dropped my head back into its original position, whenthere flashed upon my mind what I cannot better describe than as theunformed half of that idea of deliverance to which I have previouslyalluded, and of which a moiety only floated indeterminately through mybrain when I raised food to my burning lips. The whole thought was nowpresent--feeble, scarcely sane, scarcely definite,--but still entire.I proceeded at once, with the nervous energy of despair, to attempt itsexecution.For many hours the immediate vicinity of the low framework upon whichI lay, had been literally swarming with rats. They were wild, bold,ravenous; their red eyes glaring upon me as if they waited but formotionlessness on my part to make me their prey. &quot;To what food,&quot; Ithought, &quot;have they been accustomed in the well?&quot;They had devoured, in spite of all my efforts to prevent them, all but asmall remnant of the contents of the dish. I had fallen into an habitualsee-saw, or wave of the hand about the platter: and, at length, theunconscious uniformity of the movement deprived it of effect. In theirvoracity the vermin frequently fastened their sharp fangs in my fingers.With the particles of the oily and spicy viand which now remained, Ithoroughly rubbed the bandage wherever I could reach it; then, raisingmy hand from the floor, I lay breathlessly still.At first the ravenous animals were startled and terrified at thechange--at the cessation of movement. They shrank alarmedly back; manysought the well. But this was only for a moment. I had not counted invain upon their voracity. Observing that I remained without motion,one or two of the boldest leaped upon the frame-work, and smelt at thesurcingle. This seemed the signal for a general rush. Forth from thewell they hurried in fresh troops. They clung to the wood--they overranit, and leaped in hundreds upon my person. The measured movement of thependulum disturbed them not at all. Avoiding its strokes they busiedthemselves with the anointed bandage. They pressed--they swarmed upon mein ever accumulating heaps. They writhed upon my throat; their cold lipssought my own; I was half stifled by their thronging pressure; disgust,for which the world has no name, swelled my bosom, and chilled, with aheavy clamminess, my heart. Yet one minute, and I felt that the strugglewould be over. Plainly I perceived the loosening of the bandage. I knewthat in more than one place it must be already severed. With a more thanhuman resolution I lay still.Nor had I erred in my calculations--nor had I endured in vain. I atlength felt that I was free. The surcingle hung in ribands from my body.But the stroke of the pendulum already pressed upon my bosom. It haddivided the serge of the robe. It had cut through the linen beneath.Twice again it swung, and a sharp sense of pain shot through everynerve. But the moment of escape had arrived. At a wave of my hand mydeliverers hurried tumultuously away. With a steady movement--cautious,sidelong, shrinking, and slow--I slid from the embrace of the bandageand beyond the reach of the scimitar. For the moment, at least, I wasfree.Free!--and in the grasp of the Inquisition! I had scarcely stepped frommy wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the prison, when themotion of the hellish machine ceased and I beheld it drawn up, by someinvisible force, through the ceiling. This was a lesson which I tookdesperately to heart. My every motion was undoubtedly watched. Free!--Ihad but escaped death in one form of agony, to be delivered unto worsethan death in some other. With that thought I rolled my evesnervously around on the barriers of iron that hemmed me in. Somethingunusual--some change which, at first, I could not appreciatedistinctly--it was obvious, had taken place in the apartment. For manyminutes of a dreamy and trembling abstraction, I busied myself in vain,unconnected conjecture. During this period, I became aware, for thefirst time, of the origin of the sulphurous light which illuminedthe cell. It proceeded from a fissure, about half an inch in width,extending entirely around the prison at the base of the walls, whichthus appeared, and were, completely separated from the floor. Iendeavored, but of course in vain, to look through the aperture.As I arose from the attempt, the mystery of the alteration in thechamber broke at once upon my understanding. I have observed that,although the outlines of the figures upon the walls were sufficientlydistinct, yet the colors seemed blurred and indefinite. These colors hadnow assumed, and were momentarily assuming, a startling and most intensebrilliancy, that gave to the spectral and fiendish portraitures anaspect that might have thrilled even firmer nerves than my own. Demoneyes, of a wild and ghastly vivacity, glared upon me in a thousanddirections, where none had been visible before, and gleamed with thelurid lustre of a fire that I could not force my imagination to regardas unreal.Unreal!--Even while I breathed there came to my nostrils the breath ofthe vapour of heated iron! A suffocating odour pervaded the prison! Adeeper glow settled each moment in the eyes that glared at my agonies!A richer tint of crimson diffused itself over the pictured horrors ofblood. I panted! I gasped for breath! There could be no doubt of thedesign of my tormentors--oh! most unrelenting! oh! most demoniac ofmen! I shrank from the glowing metal to the centre of the cell. Amid thethought of the fiery destruction that impended, the idea of the coolnessof the well came over my soul like balm. I rushed to its deadly brink.I threw my straining vision below. The glare from the enkindled roofillumined its inmost recesses. Yet, for a wild moment, did my spiritrefuse to comprehend the meaning of what I saw. At length it forced--itwrestled its way into my soul--it burned itself in upon my shudderingreason.--Oh! for a voice to speak!--oh! horror!--oh! any horror butthis! With a shriek, I rushed from the margin, and buried my face in myhands--weeping bitterly.The heat rapidly increased, and once again I looked up, shuddering aswith a fit of the ague. There had been a second change in the cell--andnow the change was obviously in the form. As before, it was in vain thatI, at first, endeavoured to appreciate or understand what was takingplace. But not long was I left in doubt. The Inquisitorial vengeance hadbeen hurried by my two-fold escape, and there was to be no more dallyingwith the King of Terrors. The room had been square. I saw that two ofits iron angles were now acute--two, consequently, obtuse. The fearfuldifference quickly increased with a low rumbling or moaning sound. In aninstant the apartment had shifted its form into that of a lozenge. Butthe alteration stopped not here-I neither hoped nor desired it to stop.I could have clasped the red walls to my bosom as a garment of eternalpeace. &quot;Death,&quot; I said, &quot;any death but that of the pit!&quot; Fool! might Ihave not known that into the pit it was the object of the burning ironto urge me? Could I resist its glow? or, if even that, could I withstandits pressure? And now, flatter and flatter grew the lozenge, with arapidity that left me no time for contemplation. Its centre, and ofcourse, its greatest width, came just over the yawning gulf. I shrankback--but the closing walls pressed me resistlessly onward. At lengthfor my seared and writhing body there was no longer an inch of footholdon the firm floor of the prison. I struggled no more, but the agony ofmy soul found vent in one loud, long, and final scream of despair. Ifelt that I tottered upon the brink--I averted my eyes--There was a discordant hum of human voices! There was a loud blast as ofmany trumpets! There was a harsh grating as of a thousand thunders! Thefiery walls rushed back! An outstretched arm caught my own as I fell,fainting, into the abyss. It was that of General Lasalle. The Frencharmy had entered Toledo. The Inquisition was in the hands of itsenemies.THE PREMATURE BURIALTHERE are certain themes of which the interest is all-absorbing, butwhich are too entirely horrible for the purposes of legitimate fiction.These the mere romanticist must eschew, if he do not wish to offend orto disgust. They are with propriety handled only when the severity andmajesty of Truth sanctify and sustain them. We thrill, for example, withthe most intense of &quot;pleasurable pain&quot; over the accounts of the Passageof the Beresina, of the Earthquake at Lisbon, of the Plague at London,of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, or of the stifling of the hundredand twenty-three prisoners in the Black Hole at Calcutta. But in theseaccounts it is the fact----it is the reality----it is the history whichexcites. As inventions, we should regard them with simple abhorrence.I have mentioned some few of the more prominent and august calamitieson record; but in these it is the extent, not less than the characterof the calamity, which so vividly impresses the fancy. I need not remindthe reader that, from the long and weird catalogue of human miseries,I might have selected many individual instances more replete withessential suffering than any of these vast generalities of disaster.The true wretchedness, indeed--the ultimate woe----is particular, notdiffuse. That the ghastly extremes of agony are endured by man the unit,and never by man the mass----for this let us thank a merciful God!To be buried while alive is, beyond question, the most terrific of theseextremes which has ever fallen to the lot of mere mortality. That it hasfrequently, very frequently, so fallen will scarcely be denied by thosewho think. The boundaries which divide Life from Death are at bestshadowy and vague. Who shall say where the one ends, and where the otherbegins? We know that there are diseases in which occur total cessationsof all the apparent functions of vitality, and yet in which thesecessations are merely suspensions, properly so called. They are onlytemporary pauses in the incomprehensible mechanism. A certain periodelapses, and some unseen mysterious principle again sets in motion themagic pinions and the wizard wheels. The silver cord was not for everloosed, nor the golden bowl irreparably broken. But where, meantime, wasthe soul?Apart, however, from the inevitable conclusion, a priori that suchcauses must produce such effects----that the well-known occurrence ofsuch cases of suspended animation must naturally give rise, now andthen, to premature interments--apart from this consideration, we havethe direct testimony of medical and ordinary experience to prove that avast number of such interments have actually taken place. I might referat once, if necessary to a hundred well authenticated instances. One ofvery remarkable character, and of which the circumstances may be freshin the memory of some of my readers, occurred, not very long ago, in theneighboring city of Baltimore, where it occasioned a painful, intense,and widely-extended excitement. The wife of one of the most respectablecitizens--a lawyer of eminence and a member of Congress--was seized witha sudden and unaccountable illness, which completely baffled the skillof her physicians. After much suffering she died, or was supposed todie. No one suspected, indeed, or had reason to suspect, that she wasnot actually dead. She presented all the ordinary appearances of death.The face assumed the usual pinched and sunken outline. The lips were ofthe usual marble pallor. The eyes were lustreless. There was no warmth.Pulsation had ceased. For three days the body was preserved unburied,during which it had acquired a stony rigidity. The funeral, in short,was hastened, on account of the rapid advance of what was supposed to bedecomposition.The lady was deposited in her family vault, which, for three subsequentyears, was undisturbed. At the expiration of this term it was openedfor the reception of a sarcophagus;----but, alas! how fearful a shockawaited the husband, who, personally, threw open the door! As itsportals swung outwardly back, some white-apparelled object fell rattlingwithin his arms. It was the skeleton of his wife in her yet unmouldedshroud.A careful investigation rendered it evident that she had revived withintwo days after her entombment; that her struggles within the coffin hadcaused it to fall from a ledge, or shelf to the floor, where it was sobroken as to permit her escape. A lamp which had been accidentallyleft, full of oil, within the tomb, was found empty; it might have beenexhausted, however, by evaporation. On the uttermost of the steps whichled down into the dread chamber was a large fragment of the coffin,with which, it seemed, that she had endeavored to arrest attention bystriking the iron door. While thus occupied, she probably swooned, orpossibly died, through sheer terror; and, in failing, her shroud becameentangled in some iron--work which projected interiorly. Thus sheremained, and thus she rotted, erect.In the year 1810, a case of living inhumation happened in France,attended with circumstances which go far to warrant the assertion thattruth is, indeed, stranger than fiction. The heroine of the story was aMademoiselle Victorine Lafourcade, a young girl of illustrious family,of wealth, and of great personal beauty. Among her numerous suitors wasJulien Bossuet, a poor litterateur, or journalist of Paris. His talentsand general amiability had recommended him to the notice of the heiress,by whom he seems to have been truly beloved; but her pride of birthdecided her, finally, to reject him, and to wed a Monsieur Renelle, abanker and a diplomatist of some eminence. After marriage, however, thisgentleman neglected, and, perhaps, even more positively ill-treated her.Having passed with him some wretched years, she died,----at least hercondition so closely resembled death as to deceive every one who sawher. She was buried----not in a vault, but in an ordinary grave in thevillage of her nativity. Filled with despair, and still inflamed by thememory of a profound attachment, the lover journeys from the capital tothe remote province in which the village lies, with the romantic purposeof disinterring the corpse, and possessing himself of its luxurianttresses. He reaches the grave. At midnight he unearths the coffin, opensit, and is in the act of detaching the hair, when he is arrested by theunclosing of the beloved eyes. In fact, the lady had been buriedalive. Vitality had not altogether departed, and she was aroused bythe caresses of her lover from the lethargy which had been mistakenfor death. He bore her frantically to his lodgings in the village. Heemployed certain powerful restoratives suggested by no little medicallearning. In fine, she revived. She recognized her preserver. Sheremained with him until, by slow degrees, she fully recovered heroriginal health. Her woman's heart was not adamant, and this lastlesson of love sufficed to soften it. She bestowed it upon Bossuet.She returned no more to her husband, but, concealing from him herresurrection, fled with her lover to America. Twenty years afterward,the two returned to France, in the persuasion that time had so greatlyaltered the lady's appearance that her friends would be unable torecognize her. They were mistaken, however, for, at the first meeting,Monsieur Renelle did actually recognize and make claim to his wife.This claim she resisted, and a judicial tribunal sustained her in herresistance, deciding that the peculiar circumstances, with the longlapse of years, had extinguished, not only equitably, but legally, theauthority of the husband.The &quot;Chirurgical Journal&quot; of Leipsic--a periodical of high authorityand merit, which some American bookseller would do well to translateand republish, records in a late number a very distressing event of thecharacter in question.An officer of artillery, a man of gigantic stature and of robusthealth, being thrown from an unmanageable horse, received a very severecontusion upon the head, which rendered him insensible at once; theskull was slightly fractured, but no immediate danger was apprehended.Trepanning was accomplished successfully. He was bled, and many other ofthe ordinary means of relief were adopted. Gradually, however, he fellinto a more and more hopeless state of stupor, and, finally, it wasthought that he died.The weather was warm, and he was buried with indecent haste in one ofthe public cemeteries. His funeral took place on Thursday. On the Sundayfollowing, the grounds of the cemetery were, as usual, much throngedwith visiters, and about noon an intense excitement was created bythe declaration of a peasant that, while sitting upon the grave ofthe officer, he had distinctly felt a commotion of the earth, as ifoccasioned by some one struggling beneath. At first little attention waspaid to the man's asseveration; but his evident terror, and the doggedobstinacy with which he persisted in his story, had at length theirnatural effect upon the crowd. Spades were hurriedly procured, and thegrave, which was shamefully shallow, was in a few minutes so far thrownopen that the head of its occupant appeared. He was then seemingly dead;but he sat nearly erect within his coffin, the lid of which, in hisfurious struggles, he had partially uplifted.He was forthwith conveyed to the nearest hospital, and there pronouncedto be still living, although in an asphytic condition. After some hourshe revived, recognized individuals of his acquaintance, and, in brokensentences spoke of his agonies in the grave.From what he related, it was clear that he must have been consciousof life for more than an hour, while inhumed, before lapsing intoinsensibility. The grave was carelessly and loosely filled with anexceedingly porous soil; and thus some air was necessarily admitted.He heard the footsteps of the crowd overhead, and endeavored to makehimself heard in turn. It was the tumult within the grounds of thecemetery, he said, which appeared to awaken him from a deep sleep, butno sooner was he awake than he became fully aware of the awful horrorsof his position.This patient, it is recorded, was doing well and seemed to be in a fairway of ultimate recovery, but fell a victim to the quackeries of medicalexperiment. The galvanic battery was applied, and he suddenly expired inone of those ecstatic paroxysms which, occasionally, it superinduces.The mention of the galvanic battery, nevertheless, recalls to my memorya well known and very extraordinary case in point, where its actionproved the means of restoring to animation a young attorney of London,who had been interred for two days. This occurred in 1831, and created,at the time, a very profound sensation wherever it was made the subjectof converse.The patient, Mr. Edward Stapleton, had died, apparently of typhus fever,accompanied with some anomalous symptoms which had excited the curiosityof his medical attendants. Upon his seeming decease, his friends wererequested to sanction a post-mortem examination, but declined to permitit. As often happens, when such refusals are made, the practitionersresolved to disinter the body and dissect it at leisure, in private.Arrangements were easily effected with some of the numerous corps ofbody-snatchers, with which London abounds; and, upon the third nightafter the funeral, the supposed corpse was unearthed from a grave eightfeet deep, and deposited in the opening chamber of one of the privatehospitals.An incision of some extent had been actually made in the abdomen,when the fresh and undecayed appearance of the subject suggested anapplication of the battery. One experiment succeeded another, and thecustomary effects supervened, with nothing to characterize them in anyrespect, except, upon one or two occasions, a more than ordinary degreeof life-likeness in the convulsive action.It grew late. The day was about to dawn; and it was thought expedient,at length, to proceed at once to the dissection. A student, however, wasespecially desirous of testing a theory of his own, and insisted uponapplying the battery to one of the pectoral muscles. A rough gash wasmade, and a wire hastily brought in contact, when the patient, with ahurried but quite unconvulsive movement, arose from the table, steppedinto the middle of the floor, gazed about him uneasily for a fewseconds, and then--spoke. What he said was unintelligible, but wordswere uttered; the syllabification was distinct. Having spoken, he fellheavily to the floor.For some moments all were paralyzed with awe--but the urgency of thecase soon restored them their presence of mind. It was seen that Mr.Stapleton was alive, although in a swoon. Upon exhibition of ether herevived and was rapidly restored to health, and to the society of hisfriends--from whom, however, all knowledge of his resuscitation waswithheld, until a relapse was no longer to be apprehended. Theirwonder--their rapturous astonishment--may be conceived.The most thrilling peculiarity of this incident, nevertheless, isinvolved in what Mr. S. himself asserts. He declares that at no periodwas he altogether insensible--that, dully and confusedly, he was awareof everything which happened to him, from the moment in which he waspronounced dead by his physicians, to that in which he fell swooning tothe floor of the hospital. &quot;I am alive,&quot; were the uncomprehended wordswhich, upon recognizing the locality of the dissecting-room, he hadendeavored, in his extremity, to utter.It were an easy matter to multiply such histories as these--but Iforbear--for, indeed, we have no need of such to establish the fact thatpremature interments occur. When we reflect how very rarely, from thenature of the case, we have it in our power to detect them, we mustadmit that they may frequently occur without our cognizance. Scarcely,in truth, is a graveyard ever encroached upon, for any purpose, to anygreat extent, that skeletons are not found in postures which suggest themost fearful of suspicions.Fearful indeed the suspicion--but more fearful the doom! It may beasserted, without hesitation, that no event is so terribly well adaptedto inspire the supremeness of bodily and of mental distress, as isburial before death. The unendurable oppression of the lungs--thestifling fumes from the damp earth--the clinging to the deathgarments--the rigid embrace of the narrow house--the blackness of theabsolute Night--the silence like a sea that overwhelms--the unseen butpalpable presence of the Conqueror Worm--these things, with the thoughtsof the air and grass above, with memory of dear friends who would fly tosave us if but informed of our fate, and with consciousness that of thisfate they can never be informed--that our hopeless portion is that ofthe really dead--these considerations, I say, carry into the heart,which still palpitates, a degree of appalling and intolerable horrorfrom which the most daring imagination must recoil. We know of nothingso agonizing upon Earth--we can dream of nothing half so hideous in therealms of the nethermost Hell. And thus all narratives upon this topichave an interest profound; an interest, nevertheless, which, throughthe sacred awe of the topic itself, very properly and very peculiarlydepends upon our conviction of the truth of the matter narrated. What Ihave now to tell is of my own actual knowledge--of my own positive andpersonal experience.For several years I had been subject to attacks of the singular disorderwhich physicians have agreed to term catalepsy, in default of a moredefinitive title. Although both the immediate and the predisposingcauses, and even the actual diagnosis, of this disease are stillmysterious, its obvious and apparent character is sufficiently wellunderstood. Its variations seem to be chiefly of degree. Sometimes thepatient lies, for a day only, or even for a shorter period, in a speciesof exaggerated lethargy. He is senseless and externally motionless; butthe pulsation of the heart is still faintly perceptible; some traces ofwarmth remain; a slight color lingers within the centre of the cheek;and, upon application of a mirror to the lips, we can detect a torpid,unequal, and vacillating action of the lungs. Then again the durationof the trance is for weeks--even for months; while the closest scrutiny,and the most rigorous medical tests, fail to establish any materialdistinction between the state of the sufferer and what we conceive ofabsolute death. Very usually he is saved from premature interment solelyby the knowledge of his friends that he has been previously subject tocatalepsy, by the consequent suspicion excited, and, above all, bythe non-appearance of decay. The advances of the malady are, luckily,gradual. The first manifestations, although marked, are unequivocal. Thefits grow successively more and more distinctive, and endure each for alonger term than the preceding. In this lies the principal security frominhumation. The unfortunate whose first attack should be of the extremecharacter which is occasionally seen, would almost inevitably beconsigned alive to the tomb.My own case differed in no important particular from those mentioned inmedical books. Sometimes, without any apparent cause, I sank, little bylittle, into a condition of hemi-syncope, or half swoon; and, in thiscondition, without pain, without ability to stir, or, strictly speaking,to think, but with a dull lethargic consciousness of life and of thepresence of those who surrounded my bed, I remained, until the crisis ofthe disease restored me, suddenly, to perfect sensation. At othertimes I was quickly and impetuously smitten. I grew sick, and numb, andchilly, and dizzy, and so fell prostrate at once. Then, for weeks, allwas void, and black, and silent, and Nothing became the universe.Total annihilation could be no more. From these latter attacks I awoke,however, with a gradation slow in proportion to the suddenness of theseizure. Just as the day dawns to the friendless and houseless beggarwho roams the streets throughout the long desolate winter night--justso tardily--just so wearily--just so cheerily came back the light of theSoul to me.Apart from the tendency to trance, however, my general health appearedto be good; nor could I perceive that it was at all affected by the oneprevalent malady--unless, indeed, an idiosyncrasy in my ordinary sleepmay be looked upon as superinduced. Upon awaking from slumber, I couldnever gain, at once, thorough possession of my senses, and alwaysremained, for many minutes, in much bewilderment and perplexity;--themental faculties in general, but the memory in especial, being in acondition of absolute abeyance.In all that I endured there was no physical suffering but of moraldistress an infinitude. My fancy grew charnel, I talked &quot;of worms, oftombs, and epitaphs.&quot; I was lost in reveries of death, and the ideaof premature burial held continual possession of my brain. The ghastlyDanger to which I was subjected haunted me day and night. In the former,the torture of meditation was excessive--in the latter, supreme. Whenthe grim Darkness overspread the Earth, then, with every horror ofthought, I shook--shook as the quivering plumes upon the hearse. WhenNature could endure wakefulness no longer, it was with a struggle thatI consented to sleep--for I shuddered to reflect that, upon awaking, Imight find myself the tenant of a grave. And when, finally, I sank intoslumber, it was only to rush at once into a world of phantasms, abovewhich, with vast, sable, overshadowing wing, hovered, predominant, theone sepulchral Idea.From the innumerable images of gloom which thus oppressed me in dreams,I select for record but a solitary vision. Methought I was immersed ina cataleptic trance of more than usual duration and profundity. Suddenlythere came an icy hand upon my forehead, and an impatient, gibberingvoice whispered the word &quot;Arise!&quot; within my ear.I sat erect. The darkness was total. I could not see the figure of himwho had aroused me. I could call to mind neither the period at which Ihad fallen into the trance, nor the locality in which I then lay. WhileI remained motionless, and busied in endeavors to collect my thought,the cold hand grasped me fiercely by the wrist, shaking it petulantly,while the gibbering voice said again:&quot;Arise! did I not bid thee arise?&quot;&quot;And who,&quot; I demanded, &quot;art thou?&quot;&quot;I have no name in the regions which I inhabit,&quot; replied the voice,mournfully; &quot;I was mortal, but am fiend. I was merciless, but ampitiful. Thou dost feel that I shudder.--My teeth chatter as I speak,yet it is not with the chilliness of the night--of the night withoutend. But this hideousness is insufferable. How canst thou tranquillysleep? I cannot rest for the cry of these great agonies. These sightsare more than I can bear. Get thee up! Come with me into the outerNight, and let me unfold to thee the graves. Is not this a spectacle ofwoe?--Behold!&quot;I looked; and the unseen figure, which still grasped me by the wrist,had caused to be thrown open the graves of all mankind, and from eachissued the faint phosphoric radiance of decay, so that I could see intothe innermost recesses, and there view the shrouded bodies in theirsad and solemn slumbers with the worm. But alas! the real sleepers werefewer, by many millions, than those who slumbered not at all; and therewas a feeble struggling; and there was a general sad unrest; and fromout the depths of the countless pits there came a melancholy rustlingfrom the garments of the buried. And of those who seemed tranquillyto repose, I saw that a vast number had changed, in a greater or lessdegree, the rigid and uneasy position in which they had originally beenentombed. And the voice again said to me as I gazed:&quot;Is it not--oh! is it not a pitiful sight?&quot;--but, before I could findwords to reply, the figure had ceased to grasp my wrist, the phosphoriclights expired, and the graves were closed with a sudden violence, whilefrom out them arose a tumult of despairing cries, saying again: &quot;Is itnot--O, God, is it not a very pitiful sight?&quot;Phantasies such as these, presenting themselves at night, extended theirterrific influence far into my waking hours. My nerves became thoroughlyunstrung, and I fell a prey to perpetual horror. I hesitated to ride, orto walk, or to indulge in any exercise that would carry me from home.In fact, I no longer dared trust myself out of the immediate presenceof those who were aware of my proneness to catalepsy, lest, falling intoone of my usual fits, I should be buried before my real condition couldbe ascertained. I doubted the care, the fidelity of my dearest friends.I dreaded that, in some trance of more than customary duration, theymight be prevailed upon to regard me as irrecoverable. I even went sofar as to fear that, as I occasioned much trouble, they might be glad toconsider any very protracted attack as sufficient excuse for getting ridof me altogether. It was in vain they endeavored to reassure me by themost solemn promises. I exacted the most sacred oaths, that under nocircumstances they would bury me until decomposition had so materiallyadvanced as to render farther preservation impossible. And, eventhen, my mortal terrors would listen to no reason--would accept noconsolation. I entered into a series of elaborate precautions. Amongother things, I had the family vault so remodelled as to admit of beingreadily opened from within. The slightest pressure upon a long leverthat extended far into the tomb would cause the iron portal to fly back.There were arrangements also for the free admission of air and light,and convenient receptacles for food and water, within immediate reach ofthe coffin intended for my reception. This coffin was warmly and softlypadded, and was provided with a lid, fashioned upon the principle of thevault-door, with the addition of springs so contrived that the feeblestmovement of the body would be sufficient to set it at liberty. Besidesall this, there was suspended from the roof of the tomb, a large bell,the rope of which, it was designed, should extend through a hole in thecoffin, and so be fastened to one of the hands of the corpse. But, alas?what avails the vigilance against the Destiny of man? Not even thesewell-contrived securities sufficed to save from the uttermost agonies ofliving inhumation, a wretch to these agonies foredoomed!There arrived an epoch--as often before there had arrived--in which Ifound myself emerging from total unconsciousness into the firstfeeble and indefinite sense of existence. Slowly--with a tortoisegradation--approached the faint gray dawn of the psychal day. A torpiduneasiness. An apathetic endurance of dull pain. No care--no hope--noeffort. Then, after a long interval, a ringing in the ears; then,after a lapse still longer, a prickling or tingling sensation in theextremities; then a seemingly eternal period of pleasurable quiescence,during which the awakening feelings are struggling into thought; then abrief re-sinking into non-entity; then a sudden recovery. At length theslight quivering of an eyelid, and immediately thereupon, an electricshock of a terror, deadly and indefinite, which sends the blood intorrents from the temples to the heart. And now the first positiveeffort to think. And now the first endeavor to remember. And now apartial and evanescent success. And now the memory has so far regainedits dominion, that, in some measure, I am cognizant of my state. I feelthat I am not awaking from ordinary sleep. I recollect that I have beensubject to catalepsy. And now, at last, as if by the rush of an ocean,my shuddering spirit is overwhelmed by the one grim Danger--by the onespectral and ever-prevalent idea.For some minutes after this fancy possessed me, I remained withoutmotion. And why? I could not summon courage to move. I dared notmake the effort which was to satisfy me of my fate--and yet there wassomething at my heart which whispered me it was sure. Despair--such asno other species of wretchedness ever calls into being--despair aloneurged me, after long irresolution, to uplift the heavy lids of my eyes.I uplifted them. It was dark--all dark. I knew that the fit was over. Iknew that the crisis of my disorder had long passed. I knew that Ihad now fully recovered the use of my visual faculties--and yet it wasdark--all dark--the intense and utter raylessness of the Night thatendureth for evermore.I endeavored to shriek; and my lips and my parched tongue movedconvulsively together in the attempt--but no voice issued from thecavernous lungs, which oppressed as if by the weight of some incumbentmountain, gasped and palpitated, with the heart, at every elaborate andstruggling inspiration.The movement of the jaws, in this effort to cry aloud, showed me thatthey were bound up, as is usual with the dead. I felt, too, that I layupon some hard substance, and by something similar my sides were,also, closely compressed. So far, I had not ventured to stir any of mylimbs--but now I violently threw up my arms, which had been lying atlength, with the wrists crossed. They struck a solid wooden substance,which extended above my person at an elevation of not more than sixinches from my face. I could no longer doubt that I reposed within acoffin at last.And now, amid all my infinite miseries, came sweetly the cherubHope--for I thought of my precautions. I writhed, and made spasmodicexertions to force open the lid: it would not move. I felt my wrists forthe bell-rope: it was not to be found. And now the Comforter fled forever, and a still sterner Despair reigned triumphant; for I could nothelp perceiving the absence of the paddings which I had so carefullyprepared--and then, too, there came suddenly to my nostrils the strongpeculiar odor of moist earth. The conclusion was irresistible. I wasnot within the vault. I had fallen into a trance while absent fromhome--while among strangers--when, or how, I could not remember--andit was they who had buried me as a dog--nailed up in some commoncoffin--and thrust deep, deep, and for ever, into some ordinary andnameless grave.As this awful conviction forced itself, thus, into the innermostchambers of my soul, I once again struggled to cry aloud. And in thissecond endeavor I succeeded. A long, wild, and continuous shriek, oryell of agony, resounded through the realms of the subterranean Night.&quot;Hillo! hillo, there!&quot; said a gruff voice, in reply.&quot;What the devil's the matter now!&quot; said a second.&quot;Get out o' that!&quot; said a third.&quot;What do you mean by yowling in that ere kind of style, like acattymount?&quot; said a fourth; and hereupon I was seized and shakenwithout ceremony, for several minutes, by a junto of very rough-lookingindividuals. They did not arouse me from my slumber--for I was wideawake when I screamed--but they restored me to the full possession of mymemory.This adventure occurred near Richmond, in Virginia. Accompanied by afriend, I had proceeded, upon a gunning expedition, some miles down thebanks of the James River. Night approached, and we were overtaken bya storm. The cabin of a small sloop lying at anchor in the stream, andladen with garden mould, afforded us the only available shelter. We madethe best of it, and passed the night on board. I slept in one of theonly two berths in the vessel--and the berths of a sloop of sixty ortwenty tons need scarcely be described. That which I occupied had nobedding of any kind. Its extreme width was eighteen inches. The distanceof its bottom from the deck overhead was precisely the same. I found ita matter of exceeding difficulty to squeeze myself in. Nevertheless, Islept soundly, and the whole of my vision--for it was no dream, and nonightmare--arose naturally from the circumstances of my position--frommy ordinary bias of thought--and from the difficulty, to which I havealluded, of collecting my senses, and especially of regaining my memory,for a long time after awaking from slumber. The men who shook me werethe crew of the sloop, and some laborers engaged to unload it. From theload itself came the earthly smell. The bandage about the jaws was asilk handkerchief in which I had bound up my head, in default of mycustomary nightcap.The tortures endured, however, were indubitably quite equal for thetime, to those of actual sepulture. They were fearfully--they wereinconceivably hideous; but out of Evil proceeded Good; for their veryexcess wrought in my spirit an inevitable revulsion. My soul acquiredtone--acquired temper. I went abroad. I took vigorous exercise. Ibreathed the free air of Heaven. I thought upon other subjects thanDeath. I discarded my medical books. &quot;Buchan&quot; I burned. I read no &quot;NightThoughts&quot;--no fustian about churchyards--no bugaboo tales--such asthis. In short, I became a new man, and lived a man's life. From thatmemorable night, I dismissed forever my charnel apprehensions, and withthem vanished the cataleptic disorder, of which, perhaps, they had beenless the consequence than the cause.There are moments when, even to the sober eye of Reason, the world ofour sad Humanity may assume the semblance of a Hell--but the imaginationof man is no Carathis, to explore with impunity its every cavern. Alas!the grim legion of sepulchral terrors cannot be regarded as altogetherfanciful--but, like the Demons in whose company Afrasiab made his voyagedown the Oxus, they must sleep, or they will devour us--they must besuffered to slumber, or we perish.THE DOMAIN OF ARNHEIM     The garden like a lady fair was cut,     That lay as if she slumbered in delight,     And to the open skies her eyes did shut.     The azure fields of Heaven were 'sembled right     In a large round, set with the flowers of light.     The flowers de luce, and the round sparks of dew.     That hung upon their azure leaves did shew     Like twinkling stars that sparkle in the evening blue.     Giles Fletcher.FROM his cradle to his grave a gale of prosperity bore my friend Ellisonalong. Nor do I use the word prosperity in its mere worldly sense. Imean it as synonymous with happiness. The person of whom I speak seemedborn for the purpose of foreshadowing the doctrines of Turgot, Price,Priestley, and Condorcet--of exemplifying by individual instancewhat has been deemed the chimera of the perfectionists. In the briefexistence of Ellison I fancy that I have seen refuted the dogma, that inman's very nature lies some hidden principle, the antagonist of bliss.An anxious examination of his career has given me to understand that ingeneral, from the violation of a few simple laws of humanity arises thewretchedness of mankind--that as a species we have in our possession theas yet unwrought elements of content--and that, even now, in the presentdarkness and madness of all thought on the great question of the socialcondition, it is not impossible that man, the individual, under certainunusual and highly fortuitous conditions, may be happy.With opinions such as these my young friend, too, was fully imbued, andthus it is worthy of observation that the uninterrupted enjoyment whichdistinguished his life was, in great measure, the result of preconcert.It is indeed evident that with less of the instinctive philosophy which,now and then, stands so well in the stead of experience, Mr. Ellisonwould have found himself precipitated, by the very extraordinary successof his life, into the common vortex of unhappiness which yawns for thoseof pre-eminent endowments. But it is by no means my object to pen anessay on happiness. The ideas of my friend may be summed up in a fewwords. He admitted but four elementary principles, or more strictly,conditions of bliss. That which he considered chief was (strange tosay!) the simple and purely physical one of free exercise in the openair. &quot;The health,&quot; he said, &quot;attainable by other means is scarcely worththe name.&quot; He instanced the ecstasies of the fox-hunter, and pointed tothe tillers of the earth, the only people who, as a class, can be fairlyconsidered happier than others. His second condition was the love ofwoman. His third, and most difficult of realization, was the contemptof ambition. His fourth was an object of unceasing pursuit; and he heldthat, other things being equal, the extent of attainable happiness wasin proportion to the spirituality of this object.Ellison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of good giftslavished upon him by fortune. In personal grace and beauty he exceededall men. His intellect was of that order to which the acquisition ofknowledge is less a labor than an intuition and a necessity. Hisfamily was one of the most illustrious of the empire. His bride was theloveliest and most devoted of women. His possessions had been alwaysample; but on the attainment of his majority, it was discovered thatone of those extraordinary freaks of fate had been played in his behalfwhich startle the whole social world amid which they occur, and seldomfail radically to alter the moral constitution of those who are theirobjects.It appears that about a hundred years before Mr. Ellison's coming ofage, there had died, in a remote province, one Mr. Seabright Ellison.This gentleman had amassed a princely fortune, and, having no immediateconnections, conceived the whim of suffering his wealth to accumulatefor a century after his decease. Minutely and sagaciously directing thevarious modes of investment, he bequeathed the aggregate amount to thenearest of blood, bearing the name of Ellison, who should be alive atthe end of the hundred years. Many attempts had been made to set asidethis singular bequest; their ex post facto character rendered themabortive; but the attention of a jealous government was aroused, and alegislative act finally obtained, forbidding all similar accumulations.This act, however, did not prevent young Ellison from entering intopossession, on his twenty-first birthday, as the heir of his ancestorSeabright, of a fortune of four hundred and fifty millions of dollars.(*1)When it had become known that such was the enormous wealth inherited,there were, of course, many speculations as to the mode of its disposal.The magnitude and the immediate availability of the sum bewildered allwho thought on the topic. The possessor of any appreciable amount ofmoney might have been imagined to perform any one of a thousand things.With riches merely surpassing those of any citizen, it would havebeen easy to suppose him engaging to supreme excess in the fashionableextravagances of his time--or busying himself with politicalintrigue--or aiming at ministerial power--or purchasing increaseof nobility--or collecting large museums of virtu--or playing themunificent patron of letters, of science, of art--or endowing, andbestowing his name upon extensive institutions of charity. But for theinconceivable wealth in the actual possession of the heir, these objectsand all ordinary objects were felt to afford too limited a field.Recourse was had to figures, and these but sufficed to confound. It wasseen that, even at three per cent., the annual income of the inheritanceamounted to no less than thirteen millions and five hundred thousanddollars; which was one million and one hundred and twenty-five thousandper month; or thirty-six thousand nine hundred and eighty-six per day;or one thousand five hundred and forty-one per hour; or six and twentydollars for every minute that flew. Thus the usual track of suppositionwas thoroughly broken up. Men knew not what to imagine. There were somewho even conceived that Mr. Ellison would divest himself of at leastone-half of his fortune, as of utterly superfluous opulence--enrichingwhole troops of his relatives by division of his superabundance. To thenearest of these he did, in fact, abandon the very unusual wealth whichwas his own before the inheritance.I was not surprised, however, to perceive that he had long made up hismind on a point which had occasioned so much discussion to his friends.Nor was I greatly astonished at the nature of his decision. In regard toindividual charities he had satisfied his conscience. In the possibilityof any improvement, properly so called, being effected by man himself inthe general condition of man, he had (I am sorry to confess it) littlefaith. Upon the whole, whether happily or unhappily, he was thrown back,in very great measure, upon self.In the widest and noblest sense he was a poet. He comprehended,moreover, the true character, the august aims, the supreme majesty anddignity of the poetic sentiment. The fullest, if not the sole propersatisfaction of this sentiment he instinctively felt to lie in thecreation of novel forms of beauty. Some peculiarities, either in hisearly education, or in the nature of his intellect, had tinged withwhat is termed materialism all his ethical speculations; and it was thisbias, perhaps, which led him to believe that the most advantageous atleast, if not the sole legitimate field for the poetic exercise, liesin the creation of novel moods of purely physical loveliness. Thus ithappened he became neither musician nor poet--if we use this latter termin its every-day acceptation. Or it might have been that he neglectedto become either, merely in pursuance of his idea that in contempt ofambition is to be found one of the essential principles of happiness onearth. Is it not indeed, possible that, while a high order of geniusis necessarily ambitious, the highest is above that which is termedambition? And may it not thus happen that many far greater than Miltonhave contentedly remained &quot;mute and inglorious?&quot; I believe that theworld has never seen--and that, unless through some series of accidentsgoading the noblest order of mind into distasteful exertion, the worldwill never see--that full extent of triumphant execution, in the richerdomains of art, of which the human nature is absolutely capable.Ellison became neither musician nor poet; although no man lived moreprofoundly enamored of music and poetry. Under other circumstances thanthose which invested him, it is not impossible that he would have becomea painter. Sculpture, although in its nature rigorously poetical was toolimited in its extent and consequences, to have occupied, at any time,much of his attention. And I have now mentioned all the provinces inwhich the common understanding of the poetic sentiment has declared itcapable of expatiating. But Ellison maintained that the richest, thetruest, and most natural, if not altogether the most extensive province,had been unaccountably neglected. No definition had spoken of thelandscape-gardener as of the poet; yet it seemed to my friend that thecreation of the landscape-garden offered to the proper Muse the mostmagnificent of opportunities. Here, indeed, was the fairest field forthe display of imagination in the endless combining of forms ofnovel beauty; the elements to enter into combination being, by a vastsuperiority, the most glorious which the earth could afford. In themultiform and multicolor of the flowers and the trees, he recognised themost direct and energetic efforts of Nature at physical loveliness. Andin the direction or concentration of this effort--or, more properly,in its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it on earth--heperceived that he should be employing the best means--laboring to thegreatest advantage--in the fulfilment, not only of his own destiny aspoet, but of the august purposes for which the Deity had implanted thepoetic sentiment in man.&quot;Its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it on earth.&quot; In hisexplanation of this phraseology, Mr. Ellison did much toward solvingwhat has always seemed to me an enigma:--I mean the fact (which nonebut the ignorant dispute) that no such combination of scenery exists innature as the painter of genius may produce. No such paradises are tobe found in reality as have glowed on the canvas of Claude. In the mostenchanting of natural landscapes, there will always be found a defector an excess--many excesses and defects. While the component parts maydefy, individually, the highest skill of the artist, the arrangementof these parts will always be susceptible of improvement. In short, noposition can be attained on the wide surface of the natural earth,from which an artistical eye, looking steadily, will not find matter ofoffence in what is termed the &quot;composition&quot; of the landscape. Andyet how unintelligible is this! In all other matters we are justlyinstructed to regard nature as supreme. With her details we shrink fromcompetition. Who shall presume to imitate the colors of the tulip, or toimprove the proportions of the lily of the valley? The criticism whichsays, of sculpture or portraiture, that here nature is to be exalted oridealized rather than imitated, is in error. No pictorial or sculpturalcombinations of points of human liveliness do more than approach theliving and breathing beauty. In landscape alone is the principle of thecritic true; and, having felt its truth here, it is but the headlongspirit of generalization which has led him to pronounce it truethroughout all the domains of art. Having, I say, felt its truth here;for the feeling is no affectation or chimera. The mathematics afford nomore absolute demonstrations than the sentiments of his art yields theartist. He not only believes, but positively knows, that such andsuch apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter constitute and aloneconstitute the true beauty. His reasons, however, have not yet beenmatured into expression. It remains for a more profound analysisthan the world has yet seen, fully to investigate and express them.Nevertheless he is confirmed in his instinctive opinions by the voice ofall his brethren. Let a &quot;composition&quot; be defective; let an emendationbe wrought in its mere arrangement of form; let this emendation besubmitted to every artist in the world; by each will its necessitybe admitted. And even far more than this:--in remedy of the defectivecomposition, each insulated member of the fraternity would havesuggested the identical emendation.I repeat that in landscape arrangements alone is the physical naturesusceptible of exaltation, and that, therefore, her susceptibility ofimprovement at this one point, was a mystery I had been unable to solve.My own thoughts on the subject had rested in the idea that the primitiveintention of nature would have so arranged the earth's surface as tohave fulfilled at all points man's sense of perfection in the beautiful,the sublime, or the picturesque; but that this primitive intention hadbeen frustrated by the known geological disturbances--disturbances ofform and color--grouping, in the correction or allaying of which liesthe soul of art. The force of this idea was much weakened, however, bythe necessity which it involved of considering the disturbances abnormaland unadapted to any purpose. It was Ellison who suggested thatthey were prognostic of death. He thus explained:--Admit the earthlyimmortality of man to have been the first intention. We have then theprimitive arrangement of the earth's surface adapted to his blissfulestate, as not existent but designed. The disturbances were thepreparations for his subsequently conceived deathful condition.&quot;Now,&quot; said my friend, &quot;what we regard as exaltation of the landscapemay be really such, as respects only the moral or human point of view.Each alteration of the natural scenery may possibly effect a blemishin the picture, if we can suppose this picture viewed at large--inmass--from some point distant from the earth's surface, although notbeyond the limits of its atmosphere. It is easily understood that whatmight improve a closely scrutinized detail, may at the same time injurea general or more distantly observed effect. There may be a class ofbeings, human once, but now invisible to humanity, to whom, from afar,our disorder may seem order--our unpicturesqueness picturesque, in aword, the earth-angels, for whose scrutiny more especially than our own,and for whose death-refined appreciation of the beautiful, may havebeen set in array by God the wide landscape-gardens of the hemispheres.&quot;In the course of discussion, my friend quoted some passages from awriter on landscape-gardening who has been supposed to have well treatedhis theme:&quot;There are properly but two styles of landscape-gardening, the naturaland the artificial. One seeks to recall the original beauty of thecountry, by adapting its means to the surrounding scenery, cultivatingtrees in harmony with the hills or plain of the neighboring land;detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size,proportion, and color which, hid from the common observer, are revealedeverywhere to the experienced student of nature. The result of thenatural style of gardening, is seen rather in the absence of alldefects and incongruities--in the prevalence of a healthy harmony andorder--than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles. Theartificial style has as many varieties as there are different tastesto gratify. It has a certain general relation to the various styles ofbuilding. There are the stately avenues and retirements of Versailles;Italian terraces; and a various mixed old English style, whichbears some relation to the domestic Gothic or English Elizabethanarchitecture. Whatever may be said against the abuses of the artificiallandscape-gardening, a mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to ita great beauty. This is partly pleasing to the eye, by the show oforder and design, and partly moral. A terrace, with an old moss-coveredbalustrade, calls up at once to the eye the fair forms that have passedthere in other days. The slightest exhibition of art is an evidence ofcare and human interest.&quot;&quot;From what I have already observed,&quot; said Ellison, &quot;you will understandthat I reject the idea, here expressed, of recalling the original beautyof the country. The original beauty is never so great as that which maybe introduced. Of course, every thing depends on the selection of aspot with capabilities. What is said about detecting and bringing intopractice nice relations of size, proportion, and color, is one of thosemere vaguenesses of speech which serve to veil inaccuracy of thought.The phrase quoted may mean any thing, or nothing, and guides in nodegree. That the true result of the natural style of gardening is seenrather in the absence of all defects and incongruities than in thecreation of any special wonders or miracles, is a proposition bettersuited to the grovelling apprehension of the herd than to the ferviddreams of the man of genius. The negative merit suggested appertains tothat hobbling criticism which, in letters, would elevate Addison intoapotheosis. In truth, while that virtue which consists in the mereavoidance of vice appeals directly to the understanding, and can thus becircumscribed in rule, the loftier virtue, which flames in creation, canbe apprehended in its results alone. Rule applies but to the merits ofdenial--to the excellencies which refrain. Beyond these, the criticalart can but suggest. We may be instructed to build a &quot;Cato,&quot; but weare in vain told how to conceive a Parthenon or an &quot;Inferno.&quot; Thething done, however; the wonder accomplished; and the capacity forapprehension becomes universal. The sophists of the negative school who,through inability to create, have scoffed at creation, are now foundthe loudest in applause. What, in its chrysalis condition of principle,affronted their demure reason, never fails, in its maturity ofaccomplishment, to extort admiration from their instinct of beauty.&quot;The author's observations on the artificial style,&quot; continued Ellison,&quot;are less objectionable. A mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds toit a great beauty. This is just; as also is the reference to the senseof human interest. The principle expressed is incontrovertible--butthere may be something beyond it. There may be an object in keeping withthe principle--an object unattainable by the means ordinarily possessedby individuals, yet which, if attained, would lend a charm to thelandscape-garden far surpassing that which a sense of merely humaninterest could bestow. A poet, having very unusual pecuniary resources,might, while retaining the necessary idea of art or culture, or, asour author expresses it, of interest, so imbue his designs at once withextent and novelty of beauty, as to convey the sentiment of spiritualinterference. It will be seen that, in bringing about such result, hesecures all the advantages of interest or design, while relieving hiswork of the harshness or technicality of the worldly art. In themost rugged of wildernesses--in the most savage of the scenes of purenature--there is apparent the art of a creator; yet this art is apparentto reflection only; in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling.Now let us suppose this sense of the Almighty design to be one stepdepressed--to be brought into something like harmony or consistency withthe sense of human art--to form an intermedium between the two:--letus imagine, for example, a landscape whose combined vastness anddefinitiveness--whose united beauty, magnificence, and strangeness,shall convey the idea of care, or culture, or superintendence, on thepart of beings superior, yet akin to humanity--then the sentiment ofinterest is preserved, while the art intervolved is made to assume theair of an intermediate or secondary nature--a nature which is not God,nor an emanation from God, but which still is nature in the sense of thehandiwork of the angels that hover between man and God.&quot;It was in devoting his enormous wealth to the embodiment of a visionsuch as this--in the free exercise in the open air ensured by thepersonal superintendence of his plans--in the unceasing object whichthese plans afforded--in the high spirituality of the object--inthe contempt of ambition which it enabled him truly to feel--in theperennial springs with which it gratified, without possibility ofsatiating, that one master passion of his soul, the thirst for beauty,above all, it was in the sympathy of a woman, not unwomanly, whoseloveliness and love enveloped his existence in the purple atmosphere ofParadise, that Ellison thought to find, and found, exemption fromthe ordinary cares of humanity, with a far greater amount of positivehappiness than ever glowed in the rapt day-dreams of De Stael.I despair of conveying to the reader any distinct conception of themarvels which my friend did actually accomplish. I wish to describe, butam disheartened by the difficulty of description, and hesitate betweendetail and generality. Perhaps the better course will be to unite thetwo in their extremes.Mr. Ellison's first step regarded, of course, the choice of a locality,and scarcely had he commenced thinking on this point, when the luxuriantnature of the Pacific Islands arrested his attention. In fact, hehad made up his mind for a voyage to the South Seas, when a night'sreflection induced him to abandon the idea. &quot;Were I misanthropic,&quot; hesaid, &quot;such a locale would suit me. The thoroughness of its insulationand seclusion, and the difficulty of ingress and egress, would in suchcase be the charm of charms; but as yet I am not Timon. I wish thecomposure but not the depression of solitude. There must remain with mea certain control over the extent and duration of my repose. There willbe frequent hours in which I shall need, too, the sympathy of the poeticin what I have done. Let me seek, then, a spot not far from a populouscity--whose vicinity, also, will best enable me to execute my plans.&quot;In search of a suitable place so situated, Ellison travelled for severalyears, and I was permitted to accompany him. A thousand spots withwhich I was enraptured he rejected without hesitation, for reasons whichsatisfied me, in the end, that he was right. We came at length to anelevated table-land of wonderful fertility and beauty, affording apanoramic prospect very little less in extent than that of Aetna, and,in Ellison's opinion as well as my own, surpassing the far-famed viewfrom that mountain in all the true elements of the picturesque.&quot;I am aware,&quot; said the traveller, as he drew a sigh of deep delightafter gazing on this scene, entranced, for nearly an hour, &quot;I know thathere, in my circumstances, nine-tenths of the most fastidious of menwould rest content. This panorama is indeed glorious, and I shouldrejoice in it but for the excess of its glory. The taste of all thearchitects I have ever known leads them, for the sake of 'prospect,' toput up buildings on hill-tops. The error is obvious. Grandeur in any ofits moods, but especially in that of extent, startles, excites--and thenfatigues, depresses. For the occasional scene nothing can be better--forthe constant view nothing worse. And, in the constant view, the mostobjectionable phase of grandeur is that of extent; the worst phase ofextent, that of distance. It is at war with the sentiment and with thesense of seclusion--the sentiment and sense which we seek to humor in'retiring to the country.' In looking from the summit of a mountain wecannot help feeling abroad in the world. The heart-sick avoid distantprospects as a pestilence.&quot;It was not until toward the close of the fourth year of our search thatwe found a locality with which Ellison professed himself satisfied. Itis, of course, needless to say where was the locality. The late death ofmy friend, in causing his domain to be thrown open to certain classesof visiters, has given to Arnheim a species of secret and subdued ifnot solemn celebrity, similar in kind, although infinitely superior indegree, to that which so long distinguished Fonthill.The usual approach to Arnheim was by the river. The visiter left thecity in the early morning. During the forenoon he passed between shoresof a tranquil and domestic beauty, on which grazed innumerable sheep,their white fleeces spotting the vivid green of rolling meadows. Bydegrees the idea of cultivation subsided into that of merely pastoralcare. This slowly became merged in a sense of retirement--this again ina consciousness of solitude. As the evening approached, the channel grewmore narrow, the banks more and more precipitous; and these latterwere clothed in rich, more profuse, and more sombre foliage. The waterincreased in transparency. The stream took a thousand turns, so that atno moment could its gleaming surface be seen for a greater distancethan a furlong. At every instant the vessel seemed imprisoned within anenchanted circle, having insuperable and impenetrable walls of foliage,a roof of ultramarine satin, and no floor--the keel balancing itselfwith admirable nicety on that of a phantom bark which, by some accidenthaving been turned upside down, floated in constant company with thesubstantial one, for the purpose of sustaining it. The channel nowbecame a gorge--although the term is somewhat inapplicable, and I employit merely because the language has no word which better representsthe most striking--not the most distinctive--feature of the scene. Thecharacter of gorge was maintained only in the height and parallelism ofthe shores; it was lost altogether in their other traits. The walls ofthe ravine (through which the clear water still tranquilly flowed) aroseto an elevation of a hundred and occasionally of a hundred and fiftyfeet, and inclined so much toward each other as, in a great measure, toshut out the light of day; while the long plume-like moss which dependeddensely from the intertwining shrubberies overhead, gave the wholechasm an air of funereal gloom. The windings became more frequent andintricate, and seemed often as if returning in upon themselves, sothat the voyager had long lost all idea of direction. He was, moreover,enwrapt in an exquisite sense of the strange. The thought of naturestill remained, but her character seemed to have undergone modification,there was a weird symmetry, a thrilling uniformity, a wizard proprietyin these her works. Not a dead branch--not a withered leaf--not a straypebble--not a patch of the brown earth was anywhere visible. The crystalwater welled up against the clean granite, or the unblemished moss, witha sharpness of outline that delighted while it bewildered the eye.Having threaded the mazes of this channel for some hours, the gloomdeepening every moment, a sharp and unexpected turn of the vesselbrought it suddenly, as if dropped from heaven, into a circular basin ofvery considerable extent when compared with the width of the gorge. Itwas about two hundred yards in diameter, and girt in at all points butone--that immediately fronting the vessel as it entered--by hills equalin general height to the walls of the chasm, although of a thoroughlydifferent character. Their sides sloped from the water's edge at anangle of some forty-five degrees, and they were clothed from base tosummit--not a perceptible point escaping--in a drapery of the mostgorgeous flower-blossoms; scarcely a green leaf being visible among thesea of odorous and fluctuating color. This basin was of great depth, butso transparent was the water that the bottom, which seemed to consist ofa thick mass of small round alabaster pebbles, was distinctly visibleby glimpses--that is to say, whenever the eye could permit itself notto see, far down in the inverted heaven, the duplicate blooming of thehills. On these latter there were no trees, nor even shrubs of any size.The impressions wrought on the observer were those of richness,warmth, color, quietude, uniformity, softness, delicacy, daintiness,voluptuousness, and a miraculous extremeness of culture that suggesteddreams of a new race of fairies, laborious, tasteful, magnificent, andfastidious; but as the eye traced upward the myriad-tinted slope, fromits sharp junction with the water to its vague termination amid thefolds of overhanging cloud, it became, indeed, difficult not to fancya panoramic cataract of rubies, sapphires, opals, and golden onyxes,rolling silently out of the sky.The visiter, shooting suddenly into this bay from out the gloom of theravine, is delighted but astounded by the full orb of the declining sun,which he had supposed to be already far below the horizon, but which nowconfronts him, and forms the sole termination of an otherwise limitlessvista seen through another chasm-like rift in the hills.But here the voyager quits the vessel which has borne him so far, anddescends into a light canoe of ivory, stained with arabesque devices invivid scarlet, both within and without. The poop and beak of this boatarise high above the water, with sharp points, so that the general formis that of an irregular crescent. It lies on the surface of the baywith the proud grace of a swan. On its ermined floor reposes a singlefeathery paddle of satin-wood; but no oarsmen or attendant is to beseen. The guest is bidden to be of good cheer--that the fates will takecare of him. The larger vessel disappears, and he is left alone in thecanoe, which lies apparently motionless in the middle of the lake.While he considers what course to pursue, however, he becomes aware of agentle movement in the fairy bark. It slowly swings itself around untilits prow points toward the sun. It advances with a gentle but graduallyaccelerated velocity, while the slight ripples it creates seem to breakabout the ivory side in divinest melody-seem to offer the only possibleexplanation of the soothing yet melancholy music for whose unseen originthe bewildered voyager looks around him in vain.The canoe steadily proceeds, and the rocky gate of the vista isapproached, so that its depths can be more distinctly seen. To theright arise a chain of lofty hills rudely and luxuriantly wooded. It isobserved, however, that the trait of exquisite cleanness where the bankdips into the water, still prevails. There is not one token of the usualriver debris. To the left the character of the scene is softer and moreobviously artificial. Here the bank slopes upward from the stream ina very gentle ascent, forming a broad sward of grass of a textureresembling nothing so much as velvet, and of a brilliancy of green whichwould bear comparison with the tint of the purest emerald. This plateauvaries in width from ten to three hundred yards; reaching from theriver-bank to a wall, fifty feet high, which extends, in an infinity ofcurves, but following the general direction of the river, until lost inthe distance to the westward. This wall is of one continuous rock, andhas been formed by cutting perpendicularly the once rugged precipice ofthe stream's southern bank, but no trace of the labor has been sufferedto remain. The chiselled stone has the hue of ages, and is profuselyoverhung and overspread with the ivy, the coral honeysuckle, theeglantine, and the clematis. The uniformity of the top and bottom linesof the wall is fully relieved by occasional trees of gigantic height,growing singly or in small groups, both along the plateau and in thedomain behind the wall, but in close proximity to it; so that frequentlimbs (of the black walnut especially) reach over and dip their pendentextremities into the water. Farther back within the domain, the visionis impeded by an impenetrable screen of foliage.These things are observed during the canoe's gradual approach to what Ihave called the gate of the vista. On drawing nearer to this, however,its chasm-like appearance vanishes; a new outlet from the bay isdiscovered to the left--in which direction the wall is also seen tosweep, still following the general course of the stream. Down this newopening the eye cannot penetrate very far; for the stream, accompaniedby the wall, still bends to the left, until both are swallowed up by theleaves.The boat, nevertheless, glides magically into the winding channel; andhere the shore opposite the wall is found to resemble that oppositethe wall in the straight vista. Lofty hills, rising occasionally intomountains, and covered with vegetation in wild luxuriance, still shut inthe scene.Floating gently onward, but with a velocity slightly augmented, thevoyager, after many short turns, finds his progress apparently barred bya gigantic gate or rather door of burnished gold, elaborately carved andfretted, and reflecting the direct rays of the now fast-sinking sunwith an effulgence that seems to wreath the whole surrounding forest inflames. This gate is inserted in the lofty wall; which here appears tocross the river at right angles. In a few moments, however, it is seenthat the main body of the water still sweeps in a gentle and extensivecurve to the left, the wall following it as before, while a stream ofconsiderable volume, diverging from the principal one, makes its way,with a slight ripple, under the door, and is thus hidden from sight.The canoe falls into the lesser channel and approaches the gate. Itsponderous wings are slowly and musically expanded. The boat glidesbetween them, and commences a rapid descent into a vast amphitheatreentirely begirt with purple mountains, whose bases are laved by agleaming river throughout the full extent of their circuit. Meantimethe whole Paradise of Arnheim bursts upon the view. There is a gushof entrancing melody; there is an oppressive sense of strange sweetodor,--there is a dream-like intermingling to the eye of tallslender Eastern trees--bosky shrubberies--flocks of golden and crimsonbirds--lily-fringed lakes--meadows of violets, tulips, poppies,hyacinths, and tuberoses--long intertangled lines of silverstreamlets--and, upspringing confusedly from amid all, a mass ofsemi-Gothic, semi-Saracenic architecture sustaining itself by miracle inmid-air, glittering in the red sunlight with a hundred oriels, minarets,and pinnacles; and seeming the phantom handiwork, conjointly, of theSylphs, of the Fairies, of the Genii and of the Gnomes.LANDOR'S COTTAGE     A Pendant to &quot;The Domain of Arnheim&quot;DURING A pedestrian trip last summer, through one or two of the rivercounties of New York, I found myself, as the day declined, somewhatembarrassed about the road I was pursuing. The land undulated veryremarkably; and my path, for the last hour, had wound about and about soconfusedly, in its effort to keep in the valleys, that I no longer knewin what direction lay the sweet village of B----, where I had determinedto stop for the night. The sun had scarcely shone--strictlyspeaking--during the day, which nevertheless, had been unpleasantlywarm. A smoky mist, resembling that of the Indian summer, enveloped allthings, and of course, added to my uncertainty. Not that I cared muchabout the matter. If I did not hit upon the village before sunset,or even before dark, it was more than possible that a littleDutch farmhouse, or something of that kind, would soon make itsappearance--although, in fact, the neighborhood (perhaps on account ofbeing more picturesque than fertile) was very sparsely inhabited. Atall events, with my knapsack for a pillow, and my hound as a sentry, abivouac in the open air was just the thing which would have amused me.I sauntered on, therefore, quite at ease--Ponto taking charge of mygun--until at length, just as I had begun to consider whether thenumerous little glades that led hither and thither, were intended tobe paths at all, I was conducted by one of them into an unquestionablecarriage track. There could be no mistaking it. The traces of lightwheels were evident; and although the tall shrubberies and overgrownundergrowth met overhead, there was no obstruction whatever below, evento the passage of a Virginian mountain wagon--the most aspiring vehicle,I take it, of its kind. The road, however, except in being open throughthe wood--if wood be not too weighty a name for such an assemblage oflight trees--and except in the particulars of evident wheel-tracks--boreno resemblance to any road I had before seen. The tracks of which Ispeak were but faintly perceptible--having been impressed upon the firm,yet pleasantly moist surface of--what looked more like green Genoesevelvet than any thing else. It was grass, clearly--but grass such as weseldom see out of England--so short, so thick, so even, and so vivid incolor. Not a single impediment lay in the wheel-route--not even a chipor dead twig. The stones that once obstructed the way had been carefullyplaced--not thrown-along the sides of the lane, so as to define itsboundaries at bottom with a kind of half-precise, half-negligent, andwholly picturesque definition. Clumps of wild flowers grew everywhere,luxuriantly, in the interspaces.What to make of all this, of course I knew not. Here was artundoubtedly--that did not surprise me--all roads, in the ordinary sense,are works of art; nor can I say that there was much to wonder at in themere excess of art manifested; all that seemed to have been done, mighthave been done here--with such natural &quot;capabilities&quot; (as they haveit in the books on Landscape Gardening)--with very little labor andexpense. No; it was not the amount but the character of the art whichcaused me to take a seat on one of the blossomy stones and gaze up anddown this fairy-like avenue for half an hour or more in bewilderedadmiration. One thing became more and more evident the longer Igazed: an artist, and one with a most scrupulous eye for form, hadsuperintended all these arrangements. The greatest care had been takento preserve a due medium between the neat and graceful on the one hand,and the pittoresque, in the true sense of the Italian term, on theother. There were few straight, and no long uninterrupted lines. Thesame effect of curvature or of color appeared twice, usually, but notoftener, at any one point of view. Everywhere was variety in uniformity.It was a piece of &quot;composition,&quot; in which the most fastidiously criticaltaste could scarcely have suggested an emendation.I had turned to the right as I entered this road, and now, arising, Icontinued in the same direction. The path was so serpentine, that atno moment could I trace its course for more than two or three paces inadvance. Its character did not undergo any material change.Presently the murmur of water fell gently upon my ear--and in a fewmoments afterward, as I turned with the road somewhat more abruptly thanhitherto, I became aware that a building of some kind lay at the footof a gentle declivity just before me. I could see nothing distinctly onaccount of the mist which occupied all the little valley below. A gentlebreeze, however, now arose, as the sun was about descending; and whileI remained standing on the brow of the slope, the fog gradually becamedissipated into wreaths, and so floated over the scene.As it came fully into view--thus gradually as I describe it--piece bypiece, here a tree, there a glimpse of water, and here again the summitof a chimney, I could scarcely help fancying that the whole was one ofthe ingenious illusions sometimes exhibited under the name of &quot;vanishingpictures.&quot;By the time, however, that the fog had thoroughly disappeared, the sunhad made its way down behind the gentle hills, and thence, as if witha slight chassez to the south, had come again fully into sight, glaringwith a purplish lustre through a chasm that entered the valley from thewest. Suddenly, therefore--and as if by the hand of magic--this wholevalley and every thing in it became brilliantly visible.The first coup d'oeil, as the sun slid into the position described,impressed me very much as I have been impressed, when a boy, bythe concluding scene of some well-arranged theatrical spectacle ormelodrama. Not even the monstrosity of color was wanting; for thesunlight came out through the chasm, tinted all orange and purple; whilethe vivid green of the grass in the valley was reflected more or lessupon all objects from the curtain of vapor that still hung overhead,as if loth to take its total departure from a scene so enchantinglybeautiful.The little vale into which I thus peered down from under the fog canopycould not have been more than four hundred yards long; while in breadthit varied from fifty to one hundred and fifty or perhaps two hundred.It was most narrow at its northern extremity, opening out as it tendedsouthwardly, but with no very precise regularity. The widest portionwas within eighty yards of the southern extreme. The slopes whichencompassed the vale could not fairly be called hills, unless at theirnorthern face. Here a precipitous ledge of granite arose to a height ofsome ninety feet; and, as I have mentioned, the valley at this point wasnot more than fifty feet wide; but as the visiter proceeded southwardlyfrom the cliff, he found on his right hand and on his left, declivitiesat once less high, less precipitous, and less rocky. All, in a word,sloped and softened to the south; and yet the whole vale was engirdledby eminences, more or less high, except at two points. One of these Ihave already spoken of. It lay considerably to the north of west, andwas where the setting sun made its way, as I have before described, intothe amphitheatre, through a cleanly cut natural cleft in the graniteembankment; this fissure might have been ten yards wide at its widestpoint, so far as the eye could trace it. It seemed to lead up, up like anatural causeway, into the recesses of unexplored mountains and forests.The other opening was directly at the southern end of the vale. Here,generally, the slopes were nothing more than gentle inclinations,extending from east to west about one hundred and fifty yards. In themiddle of this extent was a depression, level with the ordinary floor ofthe valley. As regards vegetation, as well as in respect to every thingelse, the scene softened and sloped to the south. To the north--on thecraggy precipice--a few paces from the verge--up sprang the magnificenttrunks of numerous hickories, black walnuts, and chestnuts, interspersedwith occasional oak, and the strong lateral branches thrown out by thewalnuts especially, spread far over the edge of the cliff. Proceedingsouthwardly, the explorer saw, at first, the same class of trees,but less and less lofty and Salvatorish in character; then he saw thegentler elm, succeeded by the sassafras and locust--these again by thesofter linden, red-bud, catalpa, and maple--these yet again by stillmore graceful and more modest varieties. The whole face of the southerndeclivity was covered with wild shrubbery alone--an occasionalsilver willow or white poplar excepted. In the bottom of the valleyitself--(for it must be borne in mind that the vegetation hithertomentioned grew only on the cliffs or hillsides)--were to be seen threeinsulated trees. One was an elm of fine size and exquisite form: itstood guard over the southern gate of the vale. Another was a hickory,much larger than the elm, and altogether a much finer tree, althoughboth were exceedingly beautiful: it seemed to have taken charge of thenorthwestern entrance, springing from a group of rocks in the very jawsof the ravine, and throwing its graceful body, at an angle of nearlyforty-five degrees, far out into the sunshine of the amphitheatre. Aboutthirty yards east of this tree stood, however, the pride of the valley,and beyond all question the most magnificent tree I have ever seen,unless, perhaps, among the cypresses of the Itchiatuckanee. It was atriple-stemmed tulip-tree--the Liriodendron Tulipiferum--one of thenatural order of magnolias. Its three trunks separated from the parentat about three feet from the soil, and diverging very slightly andgradually, were not more than four feet apart at the point where thelargest stem shot out into foliage: this was at an elevation of abouteighty feet. The whole height of the principal division was one hundredand twenty feet. Nothing can surpass in beauty the form, or the glossy,vivid green of the leaves of the tulip-tree. In the present instancethey were fully eight inches wide; but their glory was altogethereclipsed by the gorgeous splendor of the profuse blossoms. Conceive,closely congregated, a million of the largest and most resplendenttulips! Only thus can the reader get any idea of the picture I wouldconvey. And then the stately grace of the clean, delicately-granulatedcolumnar stems, the largest four feet in diameter, at twenty from theground. The innumerable blossoms, mingling with those of other treesscarcely less beautiful, although infinitely less majestic, filled thevalley with more than Arabian perfumes.The general floor of the amphitheatre was grass of the same character asthat I had found in the road; if anything, more deliciously soft, thick,velvety, and miraculously green. It was hard to conceive how all thisbeauty had been attained.I have spoken of two openings into the vale. From the one to thenorthwest issued a rivulet, which came, gently murmuring and slightlyfoaming, down the ravine, until it dashed against the group of rocks outof which sprang the insulated hickory. Here, after encircling the tree,it passed on a little to the north of east, leaving the tulip tree sometwenty feet to the south, and making no decided alteration in its courseuntil it came near the midway between the eastern and western boundariesof the valley. At this point, after a series of sweeps, it turned off atright angles and pursued a generally southern direction meandering as itwent--until it became lost in a small lake of irregular figure (althoughroughly oval), that lay gleaming near the lower extremity of the vale.This lakelet was, perhaps, a hundred yards in diameter at its widestpart. No crystal could be clearer than its waters. Its bottom, whichcould be distinctly seen, consisted altogether, of pebbles brilliantlywhite. Its banks, of the emerald grass already described, rounded,rather than sloped, off into the clear heaven below; and so clear wasthis heaven, so perfectly, at times, did it reflect all objects aboveit, that where the true bank ended and where the mimic one commenced,it was a point of no little difficulty to determine. The trout, andsome other varieties of fish, with which this pond seemed to be almostinconveniently crowded, had all the appearance of veritable flying-fish.It was almost impossible to believe that they were not absolutelysuspended in the air. A light birch canoe that lay placidly on thewater, was reflected in its minutest fibres with a fidelity unsurpassedby the most exquisitely polished mirror. A small island, fairly laughingwith flowers in full bloom, and affording little more space than justenough for a picturesque little building, seemingly a fowl-house--arosefrom the lake not far from its northern shore--to which it was connectedby means of an inconceivably light-looking and yet very primitivebridge. It was formed of a single, broad and thick plank of the tulipwood. This was forty feet long, and spanned the interval between shoreand shore with a slight but very perceptible arch, preventing alloscillation. From the southern extreme of the lake issued a continuationof the rivulet, which, after meandering for, perhaps, thirty yards,finally passed through the &quot;depression&quot; (already described) in themiddle of the southern declivity, and tumbling down a sheer precipice ofa hundred feet, made its devious and unnoticed way to the Hudson.The lake was deep--at some points thirty feet--but the rivulet seldomexceeded three, while its greatest width was about eight. Its bottom andbanks were as those of the pond--if a defect could have been attributed,in point of picturesqueness, it was that of excessive neatness.The expanse of the green turf was relieved, here and there, by anoccasional showy shrub, such as the hydrangea, or the common snowball,or the aromatic seringa; or, more frequently, by a clump of geraniumsblossoming gorgeously in great varieties. These latter grew in potswhich were carefully buried in the soil, so as to give the plants theappearance of being indigenous. Besides all this, the lawn's velvet wasexquisitely spotted with sheep--a considerable flock of which roamedabout the vale, in company with three tamed deer, and a vast number ofbrilliantly-plumed ducks. A very large mastiff seemed to be in vigilantattendance upon these animals, each and all.Along the eastern and western cliffs--where, toward the upper portion ofthe amphitheatre, the boundaries were more or less precipitous--grew ivyin great profusion--so that only here and there could even a glimpse ofthe naked rock be obtained. The northern precipice, in like manner,was almost entirely clothed by grape-vines of rare luxuriance; somespringing from the soil at the base of the cliff, and others from ledgeson its face.The slight elevation which formed the lower boundary of this littledomain, was crowned by a neat stone wall, of sufficient height toprevent the escape of the deer. Nothing of the fence kind was observableelsewhere; for nowhere else was an artificial enclosure needed:--anystray sheep, for example, which should attempt to make its way out ofthe vale by means of the ravine, would find its progress arrested,after a few yards' advance, by the precipitous ledge of rock over whichtumbled the cascade that had arrested my attention as I first drew nearthe domain. In short, the only ingress or egress was through a gateoccupying a rocky pass in the road, a few paces below the point at whichI stopped to reconnoitre the scene.I have described the brook as meandering very irregularly through thewhole of its course. Its two general directions, as I have said, werefirst from west to east, and then from north to south. At the turn, thestream, sweeping backward, made an almost circular loop, so as to form apeninsula which was very nearly an island, and which included about thesixteenth of an acre. On this peninsula stood a dwelling-house--and whenI say that this house, like the infernal terrace seen by Vathek, &quot;etaitd'une architecture inconnue dans les annales de la terre,&quot; I mean,merely, that its tout ensemble struck me with the keenest sense ofcombined novelty and propriety--in a word, of poetry--(for, than in thewords just employed, I could scarcely give, of poetry in the abstract,a more rigorous definition)--and I do not mean that merely outre wasperceptible in any respect.In fact nothing could well be more simple--more utterly unpretendingthan this cottage. Its marvellous effect lay altogether in its artisticarrangement as a picture. I could have fancied, while I looked at it,that some eminent landscape-painter had built it with his brush.The point of view from which I first saw the valley, was not altogether,although it was nearly, the best point from which to survey the house.I will therefore describe it as I afterwards saw it--from a position onthe stone wall at the southern extreme of the amphitheatre.The main building was about twenty-four feet long and sixteenbroad--certainly not more. Its total height, from the ground to the apexof the roof, could not have exceeded eighteen feet. To the west endof this structure was attached one about a third smaller in all itsproportions:--the line of its front standing back about two yards fromthat of the larger house, and the line of its roof, of course, beingconsiderably depressed below that of the roof adjoining. At right anglesto these buildings, and from the rear of the main one--not exactly inthe middle--extended a third compartment, very small--being, in general,one-third less than the western wing. The roofs of the two larger werevery steep--sweeping down from the ridge-beam with a long concave curve,and extending at least four feet beyond the walls in front, so as toform the roofs of two piazzas. These latter roofs, of course, neededno support; but as they had the air of needing it, slight and perfectlyplain pillars were inserted at the corners alone. The roof of thenorthern wing was merely an extension of a portion of the main roof.Between the chief building and western wing arose a very tall and ratherslender square chimney of hard Dutch bricks, alternately black andred:--a slight cornice of projecting bricks at the top. Over the gablesthe roofs also projected very much:--in the main building about fourfeet to the east and two to the west. The principal door was not exactlyin the main division, being a little to the east--while the two windowswere to the west. These latter did not extend to the floor, but weremuch longer and narrower than usual--they had single shutters likedoors--the panes were of lozenge form, but quite large. The door itselfhad its upper half of glass, also in lozenge panes--a movable shuttersecured it at night. The door to the west wing was in its gable, andquite simple--a single window looked out to the south. There was noexternal door to the north wing, and it also had only one window to theeast.The blank wall of the eastern gable was relieved by stairs (with abalustrade) running diagonally across it--the ascent being from thesouth. Under cover of the widely projecting eave these steps gave accessto a door leading to the garret, or rather loft--for it was lighted onlyby a single window to the north, and seemed to have been intended as astore-room.The piazzas of the main building and western wing had no floors, as isusual; but at the doors and at each window, large, flat irregular slabsof granite lay imbedded in the delicious turf, affording comfortablefooting in all weather. Excellent paths of the same material--not nicelyadapted, but with the velvety sod filling frequent intervals between thestones, led hither and thither from the house, to a crystal spring aboutfive paces off, to the road, or to one or two out-houses that lay tothe north, beyond the brook, and were thoroughly concealed by a fewlocusts and catalpas.Not more than six steps from the main door of the cottage stood thedead trunk of a fantastic pear-tree, so clothed from head to foot inthe gorgeous bignonia blossoms that one required no little scrutiny todetermine what manner of sweet thing it could be. From various arms ofthis tree hung cages of different kinds. In one, a large wicker cylinderwith a ring at top, revelled a mocking bird; in another an oriole; in athird the impudent bobolink--while three or four more delicate prisonswere loudly vocal with canaries.The pillars of the piazza were enwreathed in jasmine and sweethoneysuckle; while from the angle formed by the main structure andits west wing, in front, sprang a grape-vine of unexampled luxuriance.Scorning all restraint, it had clambered first to the lower roof--thento the higher; and along the ridge of this latter it continued to writheon, throwing out tendrils to the right and left, until at length itfairly attained the east gable, and fell trailing over the stairs.The whole house, with its wings, was constructed of the old-fashionedDutch shingles--broad, and with unrounded corners. It is a peculiarityof this material to give houses built of it the appearance of beingwider at bottom than at top--after the manner of Egyptian architecture;and in the present instance, this exceedingly picturesque effect wasaided by numerous pots of gorgeous flowers that almost encompassed thebase of the buildings.The shingles were painted a dull gray; and the happiness with which thisneutral tint melted into the vivid green of the tulip tree leaves thatpartially overshadowed the cottage, can readily be conceived by anartist.From the position near the stone wall, as described, the buildingswere seen at great advantage--for the southeastern angle was thrownforward--so that the eye took in at once the whole of the two fronts,with the picturesque eastern gable, and at the same time obtained just asufficient glimpse of the northern wing, with parts of a pretty roofto the spring-house, and nearly half of a light bridge that spanned thebrook in the near vicinity of the main buildings.I did not remain very long on the brow of the hill, although long enoughto make a thorough survey of the scene at my feet. It was clear thatI had wandered from the road to the village, and I had thus goodtraveller's excuse to open the gate before me, and inquire my way, atall events; so, without more ado, I proceeded.The road, after passing the gate, seemed to lie upon a natural ledge,sloping gradually down along the face of the north-eastern cliffs. Itled me on to the foot of the northern precipice, and thence over thebridge, round by the eastern gable to the front door. In this progress,I took notice that no sight of the out-houses could be obtained.As I turned the corner of the gable, the mastiff bounded towards me instern silence, but with the eye and the whole air of a tiger. I held himout my hand, however, in token of amity--and I never yet knew the dogwho was proof against such an appeal to his courtesy. He not onlyshut his mouth and wagged his tail, but absolutely offered me hispaw--afterward extending his civilities to Ponto.As no bell was discernible, I rapped with my stick against thedoor, which stood half open. Instantly a figure advanced to thethreshold--that of a young woman about twenty-eight years ofage--slender, or rather slight, and somewhat above the medium height.As she approached, with a certain modest decision of step altogetherindescribable. I said to myself, &quot;Surely here I have found theperfection of natural, in contradistinction from artificial grace.&quot; Thesecond impression which she made on me, but by far the more vivid ofthe two, was that of enthusiasm. So intense an expression of romance,perhaps I should call it, or of unworldliness, as that which gleamedfrom her deep-set eyes, had never so sunk into my heart of heartsbefore. I know not how it is, but this peculiar expression of the eye,wreathing itself occasionally into the lips, is the most powerful,if not absolutely the sole spell, which rivets my interest in woman.&quot;Romance,&quot; provided my readers fully comprehended what I would here implyby the word--&quot;romance&quot; and &quot;womanliness&quot; seem to me convertible terms:and, after all, what man truly loves in woman, is simply her womanhood.The eyes of Annie (I heard some one from the interior call her &quot;Annie,darling!&quot;) were &quot;spiritual grey;&quot; her hair, a light chestnut: this isall I had time to observe of her.At her most courteous of invitations, I entered--passing first into atolerably wide vestibule. Having come mainly to observe, I took noticethat to my right as I stepped in, was a window, such as those in frontof the house; to the left, a door leading into the principal room;while, opposite me, an open door enabled me to see a small apartment,just the size of the vestibule, arranged as a study, and having a largebow window looking out to the north.Passing into the parlor, I found myself with Mr. Landor--for this,I afterwards found, was his name. He was civil, even cordial in hismanner, but just then, I was more intent on observing the arrangementsof the dwelling which had so much interested me, than the personalappearance of the tenant.The north wing, I now saw, was a bed-chamber, its door opened into theparlor. West of this door was a single window, looking toward the brook.At the west end of the parlor, were a fireplace, and a door leading intothe west wing--probably a kitchen.Nothing could be more rigorously simple than the furniture of theparlor. On the floor was an ingrain carpet, of excellent texture--awhite ground, spotted with small circular green figures. At the windowswere curtains of snowy white jaconet muslin: they were tolerably full,and hung decisively, perhaps rather formally in sharp, parallel plaitsto the floor--just to the floor. The walls were prepared with a Frenchpaper of great delicacy, a silver ground, with a faint green cordrunning zig-zag throughout. Its expanse was relieved merely by threeof Julien's exquisite lithographs a trois crayons, fastened to the wallwithout frames. One of these drawings was a scene of Oriental luxury, orrather voluptuousness; another was a &quot;carnival piece,&quot; spiritedbeyond compare; the third was a Greek female head--a face so divinelybeautiful, and yet of an expression so provokingly indeterminate, neverbefore arrested my attention.The more substantial furniture consisted of a round table, a few chairs(including a large rocking-chair), and a sofa, or rather &quot;settee;&quot; itsmaterial was plain maple painted a creamy white, slightly interstripedwith green; the seat of cane. The chairs and table were &quot;to match,&quot; butthe forms of all had evidently been designed by the same brain whichplanned &quot;the grounds;&quot; it is impossible to conceive anything moregraceful.On the table were a few books, a large, square, crystal bottle of somenovel perfume, a plain ground-glass astral (not solar) lamp with anItalian shade, and a large vase of resplendently-blooming flowers.Flowers, indeed, of gorgeous colours and delicate odour formed the solemere decoration of the apartment. The fire-place was nearly filled witha vase of brilliant geranium. On a triangular shelf in each angle of theroom stood also a similar vase, varied only as to its lovely contents.One or two smaller bouquets adorned the mantel, and late violetsclustered about the open windows.It is not the purpose of this work to do more than give in detail, apicture of Mr. Landor's residence--as I found it. How he made it what itwas--and why--with some particulars of Mr. Landor himself--may, possiblyform the subject of another article.WILLIAM WILSON    What say of it? what say of CONSCIENCE grim,    That spectre in my path?                   _Chamberlayne's Pharronida._LET me call myself, for the present, William Wilson. The fair page nowlying before me need not be sullied with my real appellation. This hasbeen already too much an object for the scorn--for the horror--for thedetestation of my race. To the uttermost regions of the globe have notthe indignant winds bruited its unparalleled infamy? Oh, outcast of alloutcasts most abandoned!--to the earth art thou not forever dead? to itshonors, to its flowers, to its golden aspirations?--and a cloud, dense,dismal, and limitless, does it not hang eternally between thy hopes andheaven?I would not, if I could, here or to-day, embody a record of my lateryears of unspeakable misery, and unpardonable crime. This epoch--theselater years--took unto themselves a sudden elevation in turpitude, whoseorigin alone it is my present purpose to assign. Men usually grow baseby degrees. From me, in an instant, all virtue dropped bodily as amantle. From comparatively trivial wickedness I passed, with the strideof a giant, into more than the enormities of an Elah-Gabalus. Whatchance--what one event brought this evil thing to pass, bear with mewhile I relate. Death approaches; and the shadow which foreruns him hasthrown a softening influence over my spirit. I long, in passing throughthe dim valley, for the sympathy--I had nearly said for the pity--ofmy fellow men. I would fain have them believe that I have been, in somemeasure, the slave of circumstances beyond human control. I would wishthem to seek out for me, in the details I am about to give, somelittle oasis of fatality amid a wilderness of error. I would have themallow--what they cannot refrain from allowing--that, although temptationmay have erewhile existed as great, man was never thus, at least,tempted before--certainly, never thus fell. And is it therefore that hehas never thus suffered? Have I not indeed been living in a dream? Andam I not now dying a victim to the horror and the mystery of the wildestof all sublunary visions?I am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily excitabletemperament has at all times rendered them remarkable; and, in myearliest infancy, I gave evidence of having fully inherited the familycharacter. As I advanced in years it was more strongly developed;becoming, for many reasons, a cause of serious disquietude to myfriends, and of positive injury to myself. I grew self-willed, addictedto the wildest caprices, and a prey to the most ungovernable passions.Weak-minded, and beset with constitutional infirmities akin to my own,my parents could do but little to check the evil propensities whichdistinguished me. Some feeble and ill-directed efforts resulted incomplete failure on their part, and, of course, in total triumph onmine. Thenceforward my voice was a household law; and at an age whenfew children have abandoned their leading-strings, I was left to theguidance of my own will, and became, in all but name, the master of myown actions.My earliest recollections of a school-life, are connected with a large,rambling, Elizabethan house, in a misty-looking village of England,where were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees, and where allthe houses were excessively ancient. In truth, it was a dream-likeand spirit-soothing place, that venerable old town. At this moment, infancy, I feel the refreshing chilliness of its deeply-shadowed avenues,inhale the fragrance of its thousand shrubberies, and thrill anewwith undefinable delight, at the deep hollow note of the church-bell,breaking, each hour, with sullen and sudden roar, upon the stillness ofthe dusky atmosphere in which the fretted Gothic steeple lay imbeddedand asleep.It gives me, perhaps, as much of pleasure as I can now in any mannerexperience, to dwell upon minute recollections of the school and itsconcerns. Steeped in misery as I am--misery, alas! only too real--Ishall be pardoned for seeking relief, however slight and temporary,in the weakness of a few rambling details. These, moreover, utterlytrivial, and even ridiculous in themselves, assume, to my fancy,adventitious importance, as connected with a period and a locality whenand where I recognise the first ambiguous monitions of the destiny whichafterwards so fully overshadowed me. Let me then remember.The house, I have said, was old and irregular. The grounds wereextensive, and a high and solid brick wall, topped with a bed of mortarand broken glass, encompassed the whole. This prison-like rampart formedthe limit of our domain; beyond it we saw but thrice a week--once everySaturday afternoon, when, attended by two ushers, we were permitted totake brief walks in a body through some of the neighbouring fields--andtwice during Sunday, when we were paraded in the same formal manner tothe morning and evening service in the one church of the village. Ofthis church the principal of our school was pastor. With how deep aspirit of wonder and perplexity was I wont to regard him from our remotepew in the gallery, as, with step solemn and slow, he ascended thepulpit! This reverend man, with countenance so demurely benign,with robes so glossy and so clerically flowing, with wig so minutelypowdered, so rigid and so vast,---could this be he who, of late, withsour visage, and in snuffy habiliments, administered, ferule in hand,the Draconian laws of the academy? Oh, gigantic paradox, too utterlymonstrous for solution!At an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate. It wasriveted and studded with iron bolts, and surmounted with jagged ironspikes. What impressions of deep awe did it inspire! It was neveropened save for the three periodical egressions and ingressions alreadymentioned; then, in every creak of its mighty hinges, we found aplenitude of mystery--a world of matter for solemn remark, or for moresolemn meditation.The extensive enclosure was irregular in form, having many capaciousrecesses. Of these, three or four of the largest constituted theplay-ground. It was level, and covered with fine hard gravel. I wellremember it had no trees, nor benches, nor anything similar withinit. Of course it was in the rear of the house. In front lay a smallparterre, planted with box and other shrubs; but through this sacreddivision we passed only upon rare occasions indeed--such as a firstadvent to school or final departure thence, or perhaps, when a parentor friend having called for us, we joyfully took our way home for theChristmas or Midsummer holy-days.But the house!--how quaint an old building was this!--to me howveritably a palace of enchantment! There was really no end to itswindings--to its incomprehensible subdivisions. It was difficult, atany given time, to say with certainty upon which of its two storiesone happened to be. From each room to every other there were sure to befound three or four steps either in ascent or descent. Then the lateralbranches were innumerable--inconceivable--and so returning in uponthemselves, that our most exact ideas in regard to the whole mansionwere not very far different from those with which we pondered uponinfinity. During the five years of my residence here, I was never ableto ascertain with precision, in what remote locality lay the littlesleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen or twenty otherscholars.The school-room was the largest in the house--I could not help thinking,in the world. It was very long, narrow, and dismally low, with pointedGothic windows and a ceiling of oak. In a remote and terror-inspiringangle was a square enclosure of eight or ten feet, comprising thesanctum, &quot;during hours,&quot; of our principal, the Reverend Dr. Bransby. Itwas a solid structure, with massy door, sooner than open which in theabsence of the &quot;Dominic,&quot; we would all have willingly perished by thepeine forte et dure. In other angles were two other similar boxes, farless reverenced, indeed, but still greatly matters of awe. One ofthese was the pulpit of the &quot;classical&quot; usher, one of the &quot;English andmathematical.&quot; Interspersed about the room, crossing and recrossingin endless irregularity, were innumerable benches and desks, black,ancient, and time-worn, piled desperately with much-bethumbed books,and so beseamed with initial letters, names at full length, grotesquefigures, and other multiplied efforts of the knife, as to have entirelylost what little of original form might have been their portion in dayslong departed. A huge bucket with water stood at one extremity of theroom, and a clock of stupendous dimensions at the other.Encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy, I passed, yetnot in tedium or disgust, the years of the third lustrum of my life.The teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of incident tooccupy or amuse it; and the apparently dismal monotony of a school wasreplete with more intense excitement than my riper youth has derivedfrom luxury, or my full manhood from crime. Yet I must believe that myfirst mental development had in it much of the uncommon--even much ofthe outre. Upon mankind at large the events of very early existencerarely leave in mature age any definite impression. All is grayshadow--a weak and irregular remembrance--an indistinct regathering offeeble pleasures and phantasmagoric pains. With me this is not so. Inchildhood I must have felt with the energy of a man what I now findstamped upon memory in lines as vivid, as deep, and as durable as theexergues of the Carthaginian medals.Yet in fact--in the fact of the world's view--how little was thereto remember! The morning's awakening, the nightly summons to bed;the connings, the recitations; the periodical half-holidays, andperambulations; the play-ground, with its broils, its pastimes, itsintrigues;--these, by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were made toinvolve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich incident, anuniverse of varied emotion, of excitement the most passionate andspirit-stirring. &quot;Oh, le bon temps, que ce siecle de fer!&quot;In truth, the ardor, the enthusiasm, and the imperiousness of mydisposition, soon rendered me a marked character among my schoolmates,and by slow, but natural gradations, gave me an ascendancy over allnot greatly older than myself;--over all with a single exception.This exception was found in the person of a scholar, who, althoughno relation, bore the same Christian and surname as myself;--acircumstance, in fact, little remarkable; for, notwithstanding a nobledescent, mine was one of those everyday appellations which seem, byprescriptive right, to have been, time out of mind, the common propertyof the mob. In this narrative I have therefore designated myself asWilliam Wilson,--a fictitious title not very dissimilar to the real.My namesake alone, of those who in school phraseology constituted &quot;ourset,&quot; presumed to compete with me in the studies of the class--in thesports and broils of the play-ground--to refuse implicit belief in myassertions, and submission to my will--indeed, to interfere with myarbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever. If there is on earth asupreme and unqualified despotism, it is the despotism of a master mindin boyhood over the less energetic spirits of its companions.Wilson's rebellion was to me a source of the greatestembarrassment;--the more so as, in spite of the bravado with which inpublic I made a point of treating him and his pretensions, I secretlyfelt that I feared him, and could not help thinking the equality whichhe maintained so easily with myself, a proof of his true superiority;since not to be overcome cost me a perpetual struggle. Yet thissuperiority--even this equality--was in truth acknowledged by no one butmyself; our associates, by some unaccountable blindness, seemed not evento suspect it. Indeed, his competition, his resistance, and especiallyhis impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes, were not morepointed than private. He appeared to be destitute alike of the ambitionwhich urged, and of the passionate energy of mind which enabled me toexcel. In his rivalry he might have been supposed actuated solely by awhimsical desire to thwart, astonish, or mortify myself; although therewere times when I could not help observing, with a feeling made up ofwonder, abasement, and pique, that he mingled with his injuries, hisinsults, or his contradictions, a certain most inappropriate, andassuredly most unwelcome affectionateness of manner. I could onlyconceive this singular behavior to arise from a consummate self-conceitassuming the vulgar airs of patronage and protection.Perhaps it was this latter trait in Wilson's conduct, conjoined with ouridentity of name, and the mere accident of our having entered the schoolupon the same day, which set afloat the notion that we were brothers,among the senior classes in the academy. These do not usually inquirewith much strictness into the affairs of their juniors. I have beforesaid, or should have said, that Wilson was not, in the most remotedegree, connected with my family. But assuredly if we had been brotherswe must have been twins; for, after leaving Dr. Bransby's, I casuallylearned that my namesake was born on the nineteenth of January,1813--and this is a somewhat remarkable coincidence; for the day isprecisely that of my own nativity.It may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety occasioned meby the rivalry of Wilson, and his intolerable spirit of contradiction,I could not bring myself to hate him altogether. We had, to be sure,nearly every day a quarrel in which, yielding me publicly the palm ofvictory, he, in some manner, contrived to make me feel that it was hewho had deserved it; yet a sense of pride on my part, and a veritabledignity on his own, kept us always upon what are called &quot;speakingterms,&quot; while there were many points of strong congeniality in ourtempers, operating to awake me in a sentiment which our position alone,perhaps, prevented from ripening into friendship. It is difficult,indeed, to define, or even to describe, my real feelings towardshim. They formed a motley and heterogeneous admixture;--some petulantanimosity, which was not yet hatred, some esteem, more respect, muchfear, with a world of uneasy curiosity. To the moralist it will beunnecessary to say, in addition, that Wilson and myself were the mostinseparable of companions.It was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between us,which turned all my attacks upon him, (and they were many, either openor covert) into the channel of banter or practical joke (giving painwhile assuming the aspect of mere fun) rather than into a more seriousand determined hostility. But my endeavours on this head were by nomeans uniformly successful, even when my plans were the most wittilyconcocted; for my namesake had much about him, in character, of thatunassuming and quiet austerity which, while enjoying the poignancy ofits own jokes, has no heel of Achilles in itself, and absolutely refusesto be laughed at. I could find, indeed, but one vulnerable point,and that, lying in a personal peculiarity, arising, perhaps, fromconstitutional disease, would have been spared by any antagonist lessat his wit's end than myself;--my rival had a weakness in the faucal orguttural organs, which precluded him from raising his voice at any timeabove a very low whisper. Of this defect I did not fail to take whatpoor advantage lay in my power.Wilson's retaliations in kind were many; and there was one form of hispractical wit that disturbed me beyond measure. How his sagacity firstdiscovered at all that so petty a thing would vex me, is a question Inever could solve; but, having discovered, he habitually practised theannoyance. I had always felt aversion to my uncourtly patronymic, andits very common, if not plebeian praenomen. The words were venom in myears; and when, upon the day of my arrival, a second William Wilson camealso to the academy, I felt angry with him for bearing the name, anddoubly disgusted with the name because a stranger bore it, who wouldbe the cause of its twofold repetition, who would be constantly in mypresence, and whose concerns, in the ordinary routine of the schoolbusiness, must inevitably, on account of the detestable coincidence, beoften confounded with my own.The feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with everycircumstance tending to show resemblance, moral or physical, between myrival and myself. I had not then discovered the remarkable fact that wewere of the same age; but I saw that we were of the same height, andI perceived that we were even singularly alike in general contour ofperson and outline of feature. I was galled, too, by the rumor touchinga relationship, which had grown current in the upper forms. In a word,nothing could more seriously disturb me, (although I scrupulouslyconcealed such disturbance,) than any allusion to a similarity of mind,person, or condition existing between us. But, in truth, I had no reasonto believe that (with the exception of the matter of relationship, andin the case of Wilson himself,) this similarity had ever been made asubject of comment, or even observed at all by our schoolfellows. Thathe observed it in all its bearings, and as fixedly as I, was apparent;but that he could discover in such circumstances so fruitful a field ofannoyance, can only be attributed, as I said before, to his more thanordinary penetration.His cue, which was to perfect an imitation of myself, lay both in wordsand in actions; and most admirably did he play his part. My dress itwas an easy matter to copy; my gait and general manner were, withoutdifficulty, appropriated; in spite of his constitutional defect, even myvoice did not escape him. My louder tones were, of course, unattempted,but then the key, it was identical; and his singular whisper, it grewthe very echo of my own.How greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me, (for it couldnot justly be termed a caricature,) I will not now venture to describe.I had but one consolation--in the fact that the imitation, apparently,was noticed by myself alone, and that I had to endure only the knowingand strangely sarcastic smiles of my namesake himself. Satisfied withhaving produced in my bosom the intended effect, he seemed to chucklein secret over the sting he had inflicted, and was characteristicallydisregardful of the public applause which the success of his wittyendeavours might have so easily elicited. That the school, indeed, didnot feel his design, perceive its accomplishment, and participate inhis sneer, was, for many anxious months, a riddle I could notresolve. Perhaps the gradation of his copy rendered it not so readilyperceptible; or, more possibly, I owed my security to the master air ofthe copyist, who, disdaining the letter, (which in a painting is allthe obtuse can see,) gave but the full spirit of his original for myindividual contemplation and chagrin.I have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of patronagewhich he assumed toward me, and of his frequent officious interferencewith my will. This interference often took the ungracious character ofadvice; advice not openly given, but hinted or insinuated. I received itwith a repugnance which gained strength as I grew in years. Yet, at thisdistant day, let me do him the simple justice to acknowledge that I canrecall no occasion when the suggestions of my rival were on the sideof those errors or follies so usual to his immature age and seeminginexperience; that his moral sense, at least, if not his general talentsand worldly wisdom, was far keener than my own; and that I might,to-day, have been a better, and thus a happier man, had I lessfrequently rejected the counsels embodied in those meaning whisperswhich I then but too cordially hated and too bitterly despised.As it was, I at length grew restive in the extreme under his distastefulsupervision, and daily resented more and more openly what I consideredhis intolerable arrogance. I have said that, in the first years of ourconnexion as schoolmates, my feelings in regard to him might havebeen easily ripened into friendship: but, in the latter months of myresidence at the academy, although the intrusion of his ordinary mannerhad, beyond doubt, in some measure, abated, my sentiments, in nearlysimilar proportion, partook very much of positive hatred. Upon oneoccasion he saw this, I think, and afterwards avoided, or made a show ofavoiding me.It was about the same period, if I remember aright, that, in analtercation of violence with him, in which he was more than usuallythrown off his guard, and spoke and acted with an openness of demeanorrather foreign to his nature, I discovered, or fancied I discovered,in his accent, his air, and general appearance, a something which firststartled, and then deeply interested me, by bringing to mind dim visionsof my earliest infancy--wild, confused and thronging memories of atime when memory herself was yet unborn. I cannot better describe thesensation which oppressed me than by saying that I could with difficultyshake off the belief of my having been acquainted with the being whostood before me, at some epoch very long ago--some point of the pasteven infinitely remote. The delusion, however, faded rapidly as it came;and I mention it at all but to define the day of the last conversation Ithere held with my singular namesake.The huge old house, with its countless subdivisions, had several largechambers communicating with each other, where slept the greater numberof the students. There were, however, (as must necessarily happen in abuilding so awkwardly planned,) many little nooks or recesses, theodds and ends of the structure; and these the economic ingenuity of Dr.Bransby had also fitted up as dormitories; although, being the merestclosets, they were capable of accommodating but a single individual. Oneof these small apartments was occupied by Wilson.One night, about the close of my fifth year at the school, andimmediately after the altercation just mentioned, finding every onewrapped in sleep, I arose from bed, and, lamp in hand, stole through awilderness of narrow passages from my own bedroom to that of my rival. Ihad long been plotting one of those ill-natured pieces of practical witat his expense in which I had hitherto been so uniformly unsuccessful.It was my intention, now, to put my scheme in operation, and I resolvedto make him feel the whole extent of the malice with which I was imbued.Having reached his closet, I noiselessly entered, leaving the lamp, witha shade over it, on the outside. I advanced a step, and listened tothe sound of his tranquil breathing. Assured of his being asleep, Ireturned, took the light, and with it again approached the bed. Closecurtains were around it, which, in the prosecution of my plan, Islowly and quietly withdrew, when the bright rays fell vividly uponthe sleeper, and my eyes, at the same moment, upon his countenance. Ilooked;--and a numbness, an iciness of feeling instantly pervaded myframe. My breast heaved, my knees tottered, my whole spirit becamepossessed with an objectless yet intolerable horror. Gasping forbreath, I lowered the lamp in still nearer proximity to the face. Werethese--these the lineaments of William Wilson? I saw, indeed, that theywere his, but I shook as if with a fit of the ague in fancying theywere not. What was there about them to confound me in this manner? Igazed;--while my brain reeled with a multitude of incoherent thoughts.Not thus he appeared--assuredly not thus--in the vivacity of his wakinghours. The same name! the same contour of person! the same day ofarrival at the academy! And then his dogged and meaningless imitationof my gait, my voice, my habits, and my manner! Was it, in truth, withinthe bounds of human possibility, that what I now saw was the result,merely, of the habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation?Awe-stricken, and with a creeping shudder, I extinguished the lamp,passed silently from the chamber, and left, at once, the halls of thatold academy, never to enter them again.After a lapse of some months, spent at home in mere idleness, I foundmyself a student at Eton. The brief interval had been sufficient toenfeeble my remembrance of the events at Dr. Bransby's, or at leastto effect a material change in the nature of the feelings with whichI remembered them. The truth--the tragedy--of the drama was no more.I could now find room to doubt the evidence of my senses; and seldomcalled up the subject at all but with wonder at extent of humancredulity, and a smile at the vivid force of the imagination which Ihereditarily possessed. Neither was this species of scepticism likely tobe diminished by the character of the life I led at Eton. The vortex ofthoughtless folly into which I there so immediately and so recklesslyplunged, washed away all but the froth of my past hours, engulfed atonce every solid or serious impression, and left to memory only theveriest levities of a former existence.I do not wish, however, to trace the course of my miserable profligacyhere--a profligacy which set at defiance the laws, while it eludedthe vigilance of the institution. Three years of folly, passed withoutprofit, had but given me rooted habits of vice, and added, in a somewhatunusual degree, to my bodily stature, when, after a week of soullessdissipation, I invited a small party of the most dissolute students to asecret carousal in my chambers. We met at a late hour of the night; forour debaucheries were to be faithfully protracted until morning. Thewine flowed freely, and there were not wanting other and perhaps moredangerous seductions; so that the gray dawn had already faintly appearedin the east, while our delirious extravagance was at its height. Madlyflushed with cards and intoxication, I was in the act of insisting upona toast of more than wonted profanity, when my attention was suddenlydiverted by the violent, although partial unclosing of the door of theapartment, and by the eager voice of a servant from without. He saidthat some person, apparently in great haste, demanded to speak with mein the hall.Wildly excited with wine, the unexpected interruption rather delightedthan surprised me. I staggered forward at once, and a few steps broughtme to the vestibule of the building. In this low and small room therehung no lamp; and now no light at all was admitted, save that of theexceedingly feeble dawn which made its way through the semi-circularwindow. As I put my foot over the threshold, I became aware of thefigure of a youth about my own height, and habited in a white kerseymeremorning frock, cut in the novel fashion of the one I myself wore at themoment. This the faint light enabled me to perceive; but the features ofhis face I could not distinguish. Upon my entering he strode hurriedlyup to me, and, seizing me by the arm with a gesture of petulantimpatience, whispered the words &quot;William Wilson!&quot; in my ear.I grew perfectly sober in an instant. There was that in the manner ofthe stranger, and in the tremulous shake of his uplifted finger, as heheld it between my eyes and the light, which filled me with unqualifiedamazement; but it was not this which had so violently moved me. Itwas the pregnancy of solemn admonition in the singular, low, hissingutterance; and, above all, it was the character, the tone, the key, ofthose few, simple, and familiar, yet whispered syllables, which camewith a thousand thronging memories of bygone days, and struck upon mysoul with the shock of a galvanic battery. Ere I could recover the useof my senses he was gone.Although this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my disorderedimagination, yet was it evanescent as vivid. For some weeks, indeed, Ibusied myself in earnest inquiry, or was wrapped in a cloud of morbidspeculation. I did not pretend to disguise from my perception theidentity of the singular individual who thus perseveringly interferedwith my affairs, and harassed me with his insinuated counsel. Butwho and what was this Wilson?--and whence came he?--and what were hispurposes? Upon neither of these points could I be satisfied; merelyascertaining, in regard to him, that a sudden accident in his family hadcaused his removal from Dr. Bransby's academy on the afternoon of theday in which I myself had eloped. But in a brief period I ceasedto think upon the subject; my attention being all absorbed ina contemplated departure for Oxford. Thither I soon went; theuncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me with an outfit andannual establishment, which would enable me to indulge at will inthe luxury already so dear to my heart,--to vie in profuseness ofexpenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the wealthiest earldoms inGreat Britain.Excited by such appliances to vice, my constitutional temperament brokeforth with redoubled ardor, and I spurned even the common restraints ofdecency in the mad infatuation of my revels. But it were absurd topause in the detail of my extravagance. Let it suffice, that amongspendthrifts I out-Heroded Herod, and that, giving name to a multitudeof novel follies, I added no brief appendix to the long catalogue ofvices then usual in the most dissolute university of Europe.It could hardly be credited, however, that I had, even here, so utterlyfallen from the gentlemanly estate, as to seek acquaintance with thevilest arts of the gambler by profession, and, having become an adeptin his despicable science, to practise it habitually as a means ofincreasing my already enormous income at the expense of the weak-mindedamong my fellow-collegians. Such, nevertheless, was the fact. And thevery enormity of this offence against all manly and honourable sentimentproved, beyond doubt, the main if not the sole reason of the impunitywith which it was committed. Who, indeed, among my most abandonedassociates, would not rather have disputed the clearest evidence of hissenses, than have suspected of such courses, the gay, the frank, thegenerous William Wilson--the noblest and most liberal commoner at Oxford--himwhose follies (said his parasites) were but the follies of youth andunbridled fancy--whose errors but inimitable whim--whose darkest vicebut a careless and dashing extravagance?I had been now two years successfully busied in this way, when therecame to the university a young parvenu nobleman, Glendinning--rich, saidreport, as Herodes Atticus--his riches, too, as easily acquired. I soonfound him of weak intellect, and, of course, marked him as a fittingsubject for my skill. I frequently engaged him in play, and contrived,with the gambler's usual art, to let him win considerable sums, the moreeffectually to entangle him in my snares. At length, my schemes beingripe, I met him (with the full intention that this meeting should befinal and decisive) at the chambers of a fellow-commoner, (Mr. Preston,)equally intimate with both, but who, to do him Justice, entertainednot even a remote suspicion of my design. To give to this a bettercolouring, I had contrived to have assembled a party of some eight orten, and was solicitously careful that the introduction of cards shouldappear accidental, and originate in the proposal of my contemplateddupe himself. To be brief upon a vile topic, none of the low finesse wasomitted, so customary upon similar occasions that it is a just matterfor wonder how any are still found so besotted as to fall its victim.We had protracted our sitting far into the night, and I had at lengtheffected the manoeuvre of getting Glendinning as my sole antagonist. Thegame, too, was my favorite ecarte! The rest of the company, interestedin the extent of our play, had abandoned their own cards, and werestanding around us as spectators. The parvenu, who had been inducedby my artifices in the early part of the evening, to drink deeply, nowshuffled, dealt, or played, with a wild nervousness of manner for whichhis intoxication, I thought, might partially, but could not altogetheraccount. In a very short period he had become my debtor to a largeamount, when, having taken a long draught of port, he did preciselywhat I had been coolly anticipating--he proposed to double our alreadyextravagant stakes. With a well-feigned show of reluctance, and notuntil after my repeated refusal had seduced him into some angry wordswhich gave a color of pique to my compliance, did I finally comply. Theresult, of course, did but prove how entirely the prey was in my toils;in less than an hour he had quadrupled his debt. For some time hiscountenance had been losing the florid tinge lent it by the wine; butnow, to my astonishment, I perceived that it had grown to a pallor trulyfearful. I say to my astonishment. Glendinning had been represented tomy eager inquiries as immeasurably wealthy; and the sums which he hadas yet lost, although in themselves vast, could not, I supposed, veryseriously annoy, much less so violently affect him. That he was overcomeby the wine just swallowed, was the idea which most readily presenteditself; and, rather with a view to the preservation of my own characterin the eyes of my associates, than from any less interested motive, Iwas about to insist, peremptorily, upon a discontinuance of the play,when some expressions at my elbow from among the company, and anejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of Glendinning, gave meto understand that I had effected his total ruin under circumstanceswhich, rendering him an object for the pity of all, should haveprotected him from the ill offices even of a fiend.What now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say. The pitiablecondition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed gloom over all;and, for some moments, a profound silence was maintained, during which Icould not help feeling my cheeks tingle with the many burning glancesof scorn or reproach cast upon me by the less abandoned of the party.I will even own that an intolerable weight of anxiety was for abrief instant lifted from my bosom by the sudden and extraordinaryinterruption which ensued. The wide, heavy folding doors of theapartment were all at once thrown open, to their full extent, with avigorous and rushing impetuosity that extinguished, as if by magic,every candle in the room. Their light, in dying, enabled us just toperceive that a stranger had entered, about my own height, and closelymuffled in a cloak. The darkness, however, was now total; and we couldonly feel that he was standing in our midst. Before any one of us couldrecover from the extreme astonishment into which this rudeness hadthrown all, we heard the voice of the intruder.&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; he said, in a low, distinct, and never-to-be-forgottenwhisper which thrilled to the very marrow of my bones, &quot;Gentlemen, Imake no apology for this behaviour, because in thus behaving, I ambut fulfilling a duty. You are, beyond doubt, uninformed of the truecharacter of the person who has to-night won at ecarte a large sumof money from Lord Glendinning. I will therefore put you upon anexpeditious and decisive plan of obtaining this very necessaryinformation. Please to examine, at your leisure, the inner linings ofthe cuff of his left sleeve, and the several little packages which maybe found in the somewhat capacious pockets of his embroidered morningwrapper.&quot;While he spoke, so profound was the stillness that one might have hearda pin drop upon the floor. In ceasing, he departed at once, and asabruptly as he had entered. Can I--shall I describe my sensations?--mustI say that I felt all the horrors of the damned? Most assuredly I hadlittle time given for reflection. Many hands roughly seized me upon thespot, and lights were immediately reprocured. A search ensued. In thelining of my sleeve were found all the court cards essential in ecarte,and, in the pockets of my wrapper, a number of packs, facsimiles ofthose used at our sittings, with the single exception that mine were ofthe species called, technically, arrondees; the honours being slightlyconvex at the ends, the lower cards slightly convex at the sides. Inthis disposition, the dupe who cuts, as customary, at the length of thepack, will invariably find that he cuts his antagonist an honor; whilethe gambler, cutting at the breadth, will, as certainly, cut nothing forhis victim which may count in the records of the game.Any burst of indignation upon this discovery would have affected me lessthan the silent contempt, or the sarcastic composure, with which it wasreceived.&quot;Mr. Wilson,&quot; said our host, stooping to remove from beneath his feetan exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs, &quot;Mr. Wilson, this is yourproperty.&quot; (The weather was cold; and, upon quitting my own room, I hadthrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper, putting it off upon reachingthe scene of play.) &quot;I presume it is supererogatory to seek here (eyeingthe folds of the garment with a bitter smile) for any farther evidenceof your skill. Indeed, we have had enough. You will see the necessity,I hope, of quitting Oxford--at all events, of quitting instantly mychambers.&quot;Abased, humbled to the dust as I then was, it is probable that I shouldhave resented this galling language by immediate personal violence, hadnot my whole attention been at the moment arrested by a fact of themost startling character. The cloak which I had worn was of a raredescription of fur; how rare, how extravagantly costly, I shall notventure to say. Its fashion, too, was of my own fantastic invention; forI was fastidious to an absurd degree of coxcombry, in matters of thisfrivolous nature. When, therefore, Mr. Preston reached me that whichhe had picked up upon the floor, and near the folding doors of theapartment, it was with an astonishment nearly bordering upon terror,that I perceived my own already hanging on my arm, (where I had no doubtunwittingly placed it,) and that the one presented me was but its exactcounterpart in every, in even the minutest possible particular. Thesingular being who had so disastrously exposed me, had been muffled,I remembered, in a cloak; and none had been worn at all by any ofthe members of our party with the exception of myself. Retaining somepresence of mind, I took the one offered me by Preston; placed it,unnoticed, over my own; left the apartment with a resolute scowl ofdefiance; and, next morning ere dawn of day, commenced a hurried journeyfrom Oxford to the continent, in a perfect agony of horror and of shame.I fled in vain. My evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation, andproved, indeed, that the exercise of its mysterious dominion had as yetonly begun. Scarcely had I set foot in Paris ere I had fresh evidence ofthe detestable interest taken by this Wilson in my concerns. Years flew,while I experienced no relief. Villain!--at Rome, with how untimely,yet with how spectral an officiousness, stepped he in between me and myambition! At Vienna, too--at Berlin--and at Moscow! Where, in truth, hadI not bitter cause to curse him within my heart? From his inscrutabletyranny did I at length flee, panic-stricken, as from a pestilence; andto the very ends of the earth I fled in vain.And again, and again, in secret communion with my own spirit, wouldI demand the questions &quot;Who is he?--whence came he?--and what are hisobjects?&quot; But no answer was there found. And then I scrutinized, with aminute scrutiny, the forms, and the methods, and the leading traits ofhis impertinent supervision. But even here there was very little uponwhich to base a conjecture. It was noticeable, indeed, that, in no oneof the multiplied instances in which he had of late crossed my path, hadhe so crossed it except to frustrate those schemes, or to disturb thoseactions, which, if fully carried out, might have resulted in bittermischief. Poor justification this, in truth, for an authority soimperiously assumed! Poor indemnity for natural rights of self-agency sopertinaciously, so insultingly denied!I had also been forced to notice that my tormentor, for a very longperiod of time, (while scrupulously and with miraculous dexteritymaintaining his whim of an identity of apparel with myself,) had socontrived it, in the execution of his varied interference with my will,that I saw not, at any moment, the features of his face. Be Wilson whathe might, this, at least, was but the veriest of affectation, or offolly. Could he, for an instant, have supposed that, in my admonisherat Eton--in the destroyer of my honor at Oxford,--in him who thwarted myambition at Rome, my revenge at Paris, my passionate love at Naples, orwhat he falsely termed my avarice in Egypt,--that in this, my arch-enemyand evil genius, could fail to recognise the William Wilson of myschool boy days,--the namesake, the companion, the rival,--the hated anddreaded rival at Dr. Bransby's? Impossible!--But let me hasten to thelast eventful scene of the drama.Thus far I had succumbed supinely to this imperious domination. Thesentiment of deep awe with which I habitually regarded the elevatedcharacter, the majestic wisdom, the apparent omnipresence andomnipotence of Wilson, added to a feeling of even terror, with whichcertain other traits in his nature and assumptions inspired me, hadoperated, hitherto, to impress me with an idea of my own utter weaknessand helplessness, and to suggest an implicit, although bitterlyreluctant submission to his arbitrary will. But, of late days, I hadgiven myself up entirely to wine; and its maddening influence upon myhereditary temper rendered me more and more impatient of control. Ibegan to murmur,--to hesitate,--to resist. And was it only fancy whichinduced me to believe that, with the increase of my own firmness, thatof my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution? Be this as it may,I now began to feel the inspiration of a burning hope, and at lengthnurtured in my secret thoughts a stern and desperate resolution that Iwould submit no longer to be enslaved.It was at Rome, during the Carnival of 18--, that I attended amasquerade in the palazzo of the Neapolitan Duke Di Broglio. I hadindulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the wine-table; andnow the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded rooms irritated me beyondendurance. The difficulty, too, of forcing my way through the mazes ofthe company contributed not a little to the ruffling of my temper; forI was anxiously seeking, (let me not say with what unworthy motive) theyoung, the gay, the beautiful wife of the aged and doting Di Broglio.With a too unscrupulous confidence she had previously communicated to methe secret of the costume in which she would be habited, and now, havingcaught a glimpse of her person, I was hurrying to make my way into herpresence.--At this moment I felt a light hand placed upon my shoulder,and that ever-remembered, low, damnable whisper within my ear.In an absolute phrenzy of wrath, I turned at once upon him who had thusinterrupted me, and seized him violently by the collar. He was attired,as I had expected, in a costume altogether similar to my own; wearing aSpanish cloak of blue velvet, begirt about the waist with a crimson beltsustaining a rapier. A mask of black silk entirely covered his face.&quot;Scoundrel!&quot; I said, in a voice husky with rage, while every syllableI uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury, &quot;scoundrel! impostor! accursedvillain! you shall not--you shall not dog me unto death! Follow me, or Istab you where you stand!&quot;--and I broke my way from the ball-room intoa small ante-chamber adjoining--dragging him unresistingly with me as Iwent.Upon entering, I thrust him furiously from me. He staggered against thewall, while I closed the door with an oath, and commanded him to draw.He hesitated but for an instant; then, with a slight sigh, drew insilence, and put himself upon his defence.The contest was brief indeed. I was frantic with every species of wildexcitement, and felt within my single arm the energy and power of amultitude. In a few seconds I forced him by sheer strength against thewainscoting, and thus, getting him at mercy, plunged my sword, withbrute ferocity, repeatedly through and through his bosom.At that instant some person tried the latch of the door. I hastenedto prevent an intrusion, and then immediately returned to my dyingantagonist. But what human language can adequately portray thatastonishment, that horror which possessed me at the spectacle thenpresented to view? The brief moment in which I averted my eyes had beensufficient to produce, apparently, a material change in the arrangementsat the upper or farther end of the room. A large mirror,--so at first itseemed to me in my confusion--now stood where none had been perceptiblebefore; and, as I stepped up to it in extremity of terror, mine ownimage, but with features all pale and dabbled in blood, advanced to meetme with a feeble and tottering gait.Thus it appeared, I say, but was not. It was my antagonist--it wasWilson, who then stood before me in the agonies of his dissolution.His mask and cloak lay, where he had thrown them, upon the floor. Nota thread in all his raiment--not a line in all the marked and singularlineaments of his face which was not, even in the most absoluteidentity, mine own!It was Wilson; but he spoke no longer in a whisper, and I could havefancied that I myself was speaking while he said:&quot;You have conquered, and I yield. Yet, henceforward art thou alsodead--dead to the World, to Heaven and to Hope! In me didst thouexist--and, in my death, see by this image, which is thine own, howutterly thou hast murdered thyself.&quot;THE TELL-TALE HEART.TRUE!--nervous--very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; butwhy will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses--notdestroyed--not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. Iheard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many thingsin hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily--howcalmly I can tell you the whole story.It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but onceconceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passionthere was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He hadnever given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was hiseye! yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture--a pale blue eye,with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; andso by degrees--very gradually--I made up my mind to take the life of theold man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But youshould have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded--withwhat caution--with what foresight--with what dissimulation I went towork! I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole weekbefore I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latchof his door and opened it--oh so gently! And then, when I had made anopening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed,closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh,you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved itslowly--very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man'ssleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening sofar that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman havebeen so wise as this? And then, when my head was well in the room, Iundid the lantern cautiously--oh, so cautiously--cautiously (for thehinges creaked)--I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fellupon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights--every nightjust at midnight--but I found the eye always closed; and so it wasimpossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, buthis Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly intothe chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in ahearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you see hewould have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that everynight, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening thedoor. A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Neverbefore that night had I felt the extent of my own powers--of mysagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To thinkthat there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even todream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; andperhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled.Now you may think that I drew back--but no. His room was as black aspitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened,through fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see theopening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumbslipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, cryingout--&quot;Who's there?&quot;I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move amuscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was stillsitting up in the bed listening;--just as I have done, night afternight, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortalterror. It was not a groan of pain or of grief--oh, no!--it was the lowstifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overchargedwith awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, whenall the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, withits dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well.I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled atheart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slightnoise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever sincegrowing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but couldnot. He had been saying to himself--&quot;It is nothing but the wind in thechimney--it is only a mouse crossing the floor,&quot; or &quot;It is merely acricket which has made a single chirp.&quot; Yes, he had been trying tocomfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain.All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with hisblack shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was themournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him tofeel--although he neither saw nor heard--to feel the presence of my headwithin the room.When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him liedown, I resolved to open a little--a very, very little crevice inthe lantern. So I opened it--you cannot imagine how stealthily,stealthily--until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of thespider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye.It was open--wide, wide open--and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. Isaw it with perfect distinctness--all a dull blue, with a hideousveil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could seenothing else of the old man's face or person: for I had directed the rayas if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is butover-acuteness of the sense?--now, I say, there came to my ears a low,dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. Iknew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man's heart. Itincreased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier intocourage.But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held thelantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray uponthe eve. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grewquicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old man'sterror must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder everymoment!--do you mark me well I have told you that I am nervous: so I am.And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence ofthat old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollableterror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still. Butthe beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. And nowa new anxiety seized me--the sound would be heard by a neighbour! Theold man's hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lanternand leaped into the room. He shrieked once--once only. In an instantI dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I thensmiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, theheart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; itwould not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old manwas dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone,stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there manyminutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye wouldtrouble me no more.If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describethe wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The nightwaned, and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I dismemberedthe corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs.I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, anddeposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards socleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye--not even his--could havedetected any thing wrong. There was nothing to wash out--no stain of anykind--no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub hadcaught all--ha! ha!When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock--still darkas midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at thestreet door. I went down to open it with a light heart,--for what hadI now to fear? There entered three men, who introduced themselves, withperfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard bya neighbour during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused;information had been lodged at the police office, and they (theofficers) had been deputed to search the premises.I smiled,--for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. Theshriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, wasabsent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house. I badethem search--search well. I led them, at length, to his chamber. Ishowed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm ofmy confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them hereto rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity ofmy perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath whichreposed the corpse of the victim.The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I wassingularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, theychatted of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting paleand wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in myears: but still they sat and still chatted. The ringing became moredistinct:--It continued and became more distinct: I talked morefreely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gaineddefiniteness--until, at length, I found that the noise was not within myears.No doubt I now grew _very_ pale;--but I talked more fluently, and with aheightened voice. Yet the sound increased--and what could I do? It wasa low, dull, quick sound--much such a sound as a watch makes whenenveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath--and yet the officers heardit not. I talked more quickly--more vehemently; but the noise steadilyincreased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and withviolent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why wouldthey not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as ifexcited to fury by the observations of the men--but the noise steadilyincreased. Oh God! what could I do? I foamed--I raved--I swore! I swungthe chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon theboards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. Itgrew louder--louder--louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, andsmiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God!--no, no! Theyheard!--they suspected!--they knew!--they were making a mockery of myhorror!-this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better thanthis agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bearthose hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die!and now--again!--hark! louder! louder! louder! louder!&quot;Villains!&quot; I shrieked, &quot;dissemble no more! I admit the deed!--tear upthe planks! here, here!--It is the beating of his hideous heart!&quot;BERENICE     Dicebant mihi sodales, si sepulchrum amicae visitarem, curas     meas aliquantulum forelevatas.                                 --_Ebn Zaiat_.MISERY is manifold. The wretchedness of earth is multiform. Overreachingthe wide horizon as the rainbow, its hues are as various as the hues ofthat arch--as distinct too, yet as intimately blended. Overreaching thewide horizon as the rainbow! How is it that from beauty I have deriveda type of unloveliness?--from the covenant of peace, a simile of sorrow?But as, in ethics, evil is a consequence of good, so, in fact, out ofjoy is sorrow born. Either the memory of past bliss is the anguish ofto-day, or the agonies which _are_, have their origin in the ecstasieswhich _might have been_.My baptismal name is Egaeus; that of my family I will not mention. Yetthere are no towers in the land more time-honored than my gloomy, gray,hereditary halls. Our line has been called a race of visionaries; andin many striking particulars--in the character of the familymansion--in the frescos of the chief saloon--in the tapestries of thedormitories--in the chiselling of some buttresses in the armory--butmore especially in the gallery of antique paintings--in the fashion ofthe library chamber--and, lastly, in the very peculiar nature of thelibrary's contents--there is more than sufficient evidence to warrantthe belief.The recollections of my earliest years are connected with that chamber,and with its volumes--of which latter I will say no more. Here died mymother. Herein was I born. But it is mere idleness to say that I had notlived before--that the soul has no previous existence. You deny it?--letus not argue the matter. Convinced myself, I seek not to convince. Thereis, however, a remembrance of aerial forms--of spiritual and meaningeyes--of sounds, musical yet sad--a remembrance which will not beexcluded; a memory like a shadow--vague, variable, indefinite, unsteady;and like a shadow, too, in the impossibility of my getting rid of itwhile the sunlight of my reason shall exist.In that chamber was I born. Thus awaking from the long night of whatseemed, but was not, nonentity, at once into the very regions of fairyland--into a palace of imagination--into the wild dominions of monasticthought and erudition--it is not singular that I gazed around me with astartled and ardent eye--that I loitered away my boyhood in books,and dissipated my youth in reverie; but it _is_ singular that as yearsrolled away, and the noon of manhood found me still in the mansion of myfathers--it _is_ wonderful what stagnation there fell upon the springsof my life--wonderful how total an inversion took place in the characterof my commonest thought. The realities of the world affected me asvisions, and as visions only, while the wild ideas of the land of dreamsbecame, in turn, not the material of my every-day existence, but in verydeed that existence utterly and solely in itself.* * * * *Berenice and I were cousins, and we grew up together in my paternalhalls. Yet differently we grew--I, ill of health, and buried ingloom--she, agile, graceful, and overflowing with energy; hers, theramble on the hill-side--mine the studies of the cloister; I, livingwithin my own heart, and addicted, body and soul, to the most intenseand painful meditation--she, roaming carelessly through life, withno thought of the shadows in her path, or the silent flight of theraven-winged hours. Berenice!--I call upon her name--Berenice!--andfrom the gray ruins of memory a thousand tumultuous recollections arestartled at the sound! Ah, vividly is her image before me now, as in theearly days of her light-heartedness and joy! Oh, gorgeous yet fantasticbeauty! Oh, sylph amid the shrubberies of Arnheim! Oh, Naiad among itsfountains! And then--then all is mystery and terror, and a tale whichshould not be told. Disease--a fatal disease, fell like the simoon uponher frame; and, even while I gazed upon her, the spirit of change sweptover her, pervading her mind, her habits, and her character, and, in amanner the most subtle and terrible, disturbing even the identity ofher person! Alas! the destroyer came and went!--and the victim--where isshe? I knew her not--or knew her no longer as Berenice.Among the numerous train of maladies superinduced by that fatal andprimary one which effected a revolution of so horrible a kind in themoral and physical being of my cousin, may be mentioned as the mostdistressing and obstinate in its nature, a species of epilepsy notunfrequently terminating in _trance_ itself--trance very nearlyresembling positive dissolution, and from which her manner of recoverywas in most instances, startlingly abrupt. In the mean time my owndisease--for I have been told that I should call it by no otherappellation--my own disease, then, grew rapidly upon me, and assumedfinally a monomaniac character of a novel and extraordinary form--hourlyand momently gaining vigor--and at length obtaining over me the mostincomprehensible ascendancy. This monomania, if I must so term it,consisted in a morbid irritability of those properties of the mind inmetaphysical science termed the _attentive_. It is more than probablethat I am not understood; but I fear, indeed, that it is in no mannerpossible to convey to the mind of the merely general reader, an adequateidea of that nervous _intensity of interest_ with which, in my case,the powers of meditation (not to speak technically) busied and buriedthemselves, in the contemplation of even the most ordinary objects ofthe universe.To muse for long unwearied hours, with my attention riveted to somefrivolous device on the margin, or in the typography of a book; tobecome absorbed, for the better part of a summer's day, in a quaintshadow falling aslant upon the tapestry or upon the floor; to losemyself, for an entire night, in watching the steady flame of a lamp,or the embers of a fire; to dream away whole days over the perfume of aflower; to repeat, monotonously, some common word, until the sound, bydint of frequent repetition, ceased to convey any idea whatever to themind; to lose all sense of motion or physical existence, by means ofabsolute bodily quiescence long and obstinately persevered in: suchwere a few of the most common and least pernicious vagaries induced by acondition of the mental faculties, not, indeed, altogether unparalleled,but certainly bidding defiance to anything like analysis or explanation.Yet let me not be misapprehended. The undue, earnest, and morbidattention thus excited by objects in their own nature frivolous, mustnot be confounded in character with that ruminating propensity commonto all mankind, and more especially indulged in by persons of ardentimagination. It was not even, as might be at first supposed, an extremecondition, or exaggeration of such propensity, but primarily andessentially distinct and different. In the one instance, the dreamer,or enthusiast, being interested by an object usually _not_ frivolous,imperceptibly loses sight of this object in a wilderness of deductionsand suggestions issuing therefrom, until, at the conclusion of a daydream _often replete with luxury_, he finds the _incitamentum_, or firstcause of his musings, entirely vanished and forgotten. In my case, theprimary object was _invariably frivolous_, although assuming, throughthe medium of my distempered vision, a refracted and unreal importance.Few deductions, if any, were made; and those few pertinaciouslyreturning in upon the original object as a centre. The meditations were_never_ pleasurable; and, at the termination of the reverie, the firstcause, so far from being out of sight, had attained that supernaturallyexaggerated interest which was the prevailing feature of the disease. Ina word, the powers of mind more particularly exercised were, with me, asI have said before, the _attentive_, and are, with the day-dreamer, the_speculative_.My books, at this epoch, if they did not actually serve to irritate thedisorder, partook, it will be perceived, largely, in their imaginativeand inconsequential nature, of the characteristic qualities of thedisorder itself. I well remember, among others, the treatise of thenoble Italian, Coelius Secundus Curio, &quot;_De Amplitudine Beati RegniDei;_&quot; St. Austin's great work, the &quot;City of God;&quot; and Tertullian's &quot;_DeCarne Christi_,&quot; in which the paradoxical sentence &quot;_Mortuus est Deifilius; credible est quia ineptum est: et sepultus resurrexit; certumest quia impossibile est,_&quot; occupied my undivided time, for many weeksof laborious and fruitless investigation.Thus it will appear that, shaken from its balance only by trivialthings, my reason bore resemblance to that ocean-crag spoken of byPtolemy Hephestion, which steadily resisting the attacks of humanviolence, and the fiercer fury of the waters and the winds, trembledonly to the touch of the flower called Asphodel. And although, toa careless thinker, it might appear a matter beyond doubt, that thealteration produced by her unhappy malady, in the _moral_ condition ofBerenice, would afford me many objects for the exercise of that intenseand abnormal meditation whose nature I have been at some trouble inexplaining, yet such was not in any degree the case. In the lucidintervals of my infirmity, her calamity, indeed, gave me pain, and,taking deeply to heart that total wreck of her fair and gentle life, Idid not fail to ponder, frequently and bitterly, upon the wonder-workingmeans by which so strange a revolution had been so suddenly broughtto pass. But these reflections partook not of the idiosyncrasy ofmy disease, and were such as would have occurred, under similarcircumstances, to the ordinary mass of mankind. True to its owncharacter, my disorder revelled in the less important but more startlingchanges wrought in the _physical_ frame of Berenice--in the singular andmost appalling distortion of her personal identity.During the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty, most surely I hadnever loved her. In the strange anomaly of my existence, feelings withme, _had never been_ of the heart, and my passions _always were_ of themind. Through the gray of the early morning--among the trellised shadowsof the forest at noonday--and in the silence of my library at night--shehad flitted by my eyes, and I had seen her--not as the living andbreathing Berenice, but as the Berenice of a dream; not as a being ofthe earth, earthy, but as the abstraction of such a being; not as athing to admire, but to analyze; not as an object of love, but asthe theme of the most abstruse although desultory speculation. And_now_--now I shuddered in her presence, and grew pale at her approach;yet, bitterly lamenting her fallen and desolate condition, I called tomind that she had loved me long, and, in an evil moment, I spoke to herof marriage.And at length the period of our nuptials was approaching, when, uponan afternoon in the winter of the year--one of those unseasonablywarm, calm, and misty days which are the nurse of the beautiful Halcyon(*1),--I sat, (and sat, as I thought, alone,) in the inner apartment ofthe library. But, uplifting my eyes, I saw that Berenice stood beforeme.Was it my own excited imagination--or the misty influence of theatmosphere--or the uncertain twilight of the chamber--or the graydraperies which fell around her figure--that caused in it so vacillatingand indistinct an outline? I could not tell. She spoke no word; andI--not for worlds could I have uttered a syllable. An icy chill ranthrough my frame; a sense of insufferable anxiety oppressed me; aconsuming curiosity pervaded my soul; and sinking back upon the chair,I remained for some time breathless and motionless, with my eyes rivetedupon her person. Alas! its emaciation was excessive, and not one vestigeof the former being lurked in any single line of the contour. My burningglances at length fell upon the face.The forehead was high, and very pale, and singularly placid; and theonce jetty hair fell partially over it, and overshadowed the hollowtemples with innumerable ringlets, now of a vivid yellow, and jarringdiscordantly, in their fantastic character, with the reigning melancholyof the countenance. The eyes were lifeless, and lustreless, andseemingly pupilless, and I shrank involuntarily from their glassy stareto the contemplation of the thin and shrunken lips. They parted; and in asmile of peculiar meaning, _the teeth_ of the changed Berenice disclosedthemselves slowly to my view. Would to God that I had never beheld them,or that, having done so, I had died!* * * * *The shutting of a door disturbed me, and, looking up, I found that mycousin had departed from the chamber. But from the disordered chamberof my brain, had not, alas! departed, and would not be driven away,the white and ghastly _spectrum_ of the teeth. Not a speck on theirsurface--not a shade on their enamel--not an indenture in theiredges--but what that period of her smile had sufficed to brand in uponmy memory. I saw them _now_ even more unequivocally than I beheldthem _then_. The teeth!--the teeth!--they were here, and there, andeverywhere, and visibly and palpably before me; long, narrow, andexcessively white, with the pale lips writhing about them, as in thevery moment of their first terrible development. Then came the fullfury of my _monomania_, and I struggled in vain against its strange andirresistible influence. In the multiplied objects of the external worldI had no thoughts but for the teeth. For these I longed with a phrenzieddesire. All other matters and all different interests became absorbed intheir single contemplation. They--they alone were present to the mentaleye, and they, in their sole individuality, became the essence ofmy mental life. I held them in every light. I turned them in everyattitude. I surveyed their characteristics. I dwelt upon theirpeculiarities. I pondered upon their conformation. I mused upon thealteration in their nature. I shuddered as I assigned to them inimagination a sensitive and sentient power, and even when unassisted bythe lips, a capability of moral expression. Of Mademoiselle Salle ithas been well said, &quot;_Que tous ses pas etaient des sentiments_,&quot; andof Berenice I more seriously believed _que toutes ses dents etaient desidees_. _Des idees!_--ah here was the idiotic thought that destroyed me!_Des idees!_--ah _therefore_ it was that I coveted them so madly! I feltthat their possession could alone ever restore me to peace, in giving meback to reason.And the evening closed in upon me thus--and then the darkness came, andtarried, and went--and the day again dawned--and the mists of a secondnight were now gathering around--and still I sat motionless in thatsolitary room--and still I sat buried in meditation--and still the_phantasma_ of the teeth maintained its terrible ascendancy, as, withthe most vivid hideous distinctness, it floated about amid the changinglights and shadows of the chamber. At length there broke in upon mydreams a cry as of horror and dismay; and thereunto, after a pause,succeeded the sound of troubled voices, intermingled with many lowmoanings of sorrow or of pain. I arose from my seat, and throwing openone of the doors of the library, saw standing out in the ante-chambera servant maiden, all in tears, who told me that Berenice was--no more!She had been seized with epilepsy in the early morning, and now, at theclosing in of the night, the grave was ready for its tenant, and all thepreparations for the burial were completed.* * * * *I found myself sitting in the library, and again sitting there alone. Itseemed that I had newly awakened from a confused and exciting dream.I knew that it was now midnight, and I was well aware, that since thesetting of the sun, Berenice had been interred. But of that drearyperiod which intervened I had no positive, at least no definitecomprehension. Yet its memory was replete with horror--horror morehorrible from being vague, and terror more terrible from ambiguity. Itwas a fearful page in the record my existence, written all over withdim, and hideous, and unintelligible recollections. I strived todecypher them, but in vain; while ever and anon, like the spirit of adeparted sound, the shrill and piercing shriek of a female voice seemedto be ringing in my ears. I had done a deed--what was it? I asked myselfthe question aloud, and the whispering echoes of the chamber answeredme,--&quot;_what was it?_&quot;On the table beside me burned a lamp, and near it lay a little box. Itwas of no remarkable character, and I had seen it frequently before, forit was the property of the family physician; but how came it _there_,upon my table, and why did I shudder in regarding it? These things werein no manner to be accounted for, and my eyes at length dropped to theopen pages of a book, and to a sentence underscored therein. The wordswere the singular but simple ones of the poet Ebn Zaiat:--&quot;_Dicebantmihi sodales si sepulchrum amicae visitarem, curas meas aliquantulumfore levatas_.&quot; Why then, as I perused them, did the hairs of my headerect themselves on end, and the blood of my body become congealedwithin my veins?There came a light tap at the library door--and, pale as the tenant of atomb, a menial entered upon tiptoe. His looks were wild with terror,and he spoke to me in a voice tremulous, husky, and very low. What saidhe?--some broken sentences I heard. He told of a wild cry disturbing thesilence of the night--of the gathering together of the household--ofa search in the direction of the sound; and then his tones grewthrillingly distinct as he whispered me of a violated grave--ofa disfigured body enshrouded, yet still breathing--stillpalpitating--_still alive_!He pointed to garments;--they were muddy and clotted with gore. I spokenot, and he took me gently by the hand: it was indented with the impressof human nails. He directed my attention to some object against thewall. I looked at it for some minutes: it was a spade. With a shriek Ibounded to the table, and grasped the box that lay upon it. But I couldnot force it open; and in my tremor, it slipped from my hands, and fellheavily, and burst into pieces; and from it, with a rattling sound,there rolled out some instruments of dental surgery, intermingled withthirty-two small, white and ivory-looking substances that were scatteredto and fro about the floor.ELEONORA     Sub conservatione formae specificae salva anima.                        _  Raymond Lully_.I AM come of a race noted for vigor of fancy and ardor of passion. Menhave called me mad; but the question is not yet settled, whethermadness is or is not the loftiest intelligence--whether much that isglorious--whether all that is profound--does not spring from diseaseof thought--from moods of mind exalted at the expense of the generalintellect. They who dream by day are cognizant of many things whichescape those who dream only by night. In their gray visions they obtainglimpses of eternity, and thrill, in awakening, to find that theyhave been upon the verge of the great secret. In snatches, they learnsomething of the wisdom which is of good, and more of the mere knowledgewhich is of evil. They penetrate, however, rudderless or compasslessinto the vast ocean of the &quot;light ineffable,&quot; and again, like theadventures of the Nubian geographer, &quot;agressi sunt mare tenebrarum, quidin eo esset exploraturi.&quot;We will say, then, that I am mad. I grant, at least, that there are twodistinct conditions of my mental existence--the condition of a lucidreason, not to be disputed, and belonging to the memory of eventsforming the first epoch of my life--and a condition of shadow and doubt,appertaining to the present, and to the recollection of what constitutesthe second great era of my being. Therefore, what I shall tell of theearlier period, believe; and to what I may relate of the later time,give only such credit as may seem due, or doubt it altogether, or, ifdoubt it ye cannot, then play unto its riddle the Oedipus.She whom I loved in youth, and of whom I now pen calmly and distinctlythese remembrances, was the sole daughter of the only sister of mymother long departed. Eleonora was the name of my cousin. We hadalways dwelled together, beneath a tropical sun, in the Valley of theMany-Colored Grass. No unguided footstep ever came upon that vale; forit lay away up among a range of giant hills that hung beetling aroundabout it, shutting out the sunlight from its sweetest recesses. No pathwas trodden in its vicinity; and, to reach our happy home, there wasneed of putting back, with force, the foliage of many thousands offorest trees, and of crushing to death the glories of many millions offragrant flowers. Thus it was that we lived all alone, knowing nothingof the world without the valley--I, and my cousin, and her mother.From the dim regions beyond the mountains at the upper end of ourencircled domain, there crept out a narrow and deep river, brighter thanall save the eyes of Eleonora; and, winding stealthily about in mazycourses, it passed away, at length, through a shadowy gorge, among hillsstill dimmer than those whence it had issued. We called it the &quot;Riverof Silence&quot;; for there seemed to be a hushing influence in its flow.No murmur arose from its bed, and so gently it wandered along, that thepearly pebbles upon which we loved to gaze, far down within its bosom,stirred not at all, but lay in a motionless content, each in its own oldstation, shining on gloriously forever.The margin of the river, and of the many dazzling rivulets that glidedthrough devious ways into its channel, as well as the spaces thatextended from the margins away down into the depths of the streams untilthey reached the bed of pebbles at the bottom,--these spots, not lessthan the whole surface of the valley, from the river to the mountainsthat girdled it in, were carpeted all by a soft green grass, thick,short, perfectly even, and vanilla-perfumed, but so besprinkledthroughout with the yellow buttercup, the white daisy, the purpleviolet, and the ruby-red asphodel, that its exceeding beauty spoke toour hearts in loud tones, of the love and of the glory of God.And, here and there, in groves about this grass, like wildernesses ofdreams, sprang up fantastic trees, whose tall slender stems stood notupright, but slanted gracefully toward the light that peered at noon-dayinto the centre of the valley. Their mark was speckled with the vividalternate splendor of ebony and silver, and was smoother than all savethe cheeks of Eleonora; so that, but for the brilliant green of the hugeleaves that spread from their summits in long, tremulous lines, dallyingwith the Zephyrs, one might have fancied them giant serpents of Syriadoing homage to their sovereign the Sun.Hand in hand about this valley, for fifteen years, roamed I withEleonora before Love entered within our hearts. It was one evening atthe close of the third lustrum of her life, and of the fourth of my own,that we sat, locked in each other's embrace, beneath the serpent-liketrees, and looked down within the water of the River of Silence at ourimages therein. We spoke no words during the rest of that sweet day, andour words even upon the morrow were tremulous and few. We had drawn theGod Eros from that wave, and now we felt that he had enkindled within usthe fiery souls of our forefathers. The passions which had for centuriesdistinguished our race, came thronging with the fancies for which theyhad been equally noted, and together breathed a delirious bliss overthe Valley of the Many-Colored Grass. A change fell upon all things.Strange, brilliant flowers, star-shaped, burn out upon the treeswhere no flowers had been known before. The tints of the green carpetdeepened; and when, one by one, the white daisies shrank away, theresprang up in place of them, ten by ten of the ruby-red asphodel. Andlife arose in our paths; for the tall flamingo, hitherto unseen, withall gay glowing birds, flaunted his scarlet plumage before us. Thegolden and silver fish haunted the river, out of the bosom of whichissued, little by little, a murmur that swelled, at length, into alulling melody more divine than that of the harp of Aeolus-sweeter thanall save the voice of Eleonora. And now, too, a voluminous cloud, whichwe had long watched in the regions of Hesper, floated out thence, allgorgeous in crimson and gold, and settling in peace above us, sank, dayby day, lower and lower, until its edges rested upon the tops of themountains, turning all their dimness into magnificence, and shutting usup, as if forever, within a magic prison-house of grandeur and of glory.The loveliness of Eleonora was that of the Seraphim; but she was amaiden artless and innocent as the brief life she had led among theflowers. No guile disguised the fervor of love which animated her heart,and she examined with me its inmost recesses as we walked togetherin the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass, and discoursed of the mightychanges which had lately taken place therein.At length, having spoken one day, in tears, of the last sad changewhich must befall Humanity, she thenceforward dwelt only upon this onesorrowful theme, interweaving it into all our converse, as, in the songsof the bard of Schiraz, the same images are found occurring, again andagain, in every impressive variation of phrase.She had seen that the finger of Death was upon her bosom--that, like theephemeron, she had been made perfect in loveliness only to die; butthe terrors of the grave to her lay solely in a consideration which sherevealed to me, one evening at twilight, by the banks of the River ofSilence. She grieved to think that, having entombed her in the Valleyof the Many-Colored Grass, I would quit forever its happy recesses,transferring the love which now was so passionately her own to somemaiden of the outer and everyday world. And, then and there, I threwmyself hurriedly at the feet of Eleonora, and offered up a vow, toherself and to Heaven, that I would never bind myself in marriage to anydaughter of Earth--that I would in no manner prove recreant to her dearmemory, or to the memory of the devout affection with which she hadblessed me. And I called the Mighty Ruler of the Universe to witness thepious solemnity of my vow. And the curse which I invoked of Him andof her, a saint in Helusion should I prove traitorous to that promise,involved a penalty the exceeding great horror of which will not permitme to make record of it here. And the bright eyes of Eleonora grewbrighter at my words; and she sighed as if a deadly burthen had beentaken from her breast; and she trembled and very bitterly wept; but shemade acceptance of the vow, (for what was she but a child?) and it madeeasy to her the bed of her death. And she said to me, not many daysafterward, tranquilly dying, that, because of what I had done forthe comfort of her spirit she would watch over me in that spirit whendeparted, and, if so it were permitted her return to me visibly in thewatches of the night; but, if this thing were, indeed, beyond the powerof the souls in Paradise, that she would, at least, give me frequentindications of her presence, sighing upon me in the evening winds, orfilling the air which I breathed with perfume from the censers of theangels. And, with these words upon her lips, she yielded up her innocentlife, putting an end to the first epoch of my own.Thus far I have faithfully said. But as I pass the barrier in Time'spath, formed by the death of my beloved, and proceed with the secondera of my existence, I feel that a shadow gathers over my brain, and Imistrust the perfect sanity of the record. But let me on.--Years draggedthemselves along heavily, and still I dwelled within the Valley of theMany-Colored Grass; but a second change had come upon all things. Thestar-shaped flowers shrank into the stems of the trees, and appeared nomore. The tints of the green carpet faded; and, one by one, the ruby-redasphodels withered away; and there sprang up, in place of them, tenby ten, dark, eye-like violets, that writhed uneasily and were everencumbered with dew. And Life departed from our paths; for the tallflamingo flaunted no longer his scarlet plumage before us, but flewsadly from the vale into the hills, with all the gay glowing birds thathad arrived in his company. And the golden and silver fish swam downthrough the gorge at the lower end of our domain and bedecked the sweetriver never again. And the lulling melody that had been softer thanthe wind-harp of Aeolus, and more divine than all save the voice ofEleonora, it died little by little away, in murmurs growing lower andlower, until the stream returned, at length, utterly, into the solemnityof its original silence. And then, lastly, the voluminous cloud uprose,and, abandoning the tops of the mountains to the dimness of old, fellback into the regions of Hesper, and took away all its manifold goldenand gorgeous glories from the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass.Yet the promises of Eleonora were not forgotten; for I heard the soundsof the swinging of the censers of the angels; and streams of a holyperfume floated ever and ever about the valley; and at lone hours, whenmy heart beat heavily, the winds that bathed my brow came unto me ladenwith soft sighs; and indistinct murmurs filled often the night air, andonce--oh, but once only! I was awakened from a slumber, like the slumberof death, by the pressing of spiritual lips upon my own.But the void within my heart refused, even thus, to be filled. I longedfor the love which had before filled it to overflowing. At length thevalley pained me through its memories of Eleonora, and I left it forever for the vanities and the turbulent triumphs of the world.I found myself within a strange city, where all things might have servedto blot from recollection the sweet dreams I had dreamed so long in theValley of the Many-Colored Grass. The pomps and pageantries of a statelycourt, and the mad clangor of arms, and the radiant loveliness of women,bewildered and intoxicated my brain. But as yet my soul had proved trueto its vows, and the indications of the presence of Eleonora were stillgiven me in the silent hours of the night. Suddenly these manifestationsthey ceased, and the world grew dark before mine eyes, and I stoodaghast at the burning thoughts which possessed, at the terribletemptations which beset me; for there came from some far, far distantand unknown land, into the gay court of the king I served, a maiden towhose beauty my whole recreant heart yielded at once--at whose footstoolI bowed down without a struggle, in the most ardent, in the most abjectworship of love. What, indeed, was my passion for the young girl ofthe valley in comparison with the fervor, and the delirium, and thespirit-lifting ecstasy of adoration with which I poured out my wholesoul in tears at the feet of the ethereal Ermengarde?--Oh, brightwas the seraph Ermengarde! and in that knowledge I had room for noneother.--Oh, divine was the angel Ermengarde! and as I looked down intothe depths of her memorial eyes, I thought only of them--and of her.I wedded;--nor dreaded the curse I had invoked; and its bitterness wasnot visited upon me. And once--but once again in the silence of thenight; there came through my lattice the soft sighs which had forsakenme; and they modelled themselves into familiar and sweet voice, saying:&quot;Sleep in peace!--for the Spirit of Love reigneth and ruleth, and, intaking to thy passionate heart her who is Ermengarde, thou art absolved,for reasons which shall be made known to thee in Heaven, of thy vowsunto Eleonora.&quot;NOTES TO THIS VOLUMENotes -- Scheherezade(*1) The coralites.(*2) &quot;One of the most remarkable natural curiosities in Texas is apetrified forest, near the head of Pasigno river. It consists of severalhundred trees, in an erect position, all turned to stone. Some trees,now growing, are partly petrified. This is a startling fact for naturalphilosophers, and must cause them to modify the existing theory ofpetrification.--_Kennedy_.This account, at first discredited, has since been corroborated by thediscovery of a completely petrified forest, near the head waters of theCheyenne, or Chienne river, which has its source in the Black Hills ofthe rocky chain.There is scarcely, perhaps, a spectacle on the surface of the globe moreremarkable, either in a geological or picturesque point of view thanthat presented by the petrified forest, near Cairo. The traveller,having passed the tombs of the caliphs, just beyond the gates of thecity, proceeds to the southward, nearly at right angles to the roadacross the desert to Suez, and after having travelled some ten miles upa low barren valley, covered with sand, gravel, and sea shells, fresh asif the tide had retired but yesterday, crosses a low range of sandhills,which has for some distance run parallel to his path. The scene nowpresented to him is beyond conception singular and desolate. A mass offragments of trees, all converted into stone, and when struck by hishorse's hoof ringing like cast iron, is seen to extend itself for milesand miles around him, in the form of a decayed and prostrate forest.The wood is of a dark brown hue, but retains its form in perfection, thepieces being from one to fifteen feet in length, and from half a foot tothree feet in thickness, strewed so closely together, as far as the eyecan reach, that an Egyptian donkey can scarcely thread its way throughamongst them, and so natural that, were it in Scotland or Ireland, itmight pass without remark for some enormous drained bog, on which theexhumed trees lay rotting in the sun. The roots and rudiments of thebranches are, in many cases, nearly perfect, and in some the worm-holeseaten under the bark are readily recognizable. The most delicate of thesap vessels, and all the finer portions of the centre of the wood, areperfectly entire, and bear to be examined with the strongest magnifiers.The whole are so thoroughly silicified as to scratch glass and arecapable of receiving the highest polish.-- _Asiatic Magazine_.(*3) The Mammoth Cave of Kentucky.(*4) In Iceland, 1783.(*5) &quot;During the eruption of Hecla, in 1766, clouds of this kindproduced such a degree of darkness that, at Glaumba, which is more thanfifty leagues from the mountain, people could only find their way bygroping.

On thefirst of May, 1812, a cloud of volcanic ashes and sand, coming from avolcano in the island of St. Vincent, covered the whole of Barbadoes,spreading over it so intense a darkness that, at mid-day, in the openair, one could not perceive the trees or other objects near him, oreven a white handkerchief placed at the distance of six inches from theeye._&quot;--Murray, p. 215, Phil. edit._(*6) In the year 1790, in the Caraccas during an earthquake a portion ofthe granite soil sank and left a lake eight hundred yards in diameter,and from eighty to a hundred feet deep.

Williams, of Salem, Mass._, presented the &quot;NationalInstitute&quot; with an insect from New Zealand, with the followingdescription: &quot;'_The Hotte_, a decided caterpillar, or worm, is foundgnawing at the root of the _Rota_ tree, with a plant growing out of itshead. This most peculiar and extraordinary insect travels up both the_Rota_ and _Ferriri_ trees, and entering into the top, eats its way,perforating the trunk of the trees until it reaches the root, and dies,or remains dormant, and the plant propagates out of its head; the bodyremains perfect and entire, of a harder substance than when alive. Fromthis insect the natives make a coloring for tattooing.(*13) In mines and natural caves we find a species of cryptogamous_fungus_ that emits an intense phosphorescence.(*14) The orchis, scabius and valisneria.(*15) The corolla of this flower (_Aristolochia Clematitis_), which istubular, but terminating upwards in a ligulate limb, is inflated into aglobular figure at the base. The tubular part is internally beset withstiff hairs, pointing downwards. The globular part contains thepistil, which consists merely of a germen and stigma, together with thesurrounding stamens. But the stamens, being shorter than the germen,cannot discharge the pollen so as to throw it upon the stigma, as theflower stands always upright till after impregnation. And hence, withoutsome additional and peculiar aid, the pollen must necessarily fan downto the bottom of the flower. Now, the aid that nature has furnished inthis case, is that of the _Tiputa Pennicornis_, a small insect, whichentering the tube of the corrolla in quest of honey, descends to thebottom, and rummages about till it becomes quite covered with pollen;but not being able to force its way out again, owing to the downwardposition of the hairs, which converge to a point like the wires of amouse-trap, and being somewhat impatient of its confinement it brushesbackwards and forwards, trying every corner, till, after repeatedlytraversing the stigma, it covers it with pollen sufficient for itsimpregnation, in consequence of which the flower soon begins to droop,and the hairs to shrink to the sides of the tube, effecting an easypassage for the escape of the insect.&quot;--_Rev. P. Keith-System ofPhysiological Botany_.(*16) The bees--ever since bees were--have been constructing theircells with just such sides, in just such number, and at just suchinclinations, as it has been demonstrated (in a problem involving theprofoundest mathematical principles) are the very sides, in the verynumber, and at the very angles, which will afford the creatures the mostroom that is compatible with the greatest stability of structure.During the latter part of the last century, the question arose amongmathematicians--&quot;to determine the best form that can be given to thesails of a windmill, according to their varying distances from therevolving vanes, and likewise from the centres of the revoloution.&quot; Thisis an excessively complex problem, for it is, in other words, to findthe best possible position at an infinity of varied distances and at aninfinity of points on the arm. There were a thousand futile attempts toanswer the query on the part of the most illustrious mathematicians, andwhen at length, an undeniable solution was discovered, men found thatthe wings of a bird had given it with absolute precision ever since thefirst bird had traversed the air.(*17) He observed a flock of pigeons passing betwixt Frankfort and theIndian territory, one mile at least in breadth; it took up four hoursin passing, which, at the rate of one mile per minute, gives a lengthof 240 miles; and, supposing three pigeons to each square yard, gives2,230,272,000 Pigeons.--&quot;_Travels in Canada and the United States,&quot; byLieut.

If two red rays from twoluminous points be admitted into a dark chamber so as to fall on awhite surface, and differ in their length by 0.0000258 of an inch,their intensity is doubled. So also if the difference in length be anywhole-number multiple of that fraction. A multiple by 2 1/4, 3 1/4, &amp;c.,gives an intensity equal to one ray only; but a multiple by 2 1/2, 31/2, &amp;c., gives the result of total darkness. In violet rays similareffects arise when the difference in length is 0.000157 of an inch; andwith all other rays the results are the same--the difference varyingwith a uniform increase from the violet to the red.&quot;Analogous experiments in respect to sound produce analogous results.&quot;(*32) Place a platina crucible over a spirit lamp, and keep it a redheat; pour in some sulphuric acid, which, though the most volatile ofbodies at a common temperature, will be found to become completely fixedin a hot crucible, and not a drop evaporates--being surrounded by anatmosphere of its own, it does not, in fact, touch the sides. A fewdrops of water are now introduced, when the acid, immediately coming incontact with the heated sides of the crucible, flies off in sulphurousacid vapor, and so rapid is its progress, that the caloric of the waterpasses off with it, which falls a lump of ice to the bottom; by takingadvantage of the moment before it is allowed to remelt, it may be turnedout a lump of ice from a red-hot vessel.(*33) The Daguerreotype.(*34) Although light travels 167,000 miles in a second, the distanceof 61 Cygni (the only star whose distance is ascertained) is soinconceivably great, that its rays would require more than ten years toreach the earth. For stars beyond this, 20--or even 1000 years--wouldbe a moderate estimate. Thus, if they had been annihilated 20, or 1000years ago, we might still see them to-day by the light which startedfrom their surfaces 20 or 1000 years in the past time.
