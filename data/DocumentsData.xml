With infinite complacency men went to&#10;and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their&#10;assurance of their empire over matter.  It is possible that the&#10;infusoria under the microscope do the same.  No one gave a thought to&#10;the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of&#10;them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or&#10;improbable.  It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of&#10;those departed days.  At most terrestrial men fancied there might be&#10;other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to&#10;welcome a missionary enterprise.  Yet across the gulf of space, minds&#10;that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish,&#10;intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with&#10;envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.  And&#10;early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment.&#10;&#10;The planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the&#10;sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it&#10;receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world.&#10;It must be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our&#10;world; and long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its&#10;surface must have begun its course.  The fact that it is scarcely one&#10;seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling&#10;to the temperature at which life could begin.  It has air and water&#10;and all that is necessary for the support of animated existence.&#10;&#10;Yet so vain is man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no writer,&#10;up to the very end of the nineteenth century, expressed any idea that&#10;intelligent life might have developed there far, or indeed at all,&#10;beyond its earthly level.  Nor was it generally understood that since&#10;Mars is older than our earth, with scarcely a quarter of the&#10;superficial area and remoter from the sun, it necessarily follows that&#10;it is not only more distant from time's beginning but nearer its end.&#10;&#10;The secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has&#10;already gone far indeed with our neighbour.  Its physical condition is&#10;still largely a mystery, but we know now that even in its equatorial&#10;region the midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldest&#10;winter.  Its air is much more attenuated than ours, its oceans have&#10;shrunk until they cover but a third of its surface, and as its slow&#10;seasons change huge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and&#10;periodically inundate its temperate zones.  That last stage of&#10;exhaustion, which to us is still incredibly remote, has become a&#10;present-day problem for the inhabitants of Mars.  The immediate&#10;pressure of necessity has brightened their intellects, enlarged their&#10;powers, and hardened their hearts.  And looking across space with&#10;instruments, and intelligences such as we have scarcely dreamed of,&#10;they see, at its nearest distance only 35,000,000 of miles sunward of&#10;them, a morning star of hope, our own warmer planet, green with&#10;vegetation and grey with water, with a cloudy atmosphere eloquent of&#10;fertility, with glimpses through its drifting cloud wisps of broad&#10;stretches of populous country and narrow, navy-crowded seas.&#10;&#10;And we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to them&#10;at least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us.  The&#10;intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant&#10;struggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is the belief&#10;of the minds upon Mars.  Their world is far gone in its cooling and&#10;this world is still crowded with life, but crowded only with what they&#10;regard as inferior animals.  To carry warfare sunward is, indeed,&#10;their only escape from the destruction that, generation after&#10;generation, creeps upon them.&#10;&#10;And before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what&#10;ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only&#10;upon animals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its&#10;inferior races.  The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness,&#10;were entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged&#10;by European immigrants, in the space of fifty years.  Are we such&#10;apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same&#10;spirit?&#10;&#10;The Martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing&#10;subtlety--their mathematical learning is evidently far in excess of&#10;ours--and to have carried out their preparations with a well-nigh&#10;perfect unanimity.  Had our instruments permitted it, we might have&#10;seen the gathering trouble far back in the nineteenth century.  Men&#10;like Schiaparelli watched the red planet--it is odd, by-the-bye, that&#10;for countless centuries Mars has been the star of war--but failed to&#10;interpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so&#10;well.  All that time the Martians must have been getting ready.&#10;&#10;During the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen on the&#10;illuminated part of the disk, first at the Lick Observatory, then by&#10;Perrotin of Nice, and then by other observers.  English readers heard&#10;of it first in the issue of _Nature_ dated August 2.  I am inclined to&#10;think that this blaze may have been the casting of the huge gun, in&#10;the vast pit sunk into their planet, from which their shots were fired&#10;at us.  Peculiar markings, as yet unexplained, were seen near the site&#10;of that outbreak during the next two oppositions.&#10;&#10;The storm burst upon us six years ago now.  As Mars approached&#10;opposition, Lavelle of Java set the wires of the astronomical exchange&#10;palpitating with the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of&#10;incandescent gas upon the planet.  It had occurred towards midnight of&#10;the twelfth; and the spectroscope, to which he had at once resorted,&#10;indicated a mass of flaming gas, chiefly hydrogen, moving with an&#10;enormous velocity towards this earth.  This jet of fire had become&#10;invisible about a quarter past twelve.  He compared it to a colossal&#10;puff of flame suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet, &quot;as&#10;flaming gases rushed out of a gun.&quot;&#10;&#10;A singularly appropriate phrase it proved.  Yet the next day there&#10;was nothing of this in the papers except a little note in the _Daily&#10;Telegraph_, and the world went in ignorance of one of the gravest&#10;dangers that ever threatened the human race. I might not have heard of&#10;the eruption at all had I not met Ogilvy, the well-known astronomer,&#10;at Ottershaw.  He was immensely excited at the news, and in the excess&#10;of his feelings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in a&#10;scrutiny of the red planet.&#10;&#10;In spite of all that has happened since, I still remember that&#10;vigil very distinctly: the black and silent observatory, the shadowed&#10;lantern throwing a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner, the&#10;steady ticking of the clockwork of the telescope, the little slit in&#10;the roof--an oblong profundity with the stardust streaked across it.&#10;Ogilvy moved about, invisible but audible.  Looking through the&#10;telescope, one saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet&#10;swimming in the field.  It seemed such a little thing, so bright and&#10;small and still, faintly marked with transverse stripes, and slightly&#10;flattened from the perfect round.  But so little it was, so silvery&#10;warm--a pin's-head of light! It was as if it quivered, but really this&#10;was the telescope vibrating with the activity of the clockwork that&#10;kept the planet in view.&#10;&#10;As I watched, the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to&#10;advance and recede, but that was simply that my eye was tired.  Forty&#10;millions of miles it was from us--more than forty millions of miles of&#10;void.  Few people realise the immensity of vacancy in which the dust&#10;of the material universe swims.&#10;&#10;Near it in the field, I remember, were three faint points of light,&#10;three telescopic stars infinitely remote, and all around it was the&#10;unfathomable darkness of empty space.  You know how that blackness&#10;looks on a frosty starlight night.  In a telescope it seems far&#10;profounder.  And invisible to me because it was so remote and small,&#10;flying swiftly and steadily towards me across that incredible&#10;distance, drawing nearer every minute by so many thousands of miles,&#10;came the Thing they were sending us, the Thing that was to bring so&#10;much struggle and calamity and death to the earth.  I never dreamed of&#10;it then as I watched; no one on earth dreamed of that unerring&#10;missile.&#10;&#10;That night, too, there was another jetting out of gas from the&#10;distant planet.  I saw it.  A reddish flash at the edge, the slightest&#10;projection of the outline just as the chronometer struck midnight; and&#10;at that I told Ogilvy and he took my place.  The night was warm and I&#10;was thirsty, and I went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way&#10;in the darkness, to the little table where the siphon stood, while&#10;Ogilvy exclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us.&#10;&#10;That night another invisible missile started on its way to the&#10;earth from Mars, just a second or so under twenty-four hours after the&#10;first one.  I remember how I sat on the table there in the blackness,&#10;with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes.  I wished I&#10;had a light to smoke by, little suspecting the meaning of the minute&#10;gleam I had seen and all that it would presently bring me.  Ogilvy&#10;watched till one, and then gave it up; and we lit the lantern and&#10;walked over to his house.  Down below in the darkness were Ottershaw&#10;and Chertsey and all their hundreds of people, sleeping in peace.&#10;&#10;He was full of speculation that night about the condition of Mars,&#10;and scoffed at the vulgar idea of its having inhabitants who were&#10;signalling us.  His idea was that meteorites might be falling in a&#10;heavy shower upon the planet, or that a huge volcanic explosion was in&#10;progress.  He pointed out to me how unlikely it was that organic&#10;evolution had taken the same direction in the two adjacent planets.&#10;&#10;&quot;The chances against anything manlike on Mars are a million to&#10;one,&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;Hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after&#10;about midnight, and again the night after; and so for ten nights, a&#10;flame each night.  Why the shots ceased after the tenth no one on&#10;earth has attempted to explain.  It may be the gases of the firing&#10;caused the Martians inconvenience.  Dense clouds of smoke or dust,&#10;visible through a powerful telescope on earth as little grey,&#10;fluctuating patches, spread through the clearness of the planet's&#10;atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features.&#10;&#10;Even the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at last, and&#10;popular notes appeared here, there, and everywhere concerning the&#10;volcanoes upon Mars.  The seriocomic periodical _Punch_, I remember,&#10;made a happy use of it in the political cartoon.  And, all&#10;unsuspected, those missiles the Martians had fired at us drew&#10;earthward, rushing now at a pace of many miles a second through the&#10;empty gulf of space, hour by hour and day by day, nearer and nearer.&#10;It seems to me now almost incredibly wonderful that, with that swift&#10;fate hanging over us, men could go about their petty concerns as they&#10;did.  I remember how jubilant Markham was at securing a new photograph&#10;of the planet for the illustrated paper he edited in those days.&#10;People in these latter times scarcely realise the abundance and&#10;enterprise of our nineteenth-century papers.  For my own part, I was&#10;much occupied in learning to ride the bicycle, and busy upon a series&#10;of papers discussing the probable developments of moral ideas as&#10;civilisation progressed.&#10;&#10;One night (the first missile then could scarcely have been&#10;10,000,000 miles away) I went for a walk with my wife.  It was&#10;starlight and I explained the Signs of the Zodiac to her, and pointed&#10;out Mars, a bright dot of light creeping zenithward, towards which so&#10;many telescopes were pointed.  It was a warm night.  Coming home, a&#10;party of excursionists from Chertsey or Isleworth passed us singing&#10;and playing music.  There were lights in the upper windows of the&#10;houses as the people went to bed.  From the railway station in the&#10;distance came the sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling,&#10;softened almost into melody by the distance.  My wife pointed out to&#10;me the brightness of the red, green, and yellow signal lights hanging&#10;in a framework against the sky.  It seemed so safe and tranquil.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER TWO&#10;&#10;THE FALLING STAR&#10;&#10;&#10;Then came the night of the first falling star.  It was seen early&#10;in the morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame high&#10;in the atmosphere.  Hundreds must have seen it, and taken it for an&#10;ordinary falling star.  Albin described it as leaving a greenish&#10;streak behind it that glowed for some seconds.  Denning, our greatest&#10;authority on meteorites, stated that the height of its first&#10;appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles.  It seemed to him&#10;that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him.&#10;&#10;I was at home at that hour and writing in my study; and although my&#10;French windows face towards Ottershaw and the blind was up (for I&#10;loved in those days to look up at the night sky), I saw nothing of it.&#10;Yet this strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer&#10;space must have fallen while I was sitting there, visible to me had I&#10;only looked up as it passed.  Some of those who saw its flight say it&#10;travelled with a hissing sound.  I myself heard nothing of that.  Many&#10;people in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the fall of&#10;it, and, at most, have thought that another meteorite had descended.&#10;No one seems to have troubled to look for the fallen mass that night.&#10;&#10;But very early in the morning poor Ogilvy, who had seen the&#10;shooting star and who was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere on&#10;the common between Horsell, Ottershaw, and Woking, rose early with the&#10;idea of finding it.  Find it he did, soon after dawn, and not far from&#10;the sand pits.  An enormous hole had been made by the impact of the&#10;projectile, and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every&#10;direction over the heath, forming heaps visible a mile and a half&#10;away.  The heather was on fire eastward, and a thin blue smoke rose&#10;against the dawn.&#10;&#10;The Thing itself lay almost entirely buried in sand, amidst the&#10;scattered splinters of a fir tree it had shivered to fragments in its&#10;descent.  The uncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder,&#10;caked over and its outline softened by a thick scaly dun-coloured&#10;incrustation.  It had a diameter of about thirty yards.  He approached&#10;the mass, surprised at the size and more so at the shape, since most&#10;meteorites are rounded more or less completely.  It was, however,&#10;still so hot from its flight through the air as to forbid his near&#10;approach.  A stirring noise within its cylinder he ascribed to the&#10;unequal cooling of its surface; for at that time it had not occurred&#10;to him that it might be hollow.&#10;&#10;He remained standing at the edge of the pit that the Thing had made&#10;for itself, staring at its strange appearance, astonished chiefly at&#10;its unusual shape and colour, and dimly perceiving even then some&#10;evidence of design in its arrival.  The early morning was wonderfully&#10;still, and the sun, just clearing the pine trees towards Weybridge,&#10;was already warm.  He did not remember hearing any birds that morning,&#10;there was certainly no breeze stirring, and the only sounds were the&#10;faint movements from within the cindery cylinder.  He was all alone on&#10;the common.&#10;&#10;Then suddenly he noticed with a start that some of the grey&#10;clinker, the ashy incrustation that covered the meteorite, was falling&#10;off the circular edge of the end.  It was dropping off in flakes and&#10;raining down upon the sand.  A large piece suddenly came off and fell&#10;with a sharp noise that brought his heart into his mouth.&#10;&#10;For a minute he scarcely realised what this meant, and, although&#10;the heat was excessive, he clambered down into the pit close to the&#10;bulk to see the Thing more clearly.  He fancied even then that the&#10;cooling of the body might account for this, but what disturbed that&#10;idea was the fact that the ash was falling only from the end of the&#10;cylinder.&#10;&#10;And then he perceived that, very slowly, the circular top of the&#10;cylinder was rotating on its body.  It was such a gradual movement&#10;that he discovered it only through noticing that a black mark that had&#10;been near him five minutes ago was now at the other side of the&#10;circumference.  Even then he scarcely understood what this indicated,&#10;until he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk&#10;forward an inch or so.  Then the thing came upon him in a flash.  The&#10;cylinder was artificial--hollow--with an end that screwed out!&#10;Something within the cylinder was unscrewing the top!&#10;&#10;&quot;Good heavens!&quot; said Ogilvy.  &quot;There's a man in it--men in it! Half&#10;roasted to death!  Trying to escape!&quot;&#10;&#10;At once, with a quick mental leap, he linked the Thing with the&#10;flash upon Mars.&#10;&#10;The thought of the confined creature was so dreadful to him that he&#10;forgot the heat and went forward to the cylinder to help turn.  But&#10;luckily the dull radiation arrested him before he could burn his hands&#10;on the still-glowing metal.  At that he stood irresolute for a moment,&#10;then turned, scrambled out of the pit, and set off running wildly into&#10;Woking.  The time then must have been somewhere about six o'clock.&#10;He met a waggoner and tried to make him understand, but the tale he&#10;told and his appearance were so wild--his hat had fallen off in the&#10;pit--that the man simply drove on.  He was equally unsuccessful with the&#10;potman who was just unlocking the doors of the public-house by Horsell&#10;Bridge.  The fellow thought he was a lunatic at large and made an&#10;unsuccessful attempt to shut him into the taproom.  That sobered him a&#10;little; and when he saw Henderson, the London journalist, in his&#10;garden, he called over the palings and made himself understood.&#10;&#10;&quot;Henderson,&quot; he called, &quot;you saw that shooting star last night?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well?&quot; said Henderson.&#10;&#10;&quot;It's out on Horsell Common now.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Good Lord!&quot; said Henderson.  &quot;Fallen meteorite!  That's good.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But it's something more than a meteorite.  It's a cylinder--an&#10;artificial cylinder, man!  And there's something inside.&quot;&#10;&#10;Henderson stood up with his spade in his hand.&#10;&#10;&quot;What's that?&quot; he said.  He was deaf in one ear.&#10;&#10;Ogilvy told him all that he had seen.  Henderson was a minute or so&#10;taking it in.  Then he dropped his spade, snatched up his jacket, and&#10;came out into the road.  The two men hurried back at once to the&#10;common, and found the cylinder still lying in the same position.  But&#10;now the sounds inside had ceased, and a thin circle of bright metal&#10;showed between the top and the body of the cylinder.  Air was either&#10;entering or escaping at the rim with a thin, sizzling sound.&#10;&#10;They listened, rapped on the scaly burnt metal with a stick, and,&#10;meeting with no response, they both concluded the man or men inside&#10;must be insensible or dead.&#10;&#10;Of course the two were quite unable to do anything.  They shouted&#10;consolation and promises, and went off back to the town again to get&#10;help.  One can imagine them, covered with sand, excited and&#10;disordered, running up the little street in the bright sunlight just&#10;as the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were&#10;opening their bedroom windows.  Henderson went into the railway&#10;station at once, in order to telegraph the news to London.  The&#10;newspaper articles had prepared men's minds for the reception of the&#10;idea.&#10;&#10;By eight o'clock a number of boys and unemployed men had already&#10;started for the common to see the &quot;dead men from Mars.&quot;  That was the&#10;form the story took.  I heard of it first from my newspaper boy about&#10;a quarter to nine when I went out to get my _Daily Chronicle_.  I was&#10;naturally startled, and lost no time in going out and across the&#10;Ottershaw bridge to the sand pits.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER THREE&#10;&#10;ON HORSELL COMMON&#10;&#10;&#10;I found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people surrounding the&#10;huge hole in which the cylinder lay.  I have already described the&#10;appearance of that colossal bulk, embedded in the ground.  The turf&#10;and gravel about it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion.  No&#10;doubt its impact had caused a flash of fire.  Henderson and Ogilvy&#10;were not there.  I think they perceived that nothing was to be done&#10;for the present, and had gone away to breakfast at Henderson's house.&#10;&#10;There were four or five boys sitting on the edge of the Pit, with&#10;their feet dangling, and amusing themselves--until I stopped them--by&#10;throwing stones at the giant mass.  After I had spoken to them about&#10;it, they began playing at &quot;touch&quot; in and out of the group of&#10;bystanders.&#10;&#10;Among these were a couple of cyclists, a jobbing gardener I&#10;employed sometimes, a girl carrying a baby, Gregg the butcher and his&#10;little boy, and two or three loafers and golf caddies who were&#10;accustomed to hang about the railway station.  There was very little&#10;talking.  Few of the common people in England had anything but the&#10;vaguest astronomical ideas in those days.  Most of them were staring&#10;quietly at the big table like end of the cylinder, which was still as&#10;Ogilvy and Henderson had left it.  I fancy the popular expectation of&#10;a heap of charred corpses was disappointed at this inanimate bulk.&#10;Some went away while I was there, and other people came.  I clambered&#10;into the pit and fancied I heard a faint movement under my feet.  The&#10;top had certainly ceased to rotate.&#10;&#10;It was only when I got thus close to it that the strangeness of&#10;this object was at all evident to me.  At the first glance it was&#10;really no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown&#10;across the road.  Not so much so, indeed.  It looked like a rusty gas&#10;float.  It required a certain amount of scientific education to&#10;perceive that the grey scale of the Thing was no common oxide, that&#10;the yellowish-white metal that gleamed in the crack between the lid&#10;and the cylinder had an unfamiliar hue.  &quot;Extra-terrestrial&quot; had no&#10;meaning for most of the onlookers.&#10;&#10;At that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the Thing had&#10;come from the planet Mars, but I judged it improbable that it&#10;contained any living creature.  I thought the unscrewing might be&#10;automatic.  In spite of Ogilvy, I still believed that there were men&#10;in Mars.  My mind ran fancifully on the possibilities of its&#10;containing manuscript, on the difficulties in translation that might&#10;arise, whether we should find coins and models in it, and so forth.&#10;Yet it was a little too large for assurance on this idea.  I felt an&#10;impatience to see it opened.  About eleven, as nothing seemed&#10;happening, I walked back, full of such thought, to my home in Maybury.&#10;But I found it difficult to get to work upon my abstract&#10;investigations.&#10;&#10;In the afternoon the appearance of the common had altered very&#10;much.  The early editions of the evening papers had startled London&#10;with enormous headlines:&#10;&#10;  &quot;A MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM MARS.&quot;&#10;&#10;  &quot;REMARKABLE STORY FROM WOKING,&quot;&#10;&#10;and so forth.  In addition, Ogilvy's wire to the Astronomical Exchange&#10;had roused every observatory in the three kingdoms.&#10;&#10;There were half a dozen flies or more from the Woking station&#10;standing in the road by the sand pits, a basket-chaise from Chobham,&#10;and a rather lordly carriage.  Besides that, there was quite a heap of&#10;bicycles.  In addition, a large number of people must have walked, in&#10;spite of the heat of the day, from Woking and Chertsey, so that there&#10;was altogether quite a considerable crowd--one or two gaily dressed&#10;ladies among the others.&#10;&#10;It was glaringly hot, not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind,&#10;and the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees.  The&#10;burning heather had been extinguished, but the level ground towards&#10;Ottershaw was blackened as far as one could see, and still giving off&#10;vertical streamers of smoke.  An enterprising sweet-stuff dealer in&#10;the Chobham Road had sent up his son with a barrow-load of green&#10;apples and ginger beer.&#10;&#10;Going to the edge of the pit, I found it occupied by a group of&#10;about half a dozen men--Henderson, Ogilvy, and a tall, fair-haired man&#10;that I afterwards learned was Stent, the Astronomer Royal, with&#10;several workmen wielding spades and pickaxes.  Stent was giving&#10;directions in a clear, high-pitched voice.  He was standing on the&#10;cylinder, which was now evidently much cooler; his face was crimson&#10;and streaming with perspiration, and something seemed to have&#10;irritated him.&#10;&#10;A large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered, though its&#10;lower end was still embedded.  As soon as Ogilvy saw me among the&#10;staring crowd on the edge of the pit he called to me to come down, and&#10;asked me if I would mind going over to see Lord Hilton, the lord of&#10;the manor.&#10;&#10;The growing crowd, he said, was becoming a serious impediment to&#10;their excavations, especially the boys.  They wanted a light railing&#10;put up, and help to keep the people back.  He told me that a faint&#10;stirring was occasionally still audible within the case, but that the&#10;workmen had failed to unscrew the top, as it afforded no grip to them.&#10;The case appeared to be enormously thick, and it was possible that the&#10;faint sounds we heard represented a noisy tumult in the interior.&#10;&#10;I was very glad to do as he asked, and so become one of the&#10;privileged spectators within the contemplated enclosure.  I failed to&#10;find Lord Hilton at his house, but I was told he was expected from&#10;London by the six o'clock train from Waterloo; and as it was then&#10;about a quarter past five, I went home, had some tea, and walked up to&#10;the station to waylay him.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER FOUR&#10;&#10;THE CYLINDER OPENS&#10;&#10;&#10;When I returned to the common the sun was setting.  Scattered groups&#10;were hurrying from the direction of Woking, and one or two persons&#10;were returning.  The crowd about the pit had increased, and stood out&#10;black against the lemon yellow of the sky--a couple of hundred people,&#10;perhaps.  There were raised voices, and some sort of struggle appeared&#10;to be going on about the pit.  Strange imaginings passed through my&#10;mind.  As I drew nearer I heard Stent's voice:&#10;&#10;&quot;Keep back!  Keep back!&quot;&#10;&#10;A boy came running towards me.&#10;&#10;&quot;It's a-movin',&quot; he said to me as he passed; &quot;a-screwin' and&#10;a-screwin' out.  I don't like it.  I'm a-goin' 'ome, I am.&quot;&#10;&#10;I went on to the crowd.  There were really, I should think, two or&#10;three hundred people elbowing and jostling one another, the one or two&#10;ladies there being by no means the least active.&#10;&#10;&quot;He's fallen in the pit!&quot; cried some one.&#10;&#10;&quot;Keep back!&quot; said several.&#10;&#10;The crowd swayed a little, and I elbowed my way through.  Every one&#10;seemed greatly excited.  I heard a peculiar humming sound from the&#10;pit.&#10;&#10;&quot;I say!&quot; said Ogilvy; &quot;help keep these idiots back.  We don't know&#10;what's in the confounded thing, you know!&quot;&#10;&#10;I saw a young man, a shop assistant in Woking I believe he was,&#10;standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again.&#10;The crowd had pushed him in.&#10;&#10;The end of the cylinder was being screwed out from within.  Nearly&#10;two feet of shining screw projected.  Somebody blundered against me,&#10;and I narrowly missed being pitched onto the top of the screw.  I&#10;turned, and as I did so the screw must have come out, for the lid of&#10;the cylinder fell upon the gravel with a ringing concussion.  I stuck&#10;my elbow into the person behind me, and turned my head towards the&#10;Thing again.  For a moment that circular cavity seemed perfectly black.&#10;I had the sunset in my eyes.&#10;&#10;I think everyone expected to see a man emerge--possibly something a&#10;little unlike us terrestrial men, but in all essentials a man.  I know&#10;I did.  But, looking, I presently saw something stirring within the&#10;shadow: greyish billowy movements, one above another, and then two&#10;luminous disks--like eyes.  Then something resembling a little grey&#10;snake, about the thickness of a walking stick, coiled up out of the&#10;writhing middle, and wriggled in the air towards me--and then another.&#10;&#10;A sudden chill came over me.  There was a loud shriek from a woman&#10;behind.  I half turned, keeping my eyes fixed upon the cylinder still,&#10;from which other tentacles were now projecting, and began pushing my&#10;way back from the edge of the pit.  I saw astonishment giving place to&#10;horror on the faces of the people about me.  I heard inarticulate&#10;exclamations on all sides.  There was a general movement backwards.&#10;I saw the shopman struggling still on the edge of the pit.  I found&#10;myself alone, and saw the people on the other side of the pit running&#10;off, Stent among them.  I looked again at the cylinder, and&#10;ungovernable terror gripped me.  I stood petrified and staring.&#10;&#10;A big greyish rounded bulk, the size, perhaps, of a bear, was&#10;rising slowly and painfully out of the cylinder.  As it bulged up and&#10;caught the light, it glistened like wet leather.&#10;&#10;Two large dark-coloured eyes were regarding me steadfastly.  The&#10;mass that framed them, the head of the thing, was rounded, and had,&#10;one might say, a face.  There was a mouth under the eyes, the lipless&#10;brim of which quivered and panted, and dropped saliva.  The whole&#10;creature heaved and pulsated convulsively.  A lank tentacular&#10;appendage gripped the edge of the cylinder, another swayed in the air.&#10;&#10;Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imagine the&#10;strange horror of its appearance.  The peculiar V-shaped mouth with&#10;its pointed upper lip, the absence of brow ridges, the absence of a&#10;chin beneath the wedgelike lower lip, the incessant quivering of this&#10;mouth, the Gorgon groups of tentacles, the tumultuous breathing of the&#10;lungs in a strange atmosphere, the evident heaviness and painfulness&#10;of movement due to the greater gravitational energy of the earth--above&#10;all, the extraordinary intensity of the immense eyes--were at&#10;once vital, intense, inhuman, crippled and monstrous.  There was&#10;something fungoid in the oily brown skin, something in the clumsy&#10;deliberation of the tedious movements unspeakably nasty.  Even at this&#10;first encounter, this first glimpse, I was overcome with disgust and&#10;dread.&#10;&#10;Suddenly the monster vanished.  It had toppled over the brim of the&#10;cylinder and fallen into the pit, with a thud like the fall of a great&#10;mass of leather.  I heard it give a peculiar thick cry, and forthwith&#10;another of these creatures appeared darkly in the deep shadow of the&#10;aperture.&#10;&#10;I turned and, running madly, made for the first group of trees,&#10;perhaps a hundred yards away; but I ran slantingly and stumbling, for&#10;I could not avert my face from these things.&#10;&#10;There, among some young pine trees and furze bushes, I stopped,&#10;panting, and waited further developments.  The common round the sand&#10;pits was dotted with people, standing like myself in a half-fascinated&#10;terror, staring at these creatures, or rather at the heaped gravel at&#10;the edge of the pit in which they lay.  And then, with a renewed&#10;horror, I saw a round, black object bobbing up and down on the edge of&#10;the pit.  It was the head of the shopman who had fallen in, but&#10;showing as a little black object against the hot western sun.  Now he&#10;got his shoulder and knee up, and again he seemed to slip back until&#10;only his head was visible.  Suddenly he vanished, and I could have&#10;fancied a faint shriek had reached me.  I had a momentary impulse to&#10;go back and help him that my fears overruled.&#10;&#10;Everything was then quite invisible, hidden by the deep pit and the&#10;heap of sand that the fall of the cylinder had made.  Anyone coming&#10;along the road from Chobham or Woking would have been amazed at the&#10;sight--a dwindling multitude of perhaps a hundred people or more&#10;standing in a great irregular circle, in ditches, behind bushes,&#10;behind gates and hedges, saying little to one another and that in&#10;short, excited shouts, and staring, staring hard at a few heaps of&#10;sand.  The barrow of ginger beer stood, a queer derelict, black&#10;against the burning sky, and in the sand pits was a row of deserted&#10;vehicles with their horses feeding out of nosebags or pawing the&#10;ground.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER FIVE&#10;&#10;THE HEAT-RAY&#10;&#10;&#10;After the glimpse I had had of the Martians emerging from the&#10;cylinder in which they had come to the earth from their planet, a kind&#10;of fascination paralysed my actions.  I remained standing knee-deep in&#10;the heather, staring at the mound that hid them.  I was a battleground&#10;of fear and curiosity.&#10;&#10;I did not dare to go back towards the pit, but I felt a passionate&#10;longing to peer into it.  I began walking, therefore, in a big curve,&#10;seeking some point of vantage and continually looking at the sand&#10;heaps that hid these new-comers to our earth.  Once a leash of thin&#10;black whips, like the arms of an octopus, flashed across the sunset&#10;and was immediately withdrawn, and afterwards a thin rod rose up,&#10;joint by joint, bearing at its apex a circular disk that spun with a&#10;wobbling motion.  What could be going on there?&#10;&#10;Most of the spectators had gathered in one or two groups--one a&#10;little crowd towards Woking, the other a knot of people in the&#10;direction of Chobham.  Evidently they shared my mental conflict.&#10;There were few near me.  One man I approached--he was, I perceived,&#10;a neighbour of mine, though I did not know his name--and accosted.&#10;But it was scarcely a time for articulate conversation.&#10;&#10;&quot;What ugly _brutes_!&quot; he said.  &quot;Good God!  What ugly brutes!&quot;  He&#10;repeated this over and over again.&#10;&#10;&quot;Did you see a man in the pit?&quot; I said; but he made no answer to&#10;that.  We became silent, and stood watching for a time side by side,&#10;deriving, I fancy, a certain comfort in one another's company.  Then I&#10;shifted my position to a little knoll that gave me the advantage of a&#10;yard or more of elevation and when I looked for him presently he was&#10;walking towards Woking.&#10;&#10;The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened.  The&#10;crowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I&#10;heard now a faint murmur from it.  The little knot of people towards&#10;Chobham dispersed.  There was scarcely an intimation of movement from&#10;the pit.&#10;&#10;It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I&#10;suppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore&#10;confidence.  At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent&#10;movement upon the sand pits began, a movement that seemed to gather&#10;force as the stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained&#10;unbroken.  Vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance,&#10;stop, watch, and advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin&#10;irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated&#10;horns.  I, too, on my side began to move towards the pit.&#10;&#10;Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand&#10;pits, and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels.  I saw a&#10;lad trundling off the barrow of apples.  And then, within thirty yards&#10;of the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little&#10;black knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.&#10;&#10;This was the Deputation.  There had been a hasty consultation, and&#10;since the Martians were evidently, in spite of their repulsive forms,&#10;intelligent creatures, it had been resolved to show them, by&#10;approaching them with signals, that we too were intelligent.&#10;&#10;Flutter, flutter, went the flag, first to the right, then to the&#10;left.  It was too far for me to recognise anyone there, but afterwards&#10;I learned that Ogilvy, Stent, and Henderson were with others in this&#10;attempt at communication.  This little group had in its advance&#10;dragged inward, so to speak, the circumference of the now almost&#10;complete circle of people, and a number of dim black figures followed&#10;it at discreet distances.&#10;&#10;Suddenly there was a flash of light, and a quantity of luminous&#10;greenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs, which&#10;drove up, one after the other, straight into the still air.&#10;&#10;This smoke (or flame, perhaps, would be the better word for it) was&#10;so bright that the deep blue sky overhead and the hazy stretches of&#10;brown common towards Chertsey, set with black pine trees, seemed to&#10;darken abruptly as these puffs arose, and to remain the darker after&#10;their dispersal.  At the same time a faint hissing sound became&#10;audible.&#10;&#10;Beyond the pit stood the little wedge of people with the white flag&#10;at its apex, arrested by these phenomena, a little knot of small&#10;vertical black shapes upon the black ground.  As the green smoke arose,&#10;their faces flashed out pallid green, and faded again as it vanished.&#10;Then slowly the hissing passed into a humming, into a long, loud,&#10;droning noise.  Slowly a humped shape rose out of the pit, and the&#10;ghost of a beam of light seemed to flicker out from it.&#10;&#10;Forthwith flashes of actual flame, a bright glare leaping from one&#10;to another, sprang from the scattered group of men.  It was as if some&#10;invisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into white flame.  It was&#10;as if each man were suddenly and momentarily turned to fire.&#10;&#10;Then, by the light of their own destruction, I saw them staggering&#10;and falling, and their supporters turning to run.&#10;&#10;I stood staring, not as yet realising that this was death leaping&#10;from man to man in that little distant crowd.  All I felt was that it&#10;was something very strange.  An almost noiseless and blinding flash of&#10;light, and a man fell headlong and lay still; and as the unseen shaft&#10;of heat passed over them, pine trees burst into fire, and every dry&#10;furze bush became with one dull thud a mass of flames.  And far away&#10;towards Knaphill I saw the flashes of trees and hedges and wooden&#10;buildings suddenly set alight.&#10;&#10;It was sweeping round swiftly and steadily, this flaming death,&#10;this invisible, inevitable sword of heat.  I perceived it coming&#10;towards me by the flashing bushes it touched, and was too astounded&#10;and stupefied to stir.  I heard the crackle of fire in the sand pits&#10;and the sudden squeal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled.  Then&#10;it was as if an invisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn&#10;through the heather between me and the Martians, and all along a&#10;curving line beyond the sand pits the dark ground smoked and crackled.&#10;Something fell with a crash far away to the left where the road from&#10;Woking station opens out on the common.  Forth-with the hissing and&#10;humming ceased, and the black, dome-like object sank slowly out of&#10;sight into the pit.&#10;&#10;All this had happened with such swiftness that I had stood&#10;motionless, dumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes of light.  Had that&#10;death swept through a full circle, it must inevitably have slain me in&#10;my surprise.  But it passed and spared me, and left the night about me&#10;suddenly dark and unfamiliar.&#10;&#10;The undulating common seemed now dark almost to blackness, except&#10;where its roadways lay grey and pale under the deep blue sky of the&#10;early night.  It was dark, and suddenly void of men.  Overhead the&#10;stars were mustering, and in the west the sky was still a pale,&#10;bright, almost greenish blue.  The tops of the pine trees and the&#10;roofs of Horsell came out sharp and black against the western&#10;afterglow.  The Martians and their appliances were altogether&#10;invisible, save for that thin mast upon which their restless mirror&#10;wobbled.  Patches of bush and isolated trees here and there smoked and&#10;glowed still, and the houses towards Woking station were sending up&#10;spires of flame into the stillness of the evening air.&#10;&#10;Nothing was changed save for that and a terrible astonishment.  The&#10;little group of black specks with the flag of white had been swept out&#10;of existence, and the stillness of the evening, so it seemed to me,&#10;had scarcely been broken.&#10;&#10;It came to me that I was upon this dark common, helpless,&#10;unprotected, and alone.  Suddenly, like a thing falling upon me from&#10;without, came--fear.&#10;&#10;With an effort I turned and began a stumbling run through the&#10;heather.&#10;&#10;The fear I felt was no rational fear, but a panic terror not only&#10;of the Martians, but of the dusk and stillness all about me.  Such an&#10;extraordinary effect in unmanning me it had that I ran weeping&#10;silently as a child might do.  Once I had turned, I did not dare to&#10;look back.&#10;&#10;I remember I felt an extraordinary persuasion that I was being&#10;played with, that presently, when I was upon the very verge of safety,&#10;this mysterious death--as swift as the passage of light--would leap&#10;after me from the pit about the cylinder and strike me down.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER SIX&#10;&#10;THE HEAT-RAY IN THE CHOBHAM ROAD&#10;&#10;&#10;It is still a matter of wonder how the Martians are able to slay&#10;men so swiftly and so silently.  Many think that in some way they are&#10;able to generate an intense heat in a chamber of practically absolute&#10;non-conductivity.  This intense heat they project in a parallel beam&#10;against any object they choose, by means of a polished parabolic&#10;mirror of unknown composition, much as the parabolic mirror of a&#10;lighthouse projects a beam of light.  But no one has absolutely proved&#10;these details.  However it is done, it is certain that a beam of heat&#10;is the essence of the matter.  Heat, and invisible, instead of&#10;visible, light.  Whatever is combustible flashes into flame at its&#10;touch, lead runs like water, it softens iron, cracks and melts glass,&#10;and when it falls upon water, incontinently that explodes into steam.&#10;&#10;That night nearly forty people lay under the starlight about the&#10;pit, charred and distorted beyond recognition, and all night long the&#10;common from Horsell to Maybury was deserted and brightly ablaze.&#10;&#10;The news of the massacre probably reached Chobham, Woking, and&#10;Ottershaw about the same time.  In Woking the shops had closed when&#10;the tragedy happened, and a number of people, shop people and so&#10;forth, attracted by the stories they had heard, were walking over the&#10;Horsell Bridge and along the road between the hedges that runs out at&#10;last upon the common.  You may imagine the young people brushed up&#10;after the labours of the day, and making this novelty, as they would&#10;make any novelty, the excuse for walking together and enjoying a&#10;trivial flirtation.  You may figure to yourself the hum of voices&#10;along the road in the gloaming. . . .&#10;&#10;As yet, of course, few people in Woking even knew that the cylinder&#10;had opened, though poor Henderson had sent a messenger on a bicycle to&#10;the post office with a special wire to an evening paper.&#10;&#10;As these folks came out by twos and threes upon the open, they&#10;found little knots of people talking excitedly and peering at the&#10;spinning mirror over the sand pits, and the newcomers were, no doubt,&#10;soon infected by the excitement of the occasion.&#10;&#10;By half past eight, when the Deputation was destroyed, there may&#10;have been a crowd of three hundred people or more at this place,&#10;besides those who had left the road to approach the Martians nearer.&#10;There were three policemen too, one of whom was mounted, doing their&#10;best, under instructions from Stent, to keep the people back and deter&#10;them from approaching the cylinder.  There was some booing from those&#10;more thoughtless and excitable souls to whom a crowd is always an&#10;occasion for noise and horse-play.&#10;&#10;Stent and Ogilvy, anticipating some possibilities of a collision,&#10;had telegraphed from Horsell to the barracks as soon as the Martians&#10;emerged, for the help of a company of soldiers to protect these&#10;strange creatures from violence.  After that they returned to lead that&#10;ill-fated advance.  The description of their death, as it was seen by&#10;the crowd, tallies very closely with my own impressions: the three&#10;puffs of green smoke, the deep humming note, and the flashes of flame.&#10;&#10;But that crowd of people had a far narrower escape than mine.  Only&#10;the fact that a hummock of heathery sand intercepted the lower part of&#10;the Heat-Ray saved them.  Had the elevation of the parabolic mirror&#10;been a few yards higher, none could have lived to tell the tale.  They&#10;saw the flashes and the men falling and an invisible hand, as it were,&#10;lit the bushes as it hurried towards them through the twilight.  Then,&#10;with a whistling note that rose above the droning of the pit, the beam&#10;swung close over their heads, lighting the tops of the beech trees&#10;that line the road, and splitting the bricks, smashing the windows,&#10;firing the window frames, and bringing down in crumbling ruin a&#10;portion of the gable of the house nearest the corner.&#10;&#10;In the sudden thud, hiss, and glare of the igniting trees, the&#10;panic-stricken crowd seems to have swayed hesitatingly for some&#10;moments.  Sparks and burning twigs began to fall into the road, and&#10;single leaves like puffs of flame.  Hats and dresses caught fire.  Then&#10;came a crying from the common.  There were shrieks and shouts, and&#10;suddenly a mounted policeman came galloping through the confusion with&#10;his hands clasped over his head, screaming.&#10;&#10;&quot;They're coming!&quot; a woman shrieked, and incontinently everyone was&#10;turning and pushing at those behind, in order to clear their way to&#10;Woking again.  They must have bolted as blindly as a flock of sheep.&#10;Where the road grows narrow and black between the high banks the crowd&#10;jammed, and a desperate struggle occurred.  All that crowd did not&#10;escape; three persons at least, two women and a little boy, were&#10;crushed and trampled there, and left to die amid the terror and the&#10;darkness.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER SEVEN&#10;&#10;HOW I REACHED HOME&#10;&#10;&#10;For my own part, I remember nothing of my flight except the stress&#10;of blundering against trees and stumbling through the heather.  All&#10;about me gathered the invisible terrors of the Martians; that pitiless&#10;sword of heat seemed whirling to and fro, flourishing overhead before&#10;it descended and smote me out of life.  I came into the road between&#10;the crossroads and Horsell, and ran along this to the crossroads.&#10;&#10;At last I could go no further; I was exhausted with the violence of&#10;my emotion and of my flight, and I staggered and fell by the wayside.&#10;That was near the bridge that crosses the canal by the gasworks.  I&#10;fell and lay still.&#10;&#10;I must have remained there some time.&#10;&#10;I sat up, strangely perplexed.  For a moment, perhaps, I could not&#10;clearly understand how I came there.  My terror had fallen from me&#10;like a garment.  My hat had gone, and my collar had burst away from&#10;its fastener.  A few minutes before, there had only been three real&#10;things before me--the immensity of the night and space and nature, my&#10;own feebleness and anguish, and the near approach of death.  Now it&#10;was as if something turned over, and the point of view altered&#10;abruptly.  There was no sensible transition from one state of mind to&#10;the other.  I was immediately the self of every day again--a decent,&#10;ordinary citizen.  The silent common, the impulse of my flight, the&#10;starting flames, were as if they had been in a dream.  I asked myself&#10;had these latter things indeed happened?  I could not credit it.&#10;&#10;I rose and walked unsteadily up the steep incline of the bridge.  My&#10;mind was blank wonder.  My muscles and nerves seemed drained of their&#10;strength.  I dare say I staggered drunkenly.  A head rose over the&#10;arch, and the figure of a workman carrying a basket appeared.  Beside&#10;him ran a little boy.  He passed me, wishing me good night.  I was&#10;minded to speak to him, but did not.  I answered his greeting with a&#10;meaningless mumble and went on over the bridge.&#10;&#10;Over the Maybury arch a train, a billowing tumult of white, firelit&#10;smoke, and a long caterpillar of lighted windows, went flying&#10;south--clatter, clatter, clap, rap, and it had gone.  A dim group of&#10;people talked in the gate of one of the houses in the pretty little&#10;row of gables that was called Oriental Terrace.  It was all so real&#10;and so familiar.  And that behind me!  It was frantic, fantastic!&#10;Such things, I told myself, could not be.&#10;&#10;Perhaps I am a man of exceptional moods.  I do not know how far my&#10;experience is common.  At times I suffer from the strangest sense of&#10;detachment from myself and the world about me; I seem to watch it all&#10;from the outside, from somewhere inconceivably remote, out of time,&#10;out of space, out of the stress and tragedy of it all.  This feeling&#10;was very strong upon me that night.  Here was another side to my&#10;dream.&#10;&#10;But the trouble was the blank incongruity of this serenity and the&#10;swift death flying yonder, not two miles away.  There was a noise of&#10;business from the gasworks, and the electric lamps were all alight.  I&#10;stopped at the group of people.&#10;&#10;&quot;What news from the common?&quot; said I.&#10;&#10;There were two men and a woman at the gate.&#10;&#10;&quot;Eh?&quot; said one of the men, turning.&#10;&#10;&quot;What news from the common?&quot; I said.&#10;&#10;&quot;'Ain't yer just _been_ there?&quot; asked the men.&#10;&#10;&quot;People seem fair silly about the common,&quot; said the woman over the&#10;gate.  &quot;What's it all abart?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Haven't you heard of the men from Mars?&quot; said I; &quot;the creatures&#10;from Mars?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Quite enough,&quot; said the woman over the gate.  &quot;Thenks&quot;; and all&#10;three of them laughed.&#10;&#10;I felt foolish and angry.  I tried and found I could not tell them&#10;what I had seen.  They laughed again at my broken sentences.&#10;&#10;&quot;You'll hear more yet,&quot; I said, and went on to my home.&#10;&#10;I startled my wife at the doorway, so haggard was I.  I went into&#10;the dining room, sat down, drank some wine, and so soon as I could&#10;collect myself sufficiently I told her the things I had seen.  The&#10;dinner, which was a cold one, had already been served, and remained&#10;neglected on the table while I told my story.&#10;&#10;&quot;There is one thing,&quot; I said, to allay the fears I had aroused;&#10;&quot;they are the most sluggish things I ever saw crawl.  They may keep&#10;the pit and kill people who come near them, but they cannot get out&#10;of it. . . .  But the horror of them!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Don't, dear!&quot; said my wife, knitting her brows and putting her&#10;hand on mine.&#10;&#10;&quot;Poor Ogilvy!&quot; I said.  &quot;To think he may be lying dead there!&quot;&#10;&#10;My wife at least did not find my experience incredible.  When I saw&#10;how deadly white her face was, I ceased abruptly.&#10;&#10;&quot;They may come here,&quot; she said again and again.&#10;&#10;I pressed her to take wine, and tried to reassure her.&#10;&#10;&quot;They can scarcely move,&quot; I said.&#10;&#10;I began to comfort her and myself by repeating all that Ogilvy had&#10;told me of the impossibility of the Martians establishing themselves&#10;on the earth.  In particular I laid stress on the gravitational&#10;difficulty.  On the surface of the earth the force of gravity is three&#10;times what it is on the surface of Mars.  A Martian, therefore, would&#10;weigh three times more than on Mars, albeit his muscular strength&#10;would be the same.  His own body would be a cope of lead to him.  That,&#10;indeed, was the general opinion.  Both _The Times_ and the _Daily&#10;Telegraph_, for instance, insisted on it the next morning, and both&#10;overlooked, just as I did, two obvious modifying influences.&#10;&#10;The atmosphere of the earth, we now know, contains far more oxygen&#10;or far less argon (whichever way one likes to put it) than does Mars.&#10;The invigorating influences of this excess of oxygen upon the Martians&#10;indisputably did much to counterbalance the increased weight of their&#10;bodies.  And, in the second place, we all overlooked the fact that&#10;such mechanical intelligence as the Martian possessed was quite able&#10;to dispense with muscular exertion at a pinch.&#10;&#10;But I did not consider these points at the time, and so my&#10;reasoning was dead against the chances of the invaders.  With wine and&#10;food, the confidence of my own table, and the necessity of reassuring&#10;my wife, I grew by insensible degrees courageous and secure.&#10;&#10;&quot;They have done a foolish thing,&quot; said I, fingering my wineglass.&#10;&quot;They are dangerous because, no doubt, they are mad with terror.&#10;Perhaps they expected to find no living things--certainly no&#10;intelligent living things.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A shell in the pit&quot; said I, &quot;if the worst comes to the worst will&#10;kill them all.&quot;&#10;&#10;The intense excitement of the events had no doubt left my&#10;perceptive powers in a state of erethism.  I remember that dinner&#10;table with extraordinary vividness even now.  My dear wife's sweet&#10;anxious face peering at me from under the pink lamp shade, the white&#10;cloth with its silver and glass table furniture--for in those days&#10;even philosophical writers had many little luxuries--the crimson-purple&#10;wine in my glass, are photographically distinct.  At the end of&#10;it I sat, tempering nuts with a cigarette, regretting Ogilvy's&#10;rashness, and denouncing the shortsighted timidity of the Martians.&#10;&#10;So some respectable dodo in the Mauritius might have lorded it in&#10;his nest, and discussed the arrival of that shipful of pitiless&#10;sailors in want of animal food.  &quot;We will peck them to death tomorrow,&#10;my dear.&quot;&#10;&#10;I did not know it, but that was the last civilised dinner I was to&#10;eat for very many strange and terrible days.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER EIGHT&#10;&#10;FRIDAY NIGHT&#10;&#10;&#10;The most extraordinary thing to my mind, of all the strange and&#10;wonderful things that happened upon that Friday, was the dovetailing&#10;of the commonplace habits of our social order with the first&#10;beginnings of the series of events that was to topple that social&#10;order headlong.  If on Friday night you had taken a pair of compasses&#10;and drawn a circle with a radius of five miles round the Woking sand&#10;pits, I doubt if you would have had one human being outside it, unless&#10;it were some relation of Stent or of the three or four cyclists or&#10;London people lying dead on the common, whose emotions or habits were&#10;at all affected by the new-comers.  Many people had heard of the&#10;cylinder, of course, and talked about it in their leisure, but it&#10;certainly did not make the sensation that an ultimatum to Germany&#10;would have done.&#10;&#10;In London that night poor Henderson's telegram describing the&#10;gradual unscrewing of the shot was judged to be a canard, and his&#10;evening paper, after wiring for authentication from him and receiving&#10;no reply--the man was killed--decided not to print a special edition.&#10;&#10;Even within the five-mile circle the great majority of people were&#10;inert.  I have already described the behaviour of the men and women to&#10;whom I spoke.  All over the district people were dining and supping;&#10;working men were gardening after the labours of the day, children&#10;were being put to bed, young people were wandering through the lanes&#10;love-making, students sat over their books.&#10;&#10;Maybe there was a murmur in the village streets, a novel and&#10;dominant topic in the public-houses, and here and there a messenger,&#10;or even an eye-witness of the later occurrences, caused a whirl of&#10;excitement, a shouting, and a running to and fro; but for the most&#10;part the daily routine of working, eating, drinking, sleeping, went on&#10;as it had done for countless years--as though no planet Mars existed&#10;in the sky.  Even at Woking station and Horsell and Chobham that was&#10;the case.&#10;&#10;In Woking junction, until a late hour, trains were stopping and&#10;going on, others were shunting on the sidings, passengers were&#10;alighting and waiting, and everything was proceeding in the most&#10;ordinary way.  A boy from the town, trenching on Smith's monopoly, was&#10;selling papers with the afternoon's news.  The ringing impact of&#10;trucks, the sharp whistle of the engines from the junction, mingled&#10;with their shouts of &quot;Men from Mars!&quot;  Excited men came into the&#10;station about nine o'clock with incredible tidings, and caused no more&#10;disturbance than drunkards might have done.  People rattling&#10;Londonwards peered into the darkness outside the carriage windows, and&#10;saw only a rare, flickering, vanishing spark dance up from the&#10;direction of Horsell, a red glow and a thin veil of smoke driving&#10;across the stars, and thought that nothing more serious than a heath&#10;fire was happening.  It was only round the edge of the common that any&#10;disturbance was perceptible.  There were half a dozen villas burning&#10;on the Woking border.  There were lights in all the houses on the&#10;common side of the three villages, and the people there kept awake&#10;till dawn.&#10;&#10;A curious crowd lingered restlessly, people coming and going but&#10;the crowd remaining, both on the Chobham and Horsell bridges.  One or&#10;two adventurous souls, it was afterwards found, went into the darkness&#10;and crawled quite near the Martians; but they never returned, for now&#10;and again a light-ray, like the beam of a warship's searchlight swept&#10;the common, and the Heat-Ray was ready to follow.  Save for such, that&#10;big area of common was silent and desolate, and the charred bodies lay&#10;about on it all night under the stars, and all the next day.  A noise&#10;of hammering from the pit was heard by many people.&#10;&#10;So you have the state of things on Friday night.  In the centre,&#10;sticking into the skin of our old planet Earth like a poisoned dart,&#10;was this cylinder.  But the poison was scarcely working yet.  Around&#10;it was a patch of silent common, smouldering in places, and with a few&#10;dark, dimly seen objects lying in contorted attitudes here and there.&#10;Here and there was a burning bush or tree.  Beyond was a fringe of&#10;excitement, and farther than that fringe the inflammation had not&#10;crept as yet.  In the rest of the world the stream of life still&#10;flowed as it had flowed for immemorial years.  The fever of war that&#10;would presently clog vein and artery, deaden nerve and destroy brain,&#10;had still to develop.&#10;&#10;All night long the Martians were hammering and stirring, sleepless,&#10;indefatigable, at work upon the machines they were making ready, and&#10;ever and again a puff of greenish-white smoke whirled up to the&#10;starlit sky.&#10;&#10;About eleven a company of soldiers came through Horsell, and&#10;deployed along the edge of the common to form a cordon.  Later a&#10;second company marched through Chobham to deploy on the north side of&#10;the common.  Several officers from the Inkerman barracks had been on&#10;the common earlier in the day, and one, Major Eden, was reported to be&#10;missing.  The colonel of the regiment came to the Chobham bridge and&#10;was busy questioning the crowd at midnight.  The military authorities&#10;were certainly alive to the seriousness of the business.  About&#10;eleven, the next morning's papers were able to say, a squadron of&#10;hussars, two Maxims, and about four hundred men of the Cardigan&#10;regiment started from Aldershot.&#10;&#10;A few seconds after midnight the crowd in the Chertsey road,&#10;Woking, saw a star fall from heaven into the pine woods to the&#10;northwest.  It had a greenish colour, and caused a silent brightness&#10;like summer lightning.  This was the second cylinder.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER NINE&#10;&#10;THE FIGHTING BEGINS&#10;&#10;&#10;Saturday lives in my memory as a day of suspense.  It was a day of&#10;lassitude too, hot and close, with, I am told, a rapidly fluctuating&#10;barometer.  I had slept but little, though my wife had succeeded in&#10;sleeping, and I rose early.  I went into my garden before breakfast&#10;and stood listening, but towards the common there was nothing stirring&#10;but a lark.&#10;&#10;The milkman came as usual.  I heard the rattle of his chariot and I&#10;went round to the side gate to ask the latest news.  He told me that&#10;during the night the Martians had been surrounded by troops, and that&#10;guns were expected.  Then--a familiar, reassuring note--I heard a train&#10;running towards Woking.&#10;&#10;&quot;They aren't to be killed,&quot; said the milkman, &quot;if that can possibly&#10;be avoided.&quot;&#10;&#10;I saw my neighbour gardening, chatted with him for a time, and then&#10;strolled in to breakfast.  It was a most unexceptional morning.  My&#10;neighbour was of opinion that the troops would be able to capture or&#10;to destroy the Martians during the day.&#10;&#10;&quot;It's a pity they make themselves so unapproachable,&quot; he said.  &quot;It&#10;would be curious to know how they live on another planet; we might&#10;learn a thing or two.&quot;&#10;&#10;He came up to the fence and extended a handful of strawberries, for&#10;his gardening was as generous as it was enthusiastic.  At the same&#10;time he told me of the burning of the pine woods about the Byfleet&#10;Golf Links.&#10;&#10;&quot;They say,&quot; said he, &quot;that there's another of those blessed things&#10;fallen there--number two.  But one's enough, surely.  This lot'll cost&#10;the insurance people a pretty penny before everything's settled.&quot;  He&#10;laughed with an air of the greatest good humour as he said this.  The&#10;woods, he said, were still burning, and pointed out a haze of smoke to&#10;me.  &quot;They will be hot under foot for days, on account of the thick&#10;soil of pine needles and turf,&quot; he said, and then grew serious over&#10;&quot;poor Ogilvy.&quot;&#10;&#10;After breakfast, instead of working, I decided to walk down&#10;towards the common.  Under the railway bridge I found a group of&#10;soldiers--sappers, I think, men in small round caps, dirty red jackets&#10;unbuttoned, and showing their blue shirts, dark trousers, and boots&#10;coming to the calf.  They told me no one was allowed over the canal,&#10;and, looking along the road towards the bridge, I saw one of the&#10;Cardigan men standing sentinel there.  I talked with these soldiers&#10;for a time; I told them of my sight of the Martians on the previous&#10;evening.  None of them had seen the Martians, and they had but the&#10;vaguest ideas of them, so that they plied me with questions.  They&#10;said that they did not know who had authorised the movements of the&#10;troops; their idea was that a dispute had arisen at the Horse Guards.&#10;The ordinary sapper is a great deal better educated than the common&#10;soldier, and they discussed the peculiar conditions of the possible&#10;fight with some acuteness.  I described the Heat-Ray to them, and they&#10;began to argue among themselves.&#10;&#10;&quot;Crawl up under cover and rush 'em, say I,&quot; said one.&#10;&#10;&quot;Get aht!&quot; said another.  &quot;What's cover against this 'ere 'eat?&#10;Sticks to cook yer!  What we got to do is to go as near as the&#10;ground'll let us, and then drive a trench.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Blow yer trenches!  You always want trenches; you ought to ha'&#10;been born a rabbit Snippy.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ain't they got any necks, then?&quot; said a third, abruptly--a little,&#10;contemplative, dark man, smoking a pipe.&#10;&#10;I repeated my description.&#10;&#10;&quot;Octopuses,&quot; said he, &quot;that's what I calls 'em.  Talk about fishers&#10;of men--fighters of fish it is this time!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It ain't no murder killing beasts like that,&quot; said the first&#10;speaker.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why not shell the darned things strite off and finish 'em?&quot; said&#10;the little dark man.  &quot;You carn tell what they might do.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Where's your shells?&quot; said the first speaker.  &quot;There ain't no&#10;time.  Do it in a rush, that's my tip, and do it at once.&quot;&#10;&#10;So they discussed it.  After a while I left them, and went on to&#10;the railway station to get as many morning papers as I could.&#10;&#10;But I will not weary the reader with a description of that long&#10;morning and of the longer afternoon.  I did not succeed in getting a&#10;glimpse of the common, for even Horsell and Chobham church towers were&#10;in the hands of the military authorities.  The soldiers I addressed&#10;didn't know anything; the officers were mysterious as well as busy.  I&#10;found people in the town quite secure again in the presence of the&#10;military, and I heard for the first time from Marshall, the&#10;tobacconist, that his son was among the dead on the common.  The&#10;soldiers had made the people on the outskirts of Horsell lock up and&#10;leave their houses.&#10;&#10;I got back to lunch about two, very tired for, as I have said, the&#10;day was extremely hot and dull; and in order to refresh myself I took&#10;a cold bath in the afternoon.  About half past four I went up to the&#10;railway station to get an evening paper, for the morning papers had&#10;contained only a very inaccurate description of the killing of Stent,&#10;Henderson, Ogilvy, and the others.  But there was little I didn't&#10;know.  The Martians did not show an inch of themselves.  They seemed&#10;busy in their pit, and there was a sound of hammering and an almost&#10;continuous streamer of smoke.  Apparently they were busy getting ready&#10;for a struggle.  &quot;Fresh attempts have been made to signal, but without&#10;success,&quot; was the stereotyped formula of the papers.  A sapper told me&#10;it was done by a man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole.  The&#10;Martians took as much notice of such advances as we should of the&#10;lowing of a cow.&#10;&#10;I must confess the sight of all this armament, all this&#10;preparation, greatly excited me.  My imagination became belligerent,&#10;and defeated the invaders in a dozen striking ways; something of my&#10;schoolboy dreams of battle and heroism came back.  It hardly seemed a&#10;fair fight to me at that time.  They seemed very helpless in that pit&#10;of theirs.&#10;&#10;About three o'clock there began the thud of a gun at measured&#10;intervals from Chertsey or Addlestone.  I learned that the smouldering&#10;pine wood into which the second cylinder had fallen was being shelled,&#10;in the hope of destroying that object before it opened.  It was only&#10;about five, however, that a field gun reached Chobham for use against&#10;the first body of Martians.&#10;&#10;About six in the evening, as I sat at tea with my wife in the&#10;summerhouse talking vigorously about the battle that was lowering upon&#10;us, I heard a muffled detonation from the common, and immediately&#10;after a gust of firing.  Close on the heels of that came a violent&#10;rattling crash, quite close to us, that shook the ground; and,&#10;starting out upon the lawn, I saw the tops of the trees about the&#10;Oriental College burst into smoky red flame, and the tower of the&#10;little church beside it slide down into ruin.  The pinnacle of the&#10;mosque had vanished, and the roof line of the college itself looked as&#10;if a hundred-ton gun had been at work upon it.  One of our chimneys&#10;cracked as if a shot had hit it, flew, and a piece of it came&#10;clattering down the tiles and made a heap of broken red fragments upon&#10;the flower bed by my study window.&#10;&#10;I and my wife stood amazed.  Then I realised that the crest of&#10;Maybury Hill must be within range of the Martians' Heat-Ray now that&#10;the college was cleared out of the way.&#10;&#10;At that I gripped my wife's arm, and without ceremony ran her out&#10;into the road.  Then I fetched out the servant, telling her I would go&#10;upstairs myself for the box she was clamouring for.&#10;&#10;&quot;We can't possibly stay here,&quot; I said; and as I spoke the firing&#10;reopened for a moment upon the common.&#10;&#10;&quot;But where are we to go?&quot; said my wife in terror.&#10;&#10;I thought perplexed.  Then I remembered her cousins at Leatherhead.&#10;&#10;&quot;Leatherhead!&quot; I shouted above the sudden noise.&#10;&#10;She looked away from me downhill.  The people were coming out of&#10;their houses, astonished.&#10;&#10;&quot;How are we to get to Leatherhead?&quot; she said.&#10;&#10;Down the hill I saw a bevy of hussars ride under the railway&#10;bridge; three galloped through the open gates of the Oriental College;&#10;two others dismounted, and began running from house to house.  The&#10;sun, shining through the smoke that drove up from the tops of the&#10;trees, seemed blood red, and threw an unfamiliar lurid light upon&#10;everything.&#10;&#10;&quot;Stop here,&quot; said I; &quot;you are safe here&quot;; and I started off at once&#10;for the Spotted Dog, for I knew the landlord had a horse and dog cart.&#10;I ran, for I perceived that in a moment everyone upon this side of the&#10;hill would be moving.  I found him in his bar, quite unaware of what&#10;was going on behind his house.  A man stood with his back to me,&#10;talking to him.&#10;&#10;&quot;I must have a pound,&quot; said the landlord, &quot;and I've no one to drive&#10;it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I'll give you two,&quot; said I, over the stranger's shoulder.&#10;&#10;&quot;What for?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And I'll bring it back by midnight,&quot; I said.&#10;&#10;&quot;Lord!&quot; said the landlord; &quot;what's the hurry?  I'm selling my bit&#10;of a pig.  Two pounds, and you bring it back?  What's going on now?&quot;&#10;&#10;I explained hastily that I had to leave my home, and so secured the&#10;dog cart.  At the time it did not seem to me nearly so urgent that the&#10;landlord should leave his.  I took care to have the cart there and&#10;then, drove it off down the road, and, leaving it in charge of my wife&#10;and servant, rushed into my house and packed a few valuables, such&#10;plate as we had, and so forth.  The beech trees below the house were&#10;burning while I did this, and the palings up the road glowed red.&#10;While I was occupied in this way, one of the dismounted hussars came&#10;running up.  He was going from house to house, warning people to&#10;leave.  He was going on as I came out of my front door, lugging my&#10;treasures, done up in a tablecloth.  I shouted after him:&#10;&#10;&quot;What news?&quot;&#10;&#10;He turned, stared, bawled something about &quot;crawling out in a thing&#10;like a dish cover,&quot; and ran on to the gate of the house at the crest.&#10;A sudden whirl of black smoke driving across the road hid him for a&#10;moment.  I ran to my neighbour's door and rapped to satisfy myself of&#10;what I already knew, that his wife had gone to London with him and had&#10;locked up their house.  I went in again, according to my promise, to&#10;get my servant's box, lugged it out, clapped it beside her on the tail&#10;of the dog cart, and then caught the reins and jumped up into the&#10;driver's seat beside my wife.  In another moment we were clear of the&#10;smoke and noise, and spanking down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill&#10;towards Old Woking.&#10;&#10;In front was a quiet sunny landscape, a wheat field ahead on either&#10;side of the road, and the Maybury Inn with its swinging sign.  I saw&#10;the doctor's cart ahead of me.  At the bottom of the hill I turned my&#10;head to look at the hillside I was leaving.  Thick streamers of black&#10;smoke shot with threads of red fire were driving up into the still&#10;air, and throwing dark shadows upon the green treetops eastward.  The&#10;smoke already extended far away to the east and west--to the Byfleet&#10;pine woods eastward, and to Woking on the west.  The road was dotted&#10;with people running towards us.  And very faint now, but very distinct&#10;through the hot, quiet air, one heard the whirr of a machine-gun that&#10;was presently stilled, and an intermittent cracking of rifles.&#10;Apparently the Martians were setting fire to everything within range&#10;of their Heat-Ray.&#10;&#10;I am not an expert driver, and I had immediately to turn my&#10;attention to the horse.  When I looked back again the second hill had&#10;hidden the black smoke.  I slashed the horse with the whip, and gave&#10;him a loose rein until Woking and Send lay between us and that&#10;quivering tumult.  I overtook and passed the doctor between Woking and&#10;Send.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER TEN&#10;&#10;IN THE STORM&#10;&#10;&#10;Leatherhead is about twelve miles from Maybury Hill.  The scent of&#10;hay was in the air through the lush meadows beyond Pyrford, and the&#10;hedges on either side were sweet and gay with multitudes of dog-roses.&#10;The heavy firing that had broken out while we were driving down&#10;Maybury Hill ceased as abruptly as it began, leaving the evening very&#10;peaceful and still.  We got to Leatherhead without misadventure about&#10;nine o'clock, and the horse had an hour's rest while I took supper&#10;with my cousins and commended my wife to their care.&#10;&#10;My wife was curiously silent throughout the drive, and seemed&#10;oppressed with forebodings of evil.  I talked to her reassuringly,&#10;pointing out that the Martians were tied to the Pit by sheer&#10;heaviness, and at the utmost could but crawl a little out of it; but&#10;she answered only in monosyllables.  Had it not been for my promise to&#10;the innkeeper, she would, I think, have urged me to stay in&#10;Leatherhead that night.  Would that I had!  Her face, I remember, was&#10;very white as we parted.&#10;&#10;For my own part, I had been feverishly excited all day.  Something&#10;very like the war fever that occasionally runs through a civilised&#10;community had got into my blood, and in my heart I was not so very&#10;sorry that I had to return to Maybury that night.  I was even afraid&#10;that that last fusillade I had heard might mean the extermination of&#10;our invaders from Mars.  I can best express my state of mind by saying&#10;that I wanted to be in at the death.&#10;&#10;It was nearly eleven when I started to return.  The night was&#10;unexpectedly dark; to me, walking out of the lighted passage of my&#10;cousins' house, it seemed indeed black, and it was as hot and close as&#10;the day.  Overhead the clouds were driving fast, albeit not a breath&#10;stirred the shrubs about us.  My cousins' man lit both lamps.  Happily,&#10;I knew the road intimately.  My wife stood in the light of the&#10;doorway, and watched me until I jumped up into the dog cart.  Then&#10;abruptly she turned and went in, leaving my cousins side by side&#10;wishing me good hap.&#10;&#10;I was a little depressed at first with the contagion of my wife's&#10;fears, but very soon my thoughts reverted to the Martians.  At that&#10;time I was absolutely in the dark as to the course of the evening's&#10;fighting.  I did not know even the circumstances that had precipitated&#10;the conflict.  As I came through Ockham (for that was the way I&#10;returned, and not through Send and Old Woking) I saw along the western&#10;horizon a blood-red glow, which as I drew nearer, crept slowly up the&#10;sky.  The driving clouds of the gathering thunderstorm mingled there&#10;with masses of black and red smoke.&#10;&#10;Ripley Street was deserted, and except for a lighted window or so&#10;the village showed not a sign of life; but I narrowly escaped an&#10;accident at the corner of the road to Pyrford, where a knot of people&#10;stood with their backs to me.  They said nothing to me as I passed.  I&#10;do not know what they knew of the things happening beyond the hill,&#10;nor do I know if the silent houses I passed on my way were sleeping&#10;securely, or deserted and empty, or harassed and watching against the&#10;terror of the night.&#10;&#10;From Ripley until I came through Pyrford I was in the valley of the&#10;Wey, and the red glare was hidden from me.  As I ascended the little&#10;hill beyond Pyrford Church the glare came into view again, and the&#10;trees about me shivered with the first intimation of the storm that&#10;was upon me.  Then I heard midnight pealing out from Pyrford Church&#10;behind me, and then came the silhouette of Maybury Hill, with its&#10;tree-tops and roofs black and sharp against the red.&#10;&#10;Even as I beheld this a lurid green glare lit the road about me and&#10;showed the distant woods towards Addlestone.  I felt a tug at the&#10;reins.  I saw that the driving clouds had been pierced as it were by a&#10;thread of green fire, suddenly lighting their confusion and falling&#10;into the field to my left.  It was the third falling star!&#10;&#10;Close on its apparition, and blindingly violet by contrast, danced&#10;out the first lightning of the gathering storm, and the thunder burst&#10;like a rocket overhead.  The horse took the bit between his teeth and&#10;bolted.&#10;&#10;A moderate incline runs towards the foot of Maybury Hill, and down&#10;this we clattered.  Once the lightning had begun, it went on in as&#10;rapid a succession of flashes as I have ever seen.  The thunderclaps,&#10;treading one on the heels of another and with a strange crackling&#10;accompaniment, sounded more like the working of a gigantic electric&#10;machine than the usual detonating reverberations.  The flickering&#10;light was blinding and confusing, and a thin hail smote gustily at my&#10;face as I drove down the slope.&#10;&#10;At first I regarded little but the road before me, and then&#10;abruptly my attention was arrested by something that was moving&#10;rapidly down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill.  At first I took it&#10;for the wet roof of a house, but one flash following another showed it&#10;to be in swift rolling movement.  It was an elusive vision--a moment&#10;of bewildering darkness, and then, in a flash like daylight, the red&#10;masses of the Orphanage near the crest of the hill, the green tops of&#10;the pine trees, and this problematical object came out clear and sharp&#10;and bright.&#10;&#10;And this Thing I saw!  How can I describe it?  A monstrous tripod,&#10;higher than many houses, striding over the young pine trees, and&#10;smashing them aside in its career; a walking engine of glittering&#10;metal, striding now across the heather; articulate ropes of steel&#10;dangling from it, and the clattering tumult of its passage mingling&#10;with the riot of the thunder.  A flash, and it came out vividly,&#10;heeling over one way with two feet in the air, to vanish and reappear&#10;almost instantly as it seemed, with the next flash, a hundred yards&#10;nearer.  Can you imagine a milking stool tilted and bowled violently&#10;along the ground?  That was the impression those instant flashes gave.&#10;But instead of a milking stool imagine it a great body of machinery on&#10;a tripod stand.&#10;&#10;Then suddenly the trees in the pine wood ahead of me were parted,&#10;as brittle reeds are parted by a man thrusting through them; they were&#10;snapped off and driven headlong, and a second huge tripod appeared,&#10;rushing, as it seemed, headlong towards me.  And I was galloping hard&#10;to meet it! At the sight of the second monster my nerve went&#10;altogether.  Not stopping to look again, I wrenched the horse's head&#10;hard round to the right and in another moment the dog cart had heeled&#10;over upon the horse; the shafts smashed noisily, and I was flung&#10;sideways and fell heavily into a shallow pool of water.&#10;&#10;I crawled out almost immediately, and crouched, my feet still in&#10;the water, under a clump of furze.  The horse lay motionless (his neck&#10;was broken, poor brute!) and by the lightning flashes I saw the black&#10;bulk of the overturned dog cart and the silhouette of the wheel still&#10;spinning slowly.  In another moment the colossal mechanism went&#10;striding by me, and passed uphill towards Pyrford.&#10;&#10;Seen nearer, the Thing was incredibly strange, for it was no mere&#10;insensate machine driving on its way.  Machine it was, with a ringing&#10;metallic pace, and long, flexible, glittering tentacles (one of which&#10;gripped a young pine tree) swinging and rattling about its strange&#10;body.  It picked its road as it went striding along, and the brazen&#10;hood that surmounted it moved to and fro with the inevitable&#10;suggestion of a head looking about.  Behind the main body was a huge&#10;mass of white metal like a gigantic fisherman's basket, and puffs of&#10;green smoke squirted out from the joints of the limbs as the monster&#10;swept by me.  And in an instant it was gone.&#10;&#10;So much I saw then, all vaguely for the flickering of the&#10;lightning, in blinding highlights and dense black shadows.&#10;&#10;As it passed it set up an exultant deafening howl that drowned the&#10;thunder--&quot;Aloo!  Aloo!&quot;--and in another minute it was with its&#10;companion, half a mile away, stooping over something in the field.  I&#10;have no doubt this Thing in the field was the third of the ten&#10;cylinders they had fired at us from Mars.&#10;&#10;For some minutes I lay there in the rain and darkness watching, by&#10;the intermittent light, these monstrous beings of metal moving about&#10;in the distance over the hedge tops.  A thin hail was now beginning,&#10;and as it came and went their figures grew misty and then flashed into&#10;clearness again.  Now and then came a gap in the lightning, and the&#10;night swallowed them up.&#10;&#10;I was soaked with hail above and puddle water below.  It was some&#10;time before my blank astonishment would let me struggle up the bank to&#10;a drier position, or think at all of my imminent peril.&#10;&#10;Not far from me was a little one-roomed squatter's hut of wood,&#10;surrounded by a patch of potato garden.  I struggled to my feet at&#10;last, and, crouching and making use of every chance of cover, I made a&#10;run for this.  I hammered at the door, but I could not make the people&#10;hear (if there were any people inside), and after a time I desisted,&#10;and, availing myself of a ditch for the greater part of the way,&#10;succeeded in crawling, unobserved by these monstrous machines, into&#10;the pine woods towards Maybury.&#10;&#10;Under cover of this I pushed on, wet and shivering now, towards my&#10;own house.  I walked among the trees trying to find the footpath.  It&#10;was very dark indeed in the wood, for the lightning was now becoming&#10;infrequent, and the hail, which was pouring down in a torrent, fell in&#10;columns through the gaps in the heavy foliage.&#10;&#10;If I had fully realised the meaning of all the things I had seen I&#10;should have immediately worked my way round through Byfleet to Street&#10;Cobham, and so gone back to rejoin my wife at Leatherhead.  But that&#10;night the strangeness of things about me, and my physical&#10;wretchedness, prevented me, for I was bruised, weary, wet to the skin,&#10;deafened and blinded by the storm.&#10;&#10;I had a vague idea of going on to my own house, and that was as&#10;much motive as I had.  I staggered through the trees, fell into a&#10;ditch and bruised my knees against a plank, and finally splashed out&#10;into the lane that ran down from the College Arms.  I say splashed,&#10;for the storm water was sweeping the sand down the hill in a muddy&#10;torrent.  There in the darkness a man blundered into me and sent me&#10;reeling back.&#10;&#10;He gave a cry of terror, sprang sideways, and rushed on before I&#10;could gather my wits sufficiently to speak to him.  So heavy was the&#10;stress of the storm just at this place that I had the hardest task to&#10;win my way up the hill.  I went close up to the fence on the left and&#10;worked my way along its palings.&#10;&#10;Near the top I stumbled upon something soft, and, by a flash of&#10;lightning, saw between my feet a heap of black broadcloth and a pair&#10;of boots.  Before I could distinguish clearly how the man lay, the&#10;flicker of light had passed.  I stood over him waiting for the next&#10;flash.  When it came, I saw that he was a sturdy man, cheaply but not&#10;shabbily dressed; his head was bent under his body, and he lay&#10;crumpled up close to the fence, as though he had been flung violently&#10;against it.&#10;&#10;Overcoming the repugnance natural to one who had never before&#10;touched a dead body, I stooped and turned him over to feel for his&#10;heart.  He was quite dead.  Apparently his neck had been broken.  The&#10;lightning flashed for a third time, and his face leaped upon me.  I&#10;sprang to my feet.  It was the landlord of the Spotted Dog, whose&#10;conveyance I had taken.&#10;&#10;I stepped over him gingerly and pushed on up the hill.  I made my&#10;way by the police station and the College Arms towards my own house.&#10;Nothing was burning on the hillside, though from the common there&#10;still came a red glare and a rolling tumult of ruddy smoke beating up&#10;against the drenching hail.  So far as I could see by the flashes, the&#10;houses about me were mostly uninjured.  By the College Arms a dark&#10;heap lay in the road.&#10;&#10;Down the road towards Maybury Bridge there were voices and the&#10;sound of feet, but I had not the courage to shout or to go to them.  I&#10;let myself in with my latchkey, closed, locked and bolted the door,&#10;staggered to the foot of the staircase, and sat down.  My imagination&#10;was full of those striding metallic monsters, and of the dead body&#10;smashed against the fence.&#10;&#10;I crouched at the foot of the staircase with my back to the wall,&#10;shivering violently.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER ELEVEN&#10;&#10;AT THE WINDOW&#10;&#10;&#10;I have already said that my storms of emotion have a trick of&#10;exhausting themselves.  After a time I discovered that I was cold and&#10;wet, and with little pools of water about me on the stair carpet.  I&#10;got up almost mechanically, went into the dining room and drank some&#10;whiskey, and then I was moved to change my clothes.&#10;&#10;After I had done that I went upstairs to my study, but why I did so&#10;I do not know.  The window of my study looks over the trees and the&#10;railway towards Horsell Common.  In the hurry of our departure this&#10;window had been left open.  The passage was dark, and, by contrast with&#10;the picture the window frame enclosed, the side of the room seemed&#10;impenetrably dark.  I stopped short in the doorway.&#10;&#10;The thunderstorm had passed.  The towers of the Oriental College&#10;and the pine trees about it had gone, and very far away, lit by a&#10;vivid red glare, the common about the sand pits was visible.  Across&#10;the light huge black shapes, grotesque and strange, moved busily to&#10;and fro.&#10;&#10;It seemed indeed as if the whole country in that direction was on&#10;fire--a broad hillside set with minute tongues of flame, swaying and&#10;writhing with the gusts of the dying storm, and throwing a red&#10;reflection upon the cloud-scud above.  Every now and then a haze of&#10;smoke from some nearer conflagration drove across the window and hid&#10;the Martian shapes.  I could not see what they were doing, nor the&#10;clear form of them, nor recognise the black objects they were busied&#10;upon.  Neither could I see the nearer fire, though the reflections of&#10;it danced on the wall and ceiling of the study.  A sharp, resinous&#10;tang of burning was in the air.&#10;&#10;I closed the door noiselessly and crept towards the window.  As I&#10;did so, the view opened out until, on the one hand, it reached to the&#10;houses about Woking station, and on the other to the charred and&#10;blackened pine woods of Byfleet.  There was a light down below the&#10;hill, on the railway, near the arch, and several of the houses along&#10;the Maybury road and the streets near the station were glowing ruins.&#10;The light upon the railway puzzled me at first; there were a black&#10;heap and a vivid glare, and to the right of that a row of yellow&#10;oblongs.  Then I perceived this was a wrecked train, the fore part&#10;smashed and on fire, the hinder carriages still upon the rails.&#10;&#10;Between these three main centres of light--the houses, the train,&#10;and the burning county towards Chobham--stretched irregular patches of&#10;dark country, broken here and there by intervals of dimly glowing and&#10;smoking ground.  It was the strangest spectacle, that black expanse set&#10;with fire.  It reminded me, more than anything else, of the Potteries&#10;at night.  At first I could distinguish no people at all, though I&#10;peered intently for them.  Later I saw against the light of Woking&#10;station a number of black figures hurrying one after the other across&#10;the line.&#10;&#10;And this was the little world in which I had been living securely&#10;for years, this fiery chaos!  What had happened in the last seven&#10;hours I still did not know; nor did I know, though I was beginning to&#10;guess, the relation between these mechanical colossi and the sluggish&#10;lumps I had seen disgorged from the cylinder.  With a queer feeling of&#10;impersonal interest I turned my desk chair to the window, sat down,&#10;and stared at the blackened country, and particularly at the three&#10;gigantic black things that were going to and fro in the glare about&#10;the sand pits.&#10;&#10;They seemed amazingly busy.  I began to ask myself what they could&#10;be.  Were they intelligent mechanisms?  Such a thing I felt was&#10;impossible.  Or did a Martian sit within each, ruling, directing,&#10;using, much as a man's brain sits and rules in his body?  I began to&#10;compare the things to human machines, to ask myself for the first time&#10;in my life how an ironclad or a steam engine would seem to an&#10;intelligent lower animal.&#10;&#10;The storm had left the sky clear, and over the smoke of the burning&#10;land the little fading pinpoint of Mars was dropping into the west,&#10;when a soldier came into my garden.  I heard a slight scraping at the&#10;fence, and rousing myself from the lethargy that had fallen upon me, I&#10;looked down and saw him dimly, clambering over the palings.  At the&#10;sight of another human being my torpor passed, and I leaned out of the&#10;window eagerly.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hist!&quot; said I, in a whisper.&#10;&#10;He stopped astride of the fence in doubt.  Then he came over and&#10;across the lawn to the corner of the house.  He bent down and stepped&#10;softly.&#10;&#10;&quot;Who's there?&quot; he said, also whispering, standing under the window&#10;and peering up.&#10;&#10;&quot;Where are you going?&quot; I asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;God knows.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Are you trying to hide?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Come into the house,&quot; I said.&#10;&#10;I went down, unfastened the door, and let him in, and locked the&#10;door again.  I could not see his face.  He was hatless, and his coat&#10;was unbuttoned.&#10;&#10;&quot;My God!&quot; he said, as I drew him in.&#10;&#10;&quot;What has happened?&quot; I asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;What hasn't?&quot;  In the obscurity I could see he made a gesture of&#10;despair.  &quot;They wiped us out--simply wiped us out,&quot; he repeated again&#10;and again.&#10;&#10;He followed me, almost mechanically, into the dining room.&#10;&#10;&quot;Take some whiskey,&quot; I said, pouring out a stiff dose.&#10;&#10;He drank it.  Then abruptly he sat down before the table, put his&#10;head on his arms, and began to sob and weep like a little boy, in a&#10;perfect passion of emotion, while I, with a curious forgetfulness of&#10;my own recent despair, stood beside him, wondering.&#10;&#10;It was a long time before he could steady his nerves to answer my&#10;questions, and then he answered perplexingly and brokenly.  He was a&#10;driver in the artillery, and had only come into action about seven.  At&#10;that time firing was going on across the common, and it was said the&#10;first party of Martians were crawling slowly towards their second&#10;cylinder under cover of a metal shield.&#10;&#10;Later this shield staggered up on tripod legs and became the first&#10;of the fighting-machines I had seen.  The gun he drove had been&#10;unlimbered near Horsell, in order to command the sand pits, and its&#10;arrival it was that had precipitated the action.  As the limber&#10;gunners went to the rear, his horse trod in a rabbit hole and came&#10;down, throwing him into a depression of the ground.  At the same&#10;moment the gun exploded behind him, the ammunition blew up, there was&#10;fire all about him, and he found himself lying under a heap of charred&#10;dead men and dead horses.&#10;&#10;&quot;I lay still,&quot; he said, &quot;scared out of my wits, with the fore quarter&#10;of a horse atop of me.  We'd been wiped out.  And the smell--good&#10;God!  Like burnt meat!  I was hurt across the back by the fall of&#10;the horse, and there I had to lie until I felt better.  Just like&#10;parade it had been a minute before--then stumble, bang, swish!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Wiped out!&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;He had hid under the dead horse for a long time, peeping out&#10;furtively across the common.  The Cardigan men had tried a rush, in&#10;skirmishing order, at the pit, simply to be swept out of existence.&#10;Then the monster had risen to its feet and had begun to walk leisurely&#10;to and fro across the common among the few fugitives, with its&#10;headlike hood turning about exactly like the head of a cowled human&#10;being.  A kind of arm carried a complicated metallic case, about which&#10;green flashes scintillated, and out of the funnel of this there smoked&#10;the Heat-Ray.&#10;&#10;In a few minutes there was, so far as the soldier could see, not a&#10;living thing left upon the common, and every bush and tree upon it&#10;that was not already a blackened skeleton was burning.  The hussars&#10;had been on the road beyond the curvature of the ground, and he saw&#10;nothing of them.  He heard the Martians rattle for a time and then&#10;become still.  The giant saved Woking station and its cluster of houses&#10;until the last; then in a moment the Heat-Ray was brought to bear, and&#10;the town became a heap of fiery ruins.  Then the Thing shut off the&#10;Heat-Ray, and turning its back upon the artilleryman, began to waddle&#10;away towards the smouldering pine woods that sheltered the second&#10;cylinder.  As it did so a second glittering Titan built itself up out&#10;of the pit.&#10;&#10;The second monster followed the first, and at that the artilleryman&#10;began to crawl very cautiously across the hot heather ash towards&#10;Horsell.  He managed to get alive into the ditch by the side of the&#10;road, and so escaped to Woking.  There his story became ejaculatory.&#10;The place was impassable.  It seems there were a few people alive&#10;there, frantic for the most part and many burned and scalded.  He was&#10;turned aside by the fire, and hid among some almost scorching heaps of&#10;broken wall as one of the Martian giants returned.  He saw this one&#10;pursue a man, catch him up in one of its steely tentacles, and knock&#10;his head against the trunk of a pine tree.  At last, after nightfall,&#10;the artilleryman made a rush for it and got over the railway&#10;embankment.&#10;&#10;Since then he had been skulking along towards Maybury, in the hope&#10;of getting out of danger Londonward.  People were hiding in trenches&#10;and cellars, and many of the survivors had made off towards Woking&#10;village and Send.  He had been consumed with thirst until he found one&#10;of the water mains near the railway arch smashed, and the water&#10;bubbling out like a spring upon the road.&#10;&#10;That was the story I got from him, bit by bit.  He grew calmer&#10;telling me and trying to make me see the things he had seen.  He had&#10;eaten no food since midday, he told me early in his narrative, and I&#10;found some mutton and bread in the pantry and brought it into the&#10;room.  We lit no lamp for fear of attracting the Martians, and ever&#10;and again our hands would touch upon bread or meat.  As he talked,&#10;things about us came darkly out of the darkness, and the trampled&#10;bushes and broken rose trees outside the window grew distinct.  It&#10;would seem that a number of men or animals had rushed across the lawn.&#10;I began to see his face, blackened and haggard, as no doubt mine was&#10;also.&#10;&#10;When we had finished eating we went softly upstairs to my study,&#10;and I looked again out of the open window.  In one night the valley&#10;had become a valley of ashes.  The fires had dwindled now.  Where&#10;flames had been there were now streamers of smoke; but the countless&#10;ruins of shattered and gutted houses and blasted and blackened trees&#10;that the night had hidden stood out now gaunt and terrible in the&#10;pitiless light of dawn.  Yet here and there some object had had the&#10;luck to escape--a white railway signal here, the end of a greenhouse&#10;there, white and fresh amid the wreckage.  Never before in the history&#10;of warfare had destruction been so indiscriminate and so universal.&#10;And shining with the growing light of the east, three of the metallic&#10;giants stood about the pit, their cowls rotating as though they were&#10;surveying the desolation they had made.&#10;&#10;It seemed to me that the pit had been enlarged, and ever and again&#10;puffs of vivid green vapour streamed up and out of it towards the&#10;brightening dawn--streamed up, whirled, broke, and vanished.&#10;&#10;Beyond were the pillars of fire about Chobham.  They became pillars&#10;of bloodshot smoke at the first touch of day.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER TWELVE&#10;&#10;WHAT I SAW OF THE DESTRUCTION OF WEYBRIDGE AND SHEPPERTON&#10;&#10;&#10;As the dawn grew brighter we withdrew from the window from which we&#10;had watched the Martians, and went very quietly downstairs.&#10;&#10;The artilleryman agreed with me that the house was no place to stay&#10;in.  He proposed, he said, to make his way Londonward, and thence&#10;rejoin his battery--No. 12, of the Horse Artillery.  My plan was to&#10;return at once to Leatherhead; and so greatly had the strength of the&#10;Martians impressed me that I had determined to take my wife to&#10;Newhaven, and go with her out of the country forthwith.  For I already&#10;perceived clearly that the country about London must inevitably be the&#10;scene of a disastrous struggle before such creatures as these could be&#10;destroyed.&#10;&#10;Between us and Leatherhead, however, lay the third cylinder, with&#10;its guarding giants.  Had I been alone, I think I should have taken my&#10;chance and struck across country.  But the artilleryman dissuaded me:&#10;&quot;It's no kindness to the right sort of wife,&quot; he said, &quot;to make her a&#10;widow&quot;; and in the end I agreed to go with him, under cover of the&#10;woods, northward as far as Street Cobham before I parted with him.&#10;Thence I would make a big detour by Epsom to reach Leatherhead.&#10;&#10;I should have started at once, but my companion had been in active&#10;service and he knew better than that.  He made me ransack the house&#10;for a flask, which he filled with whiskey; and we lined every&#10;available pocket with packets of biscuits and slices of meat.  Then&#10;we crept out of the house, and ran as quickly as we could down the&#10;ill-made road by which I had come overnight.  The houses seemed&#10;deserted. In the road lay a group of three charred bodies close&#10;together, struck dead by the Heat-Ray; and here and there were things&#10;that people had dropped--a clock, a slipper, a silver spoon, and the&#10;like poor valuables.  At the corner turning up towards the post&#10;office a little cart, filled with boxes and furniture, and horseless,&#10;heeled over on a broken wheel.  A cash box had been hastily smashed&#10;open and thrown under the debris.&#10;&#10;Except the lodge at the Orphanage, which was still on fire, none of&#10;the houses had suffered very greatly here.  The Heat-Ray had shaved&#10;the chimney tops and passed.  Yet, save ourselves, there did not seem&#10;to be a living soul on Maybury Hill.  The majority of the inhabitants&#10;had escaped, I suppose, by way of the Old Woking road--the road I had&#10;taken when I drove to Leatherhead--or they had hidden.&#10;&#10;We went down the lane, by the body of the man in black, sodden now&#10;from the overnight hail, and broke into the woods at the foot of the&#10;hill.  We pushed through these towards the railway without meeting a&#10;soul.  The woods across the line were but the scarred and blackened&#10;ruins of woods; for the most part the trees had fallen, but a certain&#10;proportion still stood, dismal grey stems, with dark brown foliage&#10;instead of green.&#10;&#10;On our side the fire had done no more than scorch the nearer trees;&#10;it had failed to secure its footing.  In one place the woodmen had&#10;been at work on Saturday; trees, felled and freshly trimmed, lay in a&#10;clearing, with heaps of sawdust by the sawing-machine and its engine.&#10;Hard by was a temporary hut, deserted.  There was not a breath of wind&#10;this morning, and everything was strangely still.  Even the birds were&#10;hushed, and as we hurried along I and the artilleryman talked in&#10;whispers and looked now and again over our shoulders.  Once or twice&#10;we stopped to listen.&#10;&#10;After a time we drew near the road, and as we did so we heard the&#10;clatter of hoofs and saw through the tree stems three cavalry soldiers&#10;riding slowly towards Woking.  We hailed them, and they halted while&#10;we hurried towards them.  It was a lieutenant and a couple of privates&#10;of the 8th Hussars, with a stand like a theodolite, which the&#10;artilleryman told me was a heliograph.&#10;&#10;&quot;You are the first men I've seen coming this way this morning,&quot;&#10;said the lieutenant.  &quot;What's brewing?&quot;&#10;&#10;His voice and face were eager.  The men behind him stared&#10;curiously.  The artilleryman jumped down the bank into the road and&#10;saluted.&#10;&#10;&quot;Gun destroyed last night, sir.  Have been hiding.  Trying to&#10;rejoin battery, sir.  You'll come in sight of the Martians, I expect,&#10;about half a mile along this road.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What the dickens are they like?&quot; asked the lieutenant.&#10;&#10;&quot;Giants in armour, sir.  Hundred feet high.  Three legs and a body&#10;like 'luminium, with a mighty great head in a hood, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Get out!&quot; said the lieutenant.  &quot;What confounded nonsense!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You'll see, sir.  They carry a kind of box, sir, that shoots fire&#10;and strikes you dead.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What d'ye mean--a gun?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, sir,&quot; and the artilleryman began a vivid account of the Heat-Ray.&#10;Halfway through, the lieutenant interrupted him and looked up at&#10;me.  I was still standing on the bank by the side of the road.&#10;&#10;&quot;It's perfectly true,&quot; I said.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well,&quot; said the lieutenant, &quot;I suppose it's my business to see it&#10;too.  Look here&quot;--to the artilleryman--&quot;we're detailed here clearing&#10;people out of their houses.  You'd better go along and report yourself&#10;to Brigadier-General Marvin, and tell him all you know.  He's at&#10;Weybridge.  Know the way?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I do,&quot; I said; and he turned his horse southward again.&#10;&#10;&quot;Half a mile, you say?&quot; said he.&#10;&#10;&quot;At most,&quot; I answered, and pointed over the treetops southward.  He&#10;thanked me and rode on, and we saw them no more.&#10;&#10;Farther along we came upon a group of three women and two children&#10;in the road, busy clearing out a labourer's cottage.  They had&#10;got hold of a little hand truck, and were piling it up with&#10;unclean-looking bundles and shabby furniture.  They were all too&#10;assiduously engaged to talk to us as we passed.&#10;&#10;By Byfleet station we emerged from the pine trees, and found the&#10;country calm and peaceful under the morning sunlight.  We were far&#10;beyond the range of the Heat-Ray there, and had it not been for the&#10;silent desertion of some of the houses, the stirring movement of&#10;packing in others, and the knot of soldiers standing on the bridge&#10;over the railway and staring down the line towards Woking, the day&#10;would have seemed very like any other Sunday.&#10;&#10;Several farm waggons and carts were moving creakily along the road&#10;to Addlestone, and suddenly through the gate of a field we saw, across&#10;a stretch of flat meadow, six twelve-pounders standing neatly at equal&#10;distances pointing towards Woking.  The gunners stood by the guns&#10;waiting, and the ammunition waggons were at a business-like distance.&#10;The men stood almost as if under inspection.&#10;&#10;&quot;That's good!&quot; said I.  &quot;They will get one fair shot, at any rate.&quot;&#10;&#10;The artilleryman hesitated at the gate.&#10;&#10;&quot;I shall go on,&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;Farther on towards Weybridge, just over the bridge, there were a&#10;number of men in white fatigue jackets throwing up a long rampart, and&#10;more guns behind.&#10;&#10;&quot;It's bows and arrows against the lightning, anyhow,&quot; said the&#10;artilleryman.  &quot;They 'aven't seen that fire-beam yet.&quot;&#10;&#10;The officers who were not actively engaged stood and stared over&#10;the treetops southwestward, and the men digging would stop every now&#10;and again to stare in the same direction.&#10;&#10;Byfleet was in a tumult; people packing, and a score of hussars,&#10;some of them dismounted, some on horseback, were hunting them about.&#10;Three or four black government waggons, with crosses in white circles,&#10;and an old omnibus, among other vehicles, were being loaded in the&#10;village street.  There were scores of people, most of them&#10;sufficiently sabbatical to have assumed their best clothes.  The&#10;soldiers were having the greatest difficulty in making them realise&#10;the gravity of their position.  We saw one shrivelled old fellow with&#10;a huge box and a score or more of flower pots containing orchids,&#10;angrily expostulating with the corporal who would leave them behind.&#10;I stopped and gripped his arm.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you know what's over there?&quot; I said, pointing at the pine tops&#10;that hid the Martians.&#10;&#10;&quot;Eh?&quot; said he, turning.  &quot;I was explainin' these is vallyble.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Death!&quot; I shouted.  &quot;Death is coming!  Death!&quot; and leaving him to&#10;digest that if he could, I hurried on after the artillery-man.  At the&#10;corner I looked back.  The soldier had left him, and he was still&#10;standing by his box, with the pots of orchids on the lid of it, and&#10;staring vaguely over the trees.&#10;&#10;No one in Weybridge could tell us where the headquarters were&#10;established; the whole place was in such confusion as I had never seen&#10;in any town before.  Carts, carriages everywhere, the most astonishing&#10;miscellany of conveyances and horseflesh.  The respectable inhabitants&#10;of the place, men in golf and boating costumes, wives prettily&#10;dressed, were packing, river-side loafers energetically helping,&#10;children excited, and, for the most part, highly delighted at this&#10;astonishing variation of their Sunday experiences.  In the midst of it&#10;all the worthy vicar was very pluckily holding an early celebration,&#10;and his bell was jangling out above the excitement.&#10;&#10;I and the artilleryman, seated on the step of the drinking&#10;fountain, made a very passable meal upon what we had brought with&#10;us. Patrols of soldiers--here no longer hussars, but grenadiers in&#10;white--were warning people to move now or to take refuge in their&#10;cellars as soon as the firing began.  We saw as we crossed the&#10;railway bridge that a growing crowd of people had assembled in and&#10;about the railway station, and the swarming platform was piled with&#10;boxes and packages. The ordinary traffic had been stopped, I believe,&#10;in order to allow of the passage of troops and guns to Chertsey, and&#10;I have heard since that a savage struggle occurred for places in the&#10;special trains that were put on at a later hour.&#10;&#10;We remained at Weybridge until midday, and at that hour we found&#10;ourselves at the place near Shepperton Lock where the Wey and Thames&#10;join.  Part of the time we spent helping two old women to pack a&#10;little cart.  The Wey has a treble mouth, and at this point boats are&#10;to be hired, and there was a ferry across the river.  On the&#10;Shepperton side was an inn with a lawn, and beyond that the tower of&#10;Shepperton Church--it has been replaced by a spire--rose above the&#10;trees.&#10;&#10;Here we found an excited and noisy crowd of fugitives.  As yet the&#10;flight had not grown to a panic, but there were already far more&#10;people than all the boats going to and fro could enable to cross.&#10;People came panting along under heavy burdens; one husband and wife&#10;were even carrying a small outhouse door between them, with some of&#10;their household goods piled thereon.  One man told us he meant to try&#10;to get away from Shepperton station.&#10;&#10;There was a lot of shouting, and one man was even jesting.  The idea&#10;people seemed to have here was that the Martians were simply&#10;formidable human beings, who might attack and sack the town, to be&#10;certainly destroyed in the end.  Every now and then people would&#10;glance nervously across the Wey, at the meadows towards Chertsey, but&#10;everything over there was still.&#10;&#10;Across the Thames, except just where the boats landed, everything&#10;was quiet, in vivid contrast with the Surrey side.  The people who&#10;landed there from the boats went tramping off down the lane.  The big&#10;ferryboat had just made a journey.  Three or four soldiers stood on&#10;the lawn of the inn, staring and jesting at the fugitives, without&#10;offering to help.  The inn was closed, as it was now within prohibited&#10;hours.&#10;&#10;&quot;What's that?&quot; cried a boatman, and &quot;Shut up, you fool!&quot; said a man&#10;near me to a yelping dog.  Then the sound came again, this time from&#10;the direction of Chertsey, a muffled thud--the sound of a gun.&#10;&#10;The fighting was beginning.  Almost immediately unseen batteries&#10;across the river to our right, unseen because of the trees, took up&#10;the chorus, firing heavily one after the other.  A woman screamed.&#10;Everyone stood arrested by the sudden stir of battle, near us and yet&#10;invisible to us.  Nothing was to be seen save flat meadows, cows&#10;feeding unconcernedly for the most part, and silvery pollard willows&#10;motionless in the warm sunlight.&#10;&#10;&quot;The sojers'll stop 'em,&quot; said a woman beside me, doubtfully.  A&#10;haziness rose over the treetops.&#10;&#10;Then suddenly we saw a rush of smoke far away up the river, a puff&#10;of smoke that jerked up into the air and hung; and forthwith the&#10;ground heaved under foot and a heavy explosion shook the air, smashing&#10;two or three windows in the houses near, and leaving us astonished.&#10;&#10;&quot;Here they are!&quot; shouted a man in a blue jersey.  &quot;Yonder! D'yer&#10;see them?  Yonder!&quot;&#10;&#10;Quickly, one after the other, one, two, three, four of the armoured&#10;Martians appeared, far away over the little trees, across the flat&#10;meadows that stretched towards Chertsey, and striding hurriedly&#10;towards the river.  Little cowled figures they seemed at first, going&#10;with a rolling motion and as fast as flying birds.&#10;&#10;Then, advancing obliquely towards us, came a fifth.  Their armoured&#10;bodies glittered in the sun as they swept swiftly forward upon the&#10;guns, growing rapidly larger as they drew nearer.  One on the extreme&#10;left, the remotest that is, flourished a huge case high in the air,&#10;and the ghostly, terrible Heat-Ray I had already seen on Friday night&#10;smote towards Chertsey, and struck the town.&#10;&#10;At sight of these strange, swift, and terrible creatures the crowd&#10;near the water's edge seemed to me to be for a moment horror-struck.&#10;There was no screaming or shouting, but a silence.  Then a hoarse&#10;murmur and a movement of feet--a splashing from the water.  A man, too&#10;frightened to drop the portmanteau he carried on his shoulder, swung&#10;round and sent me staggering with a blow from the corner of his&#10;burden.  A woman thrust at me with her hand and rushed past me.  I&#10;turned with the rush of the people, but I was not too terrified for&#10;thought.  The terrible Heat-Ray was in my mind.  To get under water!&#10;That was it!&#10;&#10;&quot;Get under water!&quot; I shouted, unheeded.&#10;&#10;I faced about again, and rushed towards the approaching Martian,&#10;rushed right down the gravelly beach and headlong into the water.&#10;Others did the same.  A boatload of people putting back came leaping&#10;out as I rushed past.  The stones under my feet were muddy and&#10;slippery, and the river was so low that I ran perhaps twenty feet&#10;scarcely waist-deep.  Then, as the Martian towered overhead scarcely&#10;a couple of hundred yards away, I flung myself forward under the&#10;surface.  The splashes of the people in the boats leaping into the&#10;river sounded like thunderclaps in my ears.  People were landing&#10;hastily on both sides of the river.  But the Martian machine took no&#10;more notice for the moment of the people running this way and that&#10;than a man would of the confusion of ants in a nest against which his&#10;foot has kicked.  When, half suffocated, I raised my head above water,&#10;the Martian's hood pointed at the batteries that were still firing&#10;across the river, and as it advanced it swung loose what must have&#10;been the generator of the Heat-Ray.&#10;&#10;In another moment it was on the bank, and in a stride wading&#10;halfway across.  The knees of its foremost legs bent at the farther&#10;bank, and in another moment it had raised itself to its full height&#10;again, close to the village of Shepperton.  Forthwith the six guns&#10;which, unknown to anyone on the right bank, had been hidden behind the&#10;outskirts of that village, fired simultaneously.  The sudden near&#10;concussion, the last close upon the first, made my heart jump.  The&#10;monster was already raising the case generating the Heat-Ray as the&#10;first shell burst six yards above the hood.&#10;&#10;I gave a cry of astonishment.  I saw and thought nothing of the&#10;other four Martian monsters; my attention was riveted upon the nearer&#10;incident.  Simultaneously two other shells burst in the air near the&#10;body as the hood twisted round in time to receive, but not in time to&#10;dodge, the fourth shell.&#10;&#10;The shell burst clean in the face of the Thing.  The hood bulged,&#10;flashed, was whirled off in a dozen tattered fragments of red flesh&#10;and glittering metal.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hit!&quot; shouted I, with something between a scream and a cheer.&#10;&#10;I heard answering shouts from the people in the water about me.  I&#10;could have leaped out of the water with that momentary exultation.&#10;&#10;The decapitated colossus reeled like a drunken giant; but it did&#10;not fall over.  It recovered its balance by a miracle, and, no longer&#10;heeding its steps and with the camera that fired the Heat-Ray now&#10;rigidly upheld, it reeled swiftly upon Shepperton.  The living&#10;intelligence, the Martian within the hood, was slain and splashed to&#10;the four winds of heaven, and the Thing was now but a mere intricate&#10;device of metal whirling to destruction.  It drove along in a straight&#10;line, incapable of guidance.  It struck the tower of Shepperton&#10;Church, smashing it down as the impact of a battering ram might have&#10;done, swerved aside, blundered on and collapsed with tremendous force&#10;into the river out of my sight.&#10;&#10;A violent explosion shook the air, and a spout of water, steam,&#10;mud, and shattered metal shot far up into the sky.  As the camera of&#10;the Heat-Ray hit the water, the latter had immediately flashed into&#10;steam.  In another moment a huge wave, like a muddy tidal bore but&#10;almost scaldingly hot, came sweeping round the bend upstream.  I saw&#10;people struggling shorewards, and heard their screaming and shouting&#10;faintly above the seething and roar of the Martian's collapse.&#10;&#10;For a moment I heeded nothing of the heat, forgot the patent need&#10;of self-preservation.  I splashed through the tumultuous water,&#10;pushing aside a man in black to do so, until I could see round the&#10;bend.  Half a dozen deserted boats pitched aimlessly upon the&#10;confusion of the waves.  The fallen Martian came into sight&#10;downstream, lying across the river, and for the most part submerged.&#10;&#10;Thick clouds of steam were pouring off the wreckage, and through&#10;the tumultuously whirling wisps I could see, intermittently and&#10;vaguely, the gigantic limbs churning the water and flinging a splash&#10;and spray of mud and froth into the air.  The tentacles swayed and&#10;struck like living arms, and, save for the helpless purposelessness of&#10;these movements, it was as if some wounded thing were struggling for&#10;its life amid the waves.  Enormous quantities of a ruddy-brown fluid&#10;were spurting up in noisy jets out of the machine.&#10;&#10;My attention was diverted from this death flurry by a furious&#10;yelling, like that of the thing called a siren in our manufacturing&#10;towns.  A man, knee-deep near the towing path, shouted inaudibly to me&#10;and pointed.  Looking back, I saw the other Martians advancing with&#10;gigantic strides down the riverbank from the direction of Chertsey.&#10;The Shepperton guns spoke this time unavailingly.&#10;&#10;At that I ducked at once under water, and, holding my breath until&#10;movement was an agony, blundered painfully ahead under the surface as&#10;long as I could.  The water was in a tumult about me, and rapidly&#10;growing hotter.&#10;&#10;When for a moment I raised my head to take breath and throw the&#10;hair and water from my eyes, the steam was rising in a whirling white&#10;fog that at first hid the Martians altogether.  The noise was&#10;deafening.  Then I saw them dimly, colossal figures of grey, magnified&#10;by the mist.  They had passed by me, and two were stooping over the&#10;frothing, tumultuous ruins of their comrade.&#10;&#10;The third and fourth stood beside him in the water, one perhaps two&#10;hundred yards from me, the other towards Laleham.  The generators of&#10;the Heat-Rays waved high, and the hissing beams smote down this way&#10;and that.&#10;&#10;The air was full of sound, a deafening and confusing conflict of&#10;noises--the clangorous din of the Martians, the crash of falling&#10;houses, the thud of trees, fences, sheds flashing into flame, and the&#10;crackling and roaring of fire.  Dense black smoke was leaping up to&#10;mingle with the steam from the river, and as the Heat-Ray went to and&#10;fro over Weybridge its impact was marked by flashes of incandescent&#10;white, that gave place at once to a smoky dance of lurid flames.  The&#10;nearer houses still stood intact, awaiting their fate, shadowy, faint&#10;and pallid in the steam, with the fire behind them going to and fro.&#10;&#10;For a moment perhaps I stood there, breast-high in the almost&#10;boiling water, dumbfounded at my position, hopeless of escape.  Through&#10;the reek I could see the people who had been with me in the river&#10;scrambling out of the water through the reeds, like little frogs&#10;hurrying through grass from the advance of a man, or running to and&#10;fro in utter dismay on the towing path.&#10;&#10;Then suddenly the white flashes of the Heat-Ray came leaping&#10;towards me.  The houses caved in as they dissolved at its touch, and&#10;darted out flames; the trees changed to fire with a roar.  The Ray&#10;flickered up and down the towing path, licking off the people who ran&#10;this way and that, and came down to the water's edge not fifty yards&#10;from where I stood.  It swept across the river to Shepperton, and the&#10;water in its track rose in a boiling weal crested with steam.  I&#10;turned shoreward.&#10;&#10;In another moment the huge wave, well-nigh at the boiling-point had&#10;rushed upon me.  I screamed aloud, and scalded, half blinded,&#10;agonised, I staggered through the leaping, hissing water towards the&#10;shore.  Had my foot stumbled, it would have been the end.  I fell&#10;helplessly, in full sight of the Martians, upon the broad, bare&#10;gravelly spit that runs down to mark the angle of the Wey and Thames.&#10;I expected nothing but death.&#10;&#10;I have a dim memory of the foot of a Martian coming down within a&#10;score of yards of my head, driving straight into the loose gravel,&#10;whirling it this way and that and lifting again; of a long suspense,&#10;and then of the four carrying the debris of their comrade between&#10;them, now clear and then presently faint through a veil of smoke,&#10;receding interminably, as it seemed to me, across a vast space of&#10;river and meadow.  And then, very slowly, I realised that by a miracle&#10;I had escaped.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER THIRTEEN&#10;&#10;HOW I FELL IN WITH THE CURATE&#10;&#10;&#10;After getting this sudden lesson in the power of terrestrial&#10;weapons, the Martians retreated to their original position upon&#10;Horsell Common; and in their haste, and encumbered with the debris of&#10;their smashed companion, they no doubt overlooked many such a stray&#10;and negligible victim as myself.  Had they left their comrade and&#10;pushed on forthwith, there was nothing at that time between them and&#10;London but batteries of twelve-pounder guns, and they would certainly&#10;have reached the capital in advance of the tidings of their approach;&#10;as sudden, dreadful, and destructive their advent would have been as&#10;the earthquake that destroyed Lisbon a century ago.&#10;&#10;But they were in no hurry.  Cylinder followed cylinder on its&#10;interplanetary flight; every twenty-four hours brought them&#10;reinforcement.  And meanwhile the military and naval authorities, now&#10;fully alive to the tremendous power of their antagonists, worked with&#10;furious energy.  Every minute a fresh gun came into position until,&#10;before twilight, every copse, every row of suburban villas on the&#10;hilly slopes about Kingston and Richmond, masked an expectant black&#10;muzzle.  And through the charred and desolated area--perhaps twenty&#10;square miles altogether--that encircled the Martian encampment on&#10;Horsell Common, through charred and ruined villages among the green&#10;trees, through the blackened and smoking arcades that had been but a&#10;day ago pine spinneys, crawled the devoted scouts with the heliographs&#10;that were presently to warn the gunners of the Martian approach.  But&#10;the Martians now understood our command of artillery and the danger of&#10;human proximity, and not a man ventured within a mile of either&#10;cylinder, save at the price of his life.&#10;&#10;It would seem that these giants spent the earlier part of the&#10;afternoon in going to and fro, transferring everything from the second&#10;and third cylinders--the second in Addlestone Golf Links and the third&#10;at Pyrford--to their original pit on Horsell Common.  Over that, above&#10;the blackened heather and ruined buildings that stretched far and&#10;wide, stood one as sentinel, while the rest abandoned their vast&#10;fighting-machines and descended into the pit.  They were hard at work&#10;there far into the night, and the towering pillar of dense green smoke&#10;that rose therefrom could be seen from the hills about Merrow, and&#10;even, it is said, from Banstead and Epsom Downs.&#10;&#10;And while the Martians behind me were thus preparing for their next&#10;sally, and in front of me Humanity gathered for the battle, I made my&#10;way with infinite pains and labour from the fire and smoke of burning&#10;Weybridge towards London.&#10;&#10;I saw an abandoned boat, very small and remote, drifting down-stream;&#10;and throwing off the most of my sodden clothes, I went after it,&#10;gained it, and so escaped out of that destruction.  There were no&#10;oars in the boat, but I contrived to paddle, as well as my parboiled&#10;hands would allow, down the river towards Halliford and Walton, going&#10;very tediously and continually looking behind me, as you may well&#10;understand.  I followed the river, because I considered that the water&#10;gave me my best chance of escape should these giants return.&#10;&#10;The hot water from the Martian's overthrow drifted downstream with&#10;me, so that for the best part of a mile I could see little of either&#10;bank.  Once, however, I made out a string of black figures hurrying&#10;across the meadows from the direction of Weybridge.  Halliford, it&#10;seemed, was deserted, and several of the houses facing the river were&#10;on fire.  It was strange to see the place quite tranquil, quite&#10;desolate under the hot blue sky, with the smoke and little threads of&#10;flame going straight up into the heat of the afternoon.  Never before&#10;had I seen houses burning without the accompaniment of an obstructive&#10;crowd.  A little farther on the dry reeds up the bank were smoking and&#10;glowing, and a line of fire inland was marching steadily across a late&#10;field of hay.&#10;&#10;For a long time I drifted, so painful and weary was I after the&#10;violence I had been through, and so intense the heat upon the water.&#10;Then my fears got the better of me again, and I resumed my paddling.&#10;The sun scorched my bare back.  At last, as the bridge at Walton was&#10;coming into sight round the bend, my fever and faintness overcame my&#10;fears, and I landed on the Middlesex bank and lay down, deadly sick,&#10;amid the long grass.  I suppose the time was then about four or five&#10;o'clock.  I got up presently, walked perhaps half a mile without&#10;meeting a soul, and then lay down again in the shadow of a hedge.  I&#10;seem to remember talking, wanderingly, to myself during that last&#10;spurt.  I was also very thirsty, and bitterly regretful I had drunk no&#10;more water.  It is a curious thing that I felt angry with my wife; I&#10;cannot account for it, but my impotent desire to reach Leatherhead&#10;worried me excessively.&#10;&#10;I do not clearly remember the arrival of the curate, so that probably&#10;I dozed.  I became aware of him as a seated figure in soot-smudged&#10;shirt sleeves, and with his upturned, clean-shaven face staring at&#10;a faint flickering that danced over the sky.  The sky was what is&#10;called a mackerel sky--rows and rows of faint down-plumes of&#10;cloud, just tinted with the midsummer sunset.&#10;&#10;I sat up, and at the rustle of my motion he looked at me quickly.&#10;&#10;&quot;Have you any water?&quot; I asked abruptly.&#10;&#10;He shook his head.&#10;&#10;&quot;You have been asking for water for the last hour,&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;For a moment we were silent, taking stock of each other.  I&#10;dare say he found me a strange enough figure, naked, save for my&#10;water-soaked trousers and socks, scalded, and my face and shoulders&#10;blackened by the smoke.  His face was a fair weakness, his chin&#10;retreated, and his hair lay in crisp, almost flaxen curls on his low&#10;forehead; his eyes were rather large, pale blue, and blankly staring.&#10;He spoke abruptly, looking vacantly away from me.&#10;&#10;&quot;What does it mean?&quot; he said.  &quot;What do these things mean?&quot;&#10;&#10;I stared at him and made no answer.&#10;&#10;He extended a thin white hand and spoke in almost a complaining&#10;tone.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why are these things permitted?  What sins have we done?  The&#10;morning service was over, I was walking through the roads to clear my&#10;brain for the afternoon, and then--fire, earthquake, death!  As if it&#10;were Sodom and Gomorrah!  All our work undone, all the work---- What&#10;are these Martians?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What are we?&quot; I answered, clearing my throat.&#10;&#10;He gripped his knees and turned to look at me again.  For half a&#10;minute, perhaps, he stared silently.&#10;&#10;&quot;I was walking through the roads to clear my brain,&quot; he said.  &quot;And&#10;suddenly--fire, earthquake, death!&quot;&#10;&#10;He relapsed into silence, with his chin now sunken almost to his&#10;knees.&#10;&#10;Presently he began waving his hand.&#10;&#10;&quot;All the work--all the Sunday schools--What have we done--what has&#10;Weybridge done?  Everything gone--everything destroyed.  The church!&#10;We rebuilt it only three years ago.  Gone!  Swept out of existence!&#10;Why?&quot;&#10;&#10;Another pause, and he broke out again like one demented.&#10;&#10;&quot;The smoke of her burning goeth up for ever and ever!&quot; he shouted.&#10;&#10;His eyes flamed, and he pointed a lean finger in the direction of&#10;Weybridge.&#10;&#10;By this time I was beginning to take his measure.  The tremendous&#10;tragedy in which he had been involved--it was evident he was a&#10;fugitive from Weybridge--had driven him to the very verge of his&#10;reason.&#10;&#10;&quot;Are we far from Sunbury?&quot; I said, in a matter-of-fact tone.&#10;&#10;&quot;What are we to do?&quot; he asked.  &quot;Are these creatures everywhere?&#10;Has the earth been given over to them?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Are we far from Sunbury?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Only this morning I officiated at early celebration----&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Things have changed,&quot; I said, quietly.  &quot;You must keep your head.&#10;There is still hope.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Hope!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.  Plentiful hope--for all this destruction!&quot;&#10;&#10;I began to explain my view of our position.  He listened at first,&#10;but as I went on the interest dawning in his eyes gave place to their&#10;former stare, and his regard wandered from me.&#10;&#10;&quot;This must be the beginning of the end,&quot; he said, interrupting me.&#10;&quot;The end!  The great and terrible day of the Lord!  When men shall&#10;call upon the mountains and the rocks to fall upon them and hide&#10;them--hide them from the face of Him that sitteth upon the throne!&quot;&#10;&#10;I began to understand the position.  I ceased my laboured&#10;reasoning, struggled to my feet, and, standing over him, laid my hand&#10;on his shoulder.&#10;&#10;&quot;Be a man!&quot; said I.  &quot;You are scared out of your wits!  What good&#10;is religion if it collapses under calamity?  Think of what earthquakes&#10;and floods, wars and volcanoes, have done before to men!  Did you&#10;think God had exempted Weybridge?  He is not an insurance agent.&quot;&#10;&#10;For a time he sat in blank silence.&#10;&#10;&quot;But how can we escape?&quot; he asked, suddenly.  &quot;They are&#10;invulnerable, they are pitiless.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Neither the one nor, perhaps, the other,&quot; I answered. &quot;And the&#10;mightier they are the more sane and wary should we be.  One of them&#10;was killed yonder not three hours ago.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Killed!&quot; he said, staring about him.  &quot;How can God's ministers be&#10;killed?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I saw it happen.&quot; I proceeded to tell him.  &quot;We have chanced to&#10;come in for the thick of it,&quot; said I, &quot;and that is all.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What is that flicker in the sky?&quot; he asked abruptly.&#10;&#10;I told him it was the heliograph signalling--that it was the sign&#10;of human help and effort in the sky.&#10;&#10;&quot;We are in the midst of it,&quot; I said, &quot;quiet as it is.  That flicker&#10;in the sky tells of the gathering storm.  Yonder, I take it are the&#10;Martians, and Londonward, where those hills rise about Richmond and&#10;Kingston and the trees give cover, earthworks are being thrown up and&#10;guns are being placed.  Presently the Martians will be coming this way&#10;again.&quot;&#10;&#10;And even as I spoke he sprang to his feet and stopped me by a&#10;gesture.&#10;&#10;&quot;Listen!&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;From beyond the low hills across the water came the dull resonance&#10;of distant guns and a remote weird crying.  Then everything was still.&#10;A cockchafer came droning over the hedge and past us.  High in the&#10;west the crescent moon hung faint and pale above the smoke of&#10;Weybridge and Shepperton and the hot, still splendour of the sunset.&#10;&#10;&quot;We had better follow this path,&quot; I said, &quot;northward.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER FOURTEEN&#10;&#10;IN LONDON&#10;&#10;&#10;My younger brother was in London when the Martians fell at Woking.&#10;He was a medical student working for an imminent examination, and he&#10;heard nothing of the arrival until Saturday morning.  The morning&#10;papers on Saturday contained, in addition to lengthy special articles&#10;on the planet Mars, on life in the planets, and so forth, a brief and&#10;vaguely worded telegram, all the more striking for its brevity.&#10;&#10;The Martians, alarmed by the approach of a crowd, had killed a&#10;number of people with a quick-firing gun, so the story ran.  The&#10;telegram concluded with the words: &quot;Formidable as they seem to be, the&#10;Martians have not moved from the pit into which they have fallen, and,&#10;indeed, seem incapable of doing so.  Probably this is due to the&#10;relative strength of the earth's gravitational energy.&quot;  On that last&#10;text their leader-writer expanded very comfortingly.&#10;&#10;Of course all the students in the crammer's biology class, to which&#10;my brother went that day, were intensely interested, but there were no&#10;signs of any unusual excitement in the streets.  The afternoon papers&#10;puffed scraps of news under big headlines.  They had nothing to tell&#10;beyond the movements of troops about the common, and the burning of&#10;the pine woods between Woking and Weybridge, until eight.  Then the&#10;_St. James's Gazette_, in an extra-special edition, announced the bare&#10;fact of the interruption of telegraphic communication.  This was&#10;thought to be due to the falling of burning pine trees across the&#10;line.  Nothing more of the fighting was known that night, the night of&#10;my drive to Leatherhead and back.&#10;&#10;My brother felt no anxiety about us, as he knew from the&#10;description in the papers that the cylinder was a good two miles from&#10;my house.  He made up his mind to run down that night to me, in order,&#10;as he says, to see the Things before they were killed.  He dispatched&#10;a telegram, which never reached me, about four o'clock, and spent the&#10;evening at a music hall.&#10;&#10;In London, also, on Saturday night there was a thunderstorm, and my&#10;brother reached Waterloo in a cab.  On the platform from which the&#10;midnight train usually starts he learned, after some waiting, that an&#10;accident prevented trains from reaching Woking that night.  The nature&#10;of the accident he could not ascertain; indeed, the railway&#10;authorities did not clearly know at that time.  There was very little&#10;excitement in the station, as the officials, failing to realise that&#10;anything further than a breakdown between Byfleet and Woking junction&#10;had occurred, were running the theatre trains which usually passed&#10;through Woking round by Virginia Water or Guildford.  They were busy&#10;making the necessary arrangements to alter the route of the&#10;Southampton and Portsmouth Sunday League excursions.  A nocturnal&#10;newspaper reporter, mistaking my brother for the traffic manager, to&#10;whom he bears a slight resemblance, waylaid and tried to interview&#10;him.  Few people, excepting the railway officials, connected the&#10;breakdown with the Martians.&#10;&#10;I have read, in another account of these events, that on Sunday&#10;morning &quot;all London was electrified by the news from Woking.&quot;  As a&#10;matter of fact, there was nothing to justify that very extravagant&#10;phrase.  Plenty of Londoners did not hear of the Martians until the&#10;panic of Monday morning.  Those who did took some time to realise all&#10;that the hastily worded telegrams in the Sunday papers conveyed.  The&#10;majority of people in London do not read Sunday papers.&#10;&#10;The habit of personal security, moreover, is so deeply fixed in the&#10;Londoner's mind, and startling intelligence so much a matter of course&#10;in the papers, that they could read without any personal tremors:&#10;&quot;About seven o'clock last night the Martians came out of the cylinder,&#10;and, moving about under an armour of metallic shields, have completely&#10;wrecked Woking station with the adjacent houses, and massacred an&#10;entire battalion of the Cardigan Regiment.  No details are known.&#10;Maxims have been absolutely useless against their armour; the field&#10;guns have been disabled by them.  Flying hussars have been galloping&#10;into Chertsey.  The Martians appear to be moving slowly towards&#10;Chertsey or Windsor.  Great anxiety prevails in West Surrey, and&#10;earthworks are being thrown up to check the advance Londonward.&quot;  That&#10;was how the Sunday _Sun_ put it, and a clever and remarkably prompt&#10;&quot;handbook&quot; article in the _Referee_ compared the affair to a menagerie&#10;suddenly let loose in a village.&#10;&#10;No one in London knew positively of the nature of the armoured&#10;Martians, and there was still a fixed idea that these monsters must be&#10;sluggish: &quot;crawling,&quot; &quot;creeping painfully&quot;--such expressions occurred&#10;in almost all the earlier reports.  None of the telegrams could have&#10;been written by an eyewitness of their advance.  The Sunday papers&#10;printed separate editions as further news came to hand, some even in&#10;default of it.  But there was practically nothing more to tell people&#10;until late in the afternoon, when the authorities gave the press&#10;agencies the news in their possession.  It was stated that the people&#10;of Walton and Weybridge, and all the district were pouring along the&#10;roads Londonward, and that was all.&#10;&#10;My brother went to church at the Foundling Hospital in the morning,&#10;still in ignorance of what had happened on the previous night.  There&#10;he heard allusions made to the invasion, and a special prayer for&#10;peace.  Coming out, he bought a _Referee_.  He became alarmed at the&#10;news in this, and went again to Waterloo station to find out if&#10;communication were restored.  The omnibuses, carriages, cyclists, and&#10;innumerable people walking in their best clothes seemed scarcely&#10;affected by the strange intelligence that the news venders were&#10;disseminating.  People were interested, or, if alarmed, alarmed only&#10;on account of the local residents.  At the station he heard for the&#10;first time that the Windsor and Chertsey lines were now interrupted.&#10;The porters told him that several remarkable telegrams had been&#10;received in the morning from Byfleet and Chertsey stations, but that&#10;these had abruptly ceased.  My brother could get very little precise&#10;detail out of them.&#10;&#10;&quot;There's fighting going on about Weybridge&quot; was the extent of their&#10;information.&#10;&#10;The train service was now very much disorganised.  Quite a number&#10;of people who had been expecting friends from places on the&#10;South-Western network were standing about the station.  One&#10;grey-headed old gentleman came and abused the South-Western Company&#10;bitterly to my brother.  &quot;It wants showing up,&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;One or two trains came in from Richmond, Putney, and Kingston,&#10;containing people who had gone out for a day's boating and found the&#10;locks closed and a feeling of panic in the air.  A man in a blue and&#10;white blazer addressed my brother, full of strange tidings.&#10;&#10;&quot;There's hosts of people driving into Kingston in traps and carts&#10;and things, with boxes of valuables and all that,&quot; he said.  &quot;They&#10;come from Molesey and Weybridge and Walton, and they say there's been&#10;guns heard at Chertsey, heavy firing, and that mounted soldiers have&#10;told them to get off at once because the Martians are coming.  We&#10;heard guns firing at Hampton Court station, but we thought it was&#10;thunder.  What the dickens does it all mean?  The Martians can't get&#10;out of their pit, can they?&quot;&#10;&#10;My brother could not tell him.&#10;&#10;Afterwards he found that the vague feeling of alarm had spread to&#10;the clients of the underground railway, and that the Sunday&#10;excursionists began to return from all over the South-Western&#10;&quot;lung&quot;--Barnes, Wimbledon, Richmond Park, Kew, and so forth--at&#10;unnaturally early hours; but not a soul had anything more than vague&#10;hearsay to tell of.  Everyone connected with the terminus seemed&#10;ill-tempered.&#10;&#10;About five o'clock the gathering crowd in the station was immensely&#10;excited by the opening of the line of communication, which is almost&#10;invariably closed, between the South-Eastern and the South-Western&#10;stations, and the passage of carriage trucks bearing huge guns and&#10;carriages crammed with soldiers.  These were the guns that were&#10;brought up from Woolwich and Chatham to cover Kingston.  There was&#10;an exchange of pleasantries: &quot;You'll get eaten!&quot;  &quot;We're the&#10;beast-tamers!&quot; and so forth.  A little while after that a squad of&#10;police came into the station and began to clear the public off the&#10;platforms, and my brother went out into the street again.&#10;&#10;The church bells were ringing for evensong, and a squad of&#10;Salvation Army lassies came singing down Waterloo Road.  On the bridge&#10;a number of loafers were watching a curious brown scum that came&#10;drifting down the stream in patches.  The sun was just setting, and the&#10;Clock Tower and the Houses of Parliament rose against one of the most&#10;peaceful skies it is possible to imagine, a sky of gold, barred with&#10;long transverse stripes of reddish-purple cloud.  There was talk of a&#10;floating body.  One of the men there, a reservist he said he was, told&#10;my brother he had seen the heliograph flickering in the west.&#10;&#10;In Wellington Street my brother met a couple of sturdy roughs who&#10;had just been rushed out of Fleet Street with still-wet newspapers and&#10;staring placards.  &quot;Dreadful catastrophe!&quot; they bawled one to the&#10;other down Wellington Street.  &quot;Fighting at Weybridge!  Full&#10;description!  Repulse of the Martians! London in Danger!&quot;  He had to&#10;give threepence for a copy of that paper.&#10;&#10;Then it was, and then only, that he realised something of the full&#10;power and terror of these monsters.  He learned that they were not&#10;merely a handful of small sluggish creatures, but that they were minds&#10;swaying vast mechanical bodies; and that they could move swiftly and&#10;smite with such power that even the mightiest guns could not stand&#10;against them.&#10;&#10;They were described as &quot;vast spiderlike machines, nearly a hundred&#10;feet high, capable of the speed of an express train, and able to shoot&#10;out a beam of intense heat.&quot;  Masked batteries, chiefly of field guns,&#10;had been planted in the country about Horsell Common, and especially&#10;between the Woking district and London.  Five of the machines had been&#10;seen moving towards the Thames, and one, by a happy chance, had been&#10;destroyed.  In the other cases the shells had missed, and the&#10;batteries had been at once annihilated by the Heat-Rays.  Heavy&#10;losses of soldiers were mentioned, but the tone of the dispatch was&#10;optimistic.&#10;&#10;The Martians had been repulsed; they were not invulnerable.  They&#10;had retreated to their triangle of cylinders again, in the circle&#10;about Woking.  Signallers with heliographs were pushing forward upon&#10;them from all sides.  Guns were in rapid transit from Windsor,&#10;Portsmouth, Aldershot, Woolwich--even from the north; among others,&#10;long wire-guns of ninety-five tons from Woolwich.  Altogether one&#10;hundred and sixteen were in position or being hastily placed, chiefly&#10;covering London.  Never before in England had there been such a vast&#10;or rapid concentration of military material.&#10;&#10;Any further cylinders that fell, it was hoped, could be destroyed&#10;at once by high explosives, which were being rapidly manufactured and&#10;distributed.  No doubt, ran the report, the situation was of the&#10;strangest and gravest description, but the public was exhorted to&#10;avoid and discourage panic.  No doubt the Martians were strange and&#10;terrible in the extreme, but at the outside there could not be more&#10;than twenty of them against our millions.&#10;&#10;The authorities had reason to suppose, from the size of the&#10;cylinders, that at the outside there could not be more than five in&#10;each cylinder--fifteen altogether.  And one at least was disposed&#10;of--perhaps more.  The public would be fairly warned of the approach&#10;of danger, and elaborate measures were being taken for the protection&#10;of the people in the threatened southwestern suburbs.  And so, with&#10;reiterated assurances of the safety of London and the ability of the&#10;authorities to cope with the difficulty, this quasi-proclamation&#10;closed.&#10;&#10;This was printed in enormous type on paper so fresh that it was&#10;still wet, and there had been no time to add a word of comment.  It&#10;was curious, my brother said, to see how ruthlessly the usual contents&#10;of the paper had been hacked and taken out to give this place.&#10;&#10;All down Wellington Street people could be seen fluttering out the&#10;pink sheets and reading, and the Strand was suddenly noisy with the&#10;voices of an army of hawkers following these pioneers.  Men came&#10;scrambling off buses to secure copies.  Certainly this news excited&#10;people intensely, whatever their previous apathy.  The shutters of a&#10;map shop in the Strand were being taken down, my brother said, and a&#10;man in his Sunday raiment, lemon-yellow gloves even, was visible&#10;inside the window hastily fastening maps of Surrey to the glass.&#10;&#10;Going on along the Strand to Trafalgar Square, the paper in his&#10;hand, my brother saw some of the fugitives from West Surrey.  There&#10;was a man with his wife and two boys and some articles of furniture in&#10;a cart such as greengrocers use.  He was driving from the direction of&#10;Westminster Bridge; and close behind him came a hay waggon with five&#10;or six respectable-looking people in it, and some boxes and bundles.&#10;The faces of these people were haggard, and their entire appearance&#10;contrasted conspicuously with the Sabbath-best appearance of the&#10;people on the omnibuses.  People in fashionable clothing peeped at&#10;them out of cabs.  They stopped at the Square as if undecided which&#10;way to take, and finally turned eastward along the Strand.  Some way&#10;behind these came a man in workday clothes, riding one of those&#10;old-fashioned tricycles with a small front wheel.  He was dirty and&#10;white in the face.&#10;&#10;My brother turned down towards Victoria, and met a number of such&#10;people.  He had a vague idea that he might see something of me.  He&#10;noticed an unusual number of police regulating the traffic.  Some of&#10;the refugees were exchanging news with the people on the omnibuses.&#10;One was professing to have seen the Martians.  &quot;Boilers on stilts, I&#10;tell you, striding along like men.&quot;  Most of them were excited and&#10;animated by their strange experience.&#10;&#10;Beyond Victoria the public-houses were doing a lively trade with&#10;these arrivals.  At all the street corners groups of people were&#10;reading papers, talking excitedly, or staring at these unusual Sunday&#10;visitors.  They seemed to increase as night drew on, until at last the&#10;roads, my brother said, were like Epsom High Street on a Derby Day.  My&#10;brother addressed several of these fugitives and got unsatisfactory&#10;answers from most.&#10;&#10;None of them could tell him any news of Woking except one man, who&#10;assured him that Woking had been entirely destroyed on the previous&#10;night.&#10;&#10;&quot;I come from Byfleet,&quot; he said; &quot;man on a bicycle came through the&#10;place in the early morning, and ran from door to door warning us to&#10;come away.  Then came soldiers.  We went out to look, and there were&#10;clouds of smoke to the south--nothing but smoke, and not a soul coming&#10;that way.  Then we heard the guns at Chertsey, and folks coming from&#10;Weybridge.  So I've locked up my house and come on.&quot;&#10;&#10;At the time there was a strong feeling in the streets that the&#10;authorities were to blame for their incapacity to dispose of the&#10;invaders without all this inconvenience.&#10;&#10;About eight o'clock a noise of heavy firing was distinctly audible&#10;all over the south of London.  My brother could not hear it for the&#10;traffic in the main thoroughfares, but by striking through the quiet&#10;back streets to the river he was able to distinguish it quite plainly.&#10;&#10;He walked from Westminster to his apartments near Regent's Park,&#10;about two.  He was now very anxious on my account, and disturbed at&#10;the evident magnitude of the trouble.  His mind was inclined to run,&#10;even as mine had run on Saturday, on military details.  He thought of&#10;all those silent, expectant guns, of the suddenly nomadic countryside;&#10;he tried to imagine &quot;boilers on stilts&quot; a hundred feet high.&#10;&#10;There were one or two cartloads of refugees passing along Oxford&#10;Street, and several in the Marylebone Road, but so slowly was the news&#10;spreading that Regent Street and Portland Place were full of their&#10;usual Sunday-night promenaders, albeit they talked in groups, and&#10;along the edge of Regent's Park there were as many silent couples&#10;&quot;walking out&quot; together under the scattered gas lamps as ever there had&#10;been.  The night was warm and still, and a little oppressive; the&#10;sound of guns continued intermittently, and after midnight there&#10;seemed to be sheet lightning in the south.&#10;&#10;He read and re-read the paper, fearing the worst had happened to me.&#10;He was restless, and after supper prowled out again aimlessly.  He&#10;returned and tried in vain to divert his attention to his examination&#10;notes.  He went to bed a little after midnight, and was awakened from&#10;lurid dreams in the small hours of Monday by the sound of door&#10;knockers, feet running in the street, distant drumming, and a clamour&#10;of bells.  Red reflections danced on the ceiling.  For a moment he lay&#10;astonished, wondering whether day had come or the world gone mad.&#10;Then he jumped out of bed and ran to the window.&#10;&#10;His room was an attic and as he thrust his head out, up and down&#10;the street there were a dozen echoes to the noise of his window sash,&#10;and heads in every kind of night disarray appeared.  Enquiries were&#10;being shouted.  &quot;They are coming!&quot; bawled a policeman, hammering at&#10;the door; &quot;the Martians are coming!&quot; and hurried to the next door.&#10;&#10;The sound of drumming and trumpeting came from the Albany Street&#10;Barracks, and every church within earshot was hard at work killing&#10;sleep with a vehement disorderly tocsin.  There was a noise of doors&#10;opening, and window after window in the houses opposite flashed from&#10;darkness into yellow illumination.&#10;&#10;Up the street came galloping a closed carriage, bursting abruptly&#10;into noise at the corner, rising to a clattering climax under the&#10;window, and dying away slowly in the distance.  Close on the rear of&#10;this came a couple of cabs, the forerunners of a long procession of&#10;flying vehicles, going for the most part to Chalk Farm station, where&#10;the North-Western special trains were loading up, instead of coming&#10;down the gradient into Euston.&#10;&#10;For a long time my brother stared out of the window in blank&#10;astonishment, watching the policemen hammering at door after door, and&#10;delivering their incomprehensible message.  Then the door behind him&#10;opened, and the man who lodged across the landing came in, dressed&#10;only in shirt, trousers, and slippers, his braces loose about his&#10;waist, his hair disordered from his pillow.&#10;&#10;&quot;What the devil is it?&quot; he asked.  &quot;A fire?  What a devil of a&#10;row!&quot;&#10;&#10;They both craned their heads out of the window, straining to hear&#10;what the policemen were shouting.  People were coming out of the side&#10;streets, and standing in groups at the corners talking.&#10;&#10;&quot;What the devil is it all about?&quot; said my brother's fellow lodger.&#10;&#10;My brother answered him vaguely and began to dress, running with&#10;each garment to the window in order to miss nothing of the growing&#10;excitement.  And presently men selling unnaturally early newspapers&#10;came bawling into the street:&#10;&#10;&quot;London in danger of suffocation!  The Kingston and Richmond&#10;defences forced!  Fearful massacres in the Thames Valley!&quot;&#10;&#10;And all about him--in the rooms below, in the houses on each side&#10;and across the road, and behind in the Park Terraces and in the&#10;hundred other streets of that part of Marylebone, and the Westbourne&#10;Park district and St. Pancras, and westward and northward in Kilburn&#10;and St. John's Wood and Hampstead, and eastward in Shoreditch and&#10;Highbury and Haggerston and Hoxton, and, indeed, through all the&#10;vastness of London from Ealing to East Ham--people were rubbing their&#10;eyes, and opening windows to stare out and ask aimless questions,&#10;dressing hastily as the first breath of the coming storm of Fear blew&#10;through the streets.  It was the dawn of the great panic.  London,&#10;which had gone to bed on Sunday night oblivious and inert, was&#10;awakened, in the small hours of Monday morning, to a vivid sense of&#10;danger.&#10;&#10;Unable from his window to learn what was happening, my brother went&#10;down and out into the street, just as the sky between the parapets of&#10;the houses grew pink with the early dawn.  The flying people on foot&#10;and in vehicles grew more numerous every moment.  &quot;Black Smoke!&quot; he&#10;heard people crying, and again &quot;Black Smoke!&quot;  The contagion of such&#10;a unanimous fear was inevitable.  As my brother hesitated on the&#10;door-step, he saw another news vender approaching, and got a paper&#10;forthwith.  The man was running away with the rest, and selling his&#10;papers for a shilling each as he ran--a grotesque mingling of profit&#10;and panic.&#10;&#10;And from this paper my brother read that catastrophic dispatch of&#10;the Commander-in-Chief:&#10;&#10;&quot;The Martians are able to discharge enormous clouds of a black and&#10;poisonous vapour by means of rockets.  They have smothered our&#10;batteries, destroyed Richmond, Kingston, and Wimbledon, and are&#10;advancing slowly towards London, destroying everything on the way.  It&#10;is impossible to stop them.  There is no safety from the Black Smoke&#10;but in instant flight.&quot;&#10;&#10;That was all, but it was enough.  The whole population of the great&#10;six-million city was stirring, slipping, running; presently it would&#10;be pouring _en masse_ northward.&#10;&#10;&quot;Black Smoke!&quot; the voices cried.  &quot;Fire!&quot;&#10;&#10;The bells of the neighbouring church made a jangling tumult, a cart&#10;carelessly driven smashed, amid shrieks and curses, against the water&#10;trough up the street.  Sickly yellow lights went to and fro in the&#10;houses, and some of the passing cabs flaunted unextinguished lamps.&#10;And overhead the dawn was growing brighter, clear and steady and calm.&#10;&#10;He heard footsteps running to and fro in the rooms, and up and down&#10;stairs behind him.  His landlady came to the door, loosely wrapped in&#10;dressing gown and shawl; her husband followed ejaculating.&#10;&#10;As my brother began to realise the import of all these things, he&#10;turned hastily to his own room, put all his available money--some ten&#10;pounds altogether--into his pockets, and went out again into the&#10;streets.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER FIFTEEN&#10;&#10;WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN SURREY&#10;&#10;&#10;It was while the curate had sat and talked so wildly to me under&#10;the hedge in the flat meadows near Halliford, and while my brother was&#10;watching the fugitives stream over Westminster Bridge, that the&#10;Martians had resumed the offensive.  So far as one can ascertain from&#10;the conflicting accounts that have been put forth, the majority of&#10;them remained busied with preparations in the Horsell pit until nine&#10;that night, hurrying on some operation that disengaged huge volumes of&#10;green smoke.&#10;&#10;But three certainly came out about eight o'clock and, advancing&#10;slowly and cautiously, made their way through Byfleet and Pyrford&#10;towards Ripley and Weybridge, and so came in sight of the expectant&#10;batteries against the setting sun.  These Martians did not advance in&#10;a body, but in a line, each perhaps a mile and a half from his nearest&#10;fellow.  They communicated with one another by means of sirenlike&#10;howls, running up and down the scale from one note to another.&#10;&#10;It was this howling and firing of the guns at Ripley and St.&#10;George's Hill that we had heard at Upper Halliford.  The Ripley&#10;gunners, unseasoned artillery volunteers who ought never to have been&#10;placed in such a position, fired one wild, premature, ineffectual&#10;volley, and bolted on horse and foot through the deserted village,&#10;while the Martian, without using his Heat-Ray, walked serenely over&#10;their guns, stepped gingerly among them, passed in front of them, and&#10;so came unexpectedly upon the guns in Painshill Park, which he&#10;destroyed.&#10;&#10;The St. George's Hill men, however, were better led or of a better&#10;mettle.  Hidden by a pine wood as they were, they seem to have been&#10;quite unsuspected by the Martian nearest to them.  They laid their&#10;guns as deliberately as if they had been on parade, and fired at about&#10;a thousand yards' range.&#10;&#10;The shells flashed all round him, and he was seen to advance a few&#10;paces, stagger, and go down.  Everybody yelled together, and the guns&#10;were reloaded in frantic haste.  The overthrown Martian set up a&#10;prolonged ululation, and immediately a second glittering giant,&#10;answering him, appeared over the trees to the south.  It would seem&#10;that a leg of the tripod had been smashed by one of the shells.  The&#10;whole of the second volley flew wide of the Martian on the ground,&#10;and, simultaneously, both his companions brought their Heat-Rays to&#10;bear on the battery.  The ammunition blew up, the pine trees all about&#10;the guns flashed into fire, and only one or two of the men who were&#10;already running over the crest of the hill escaped.&#10;&#10;After this it would seem that the three took counsel together and&#10;halted, and the scouts who were watching them report that they&#10;remained absolutely stationary for the next half hour.  The Martian&#10;who had been overthrown crawled tediously out of his hood, a small&#10;brown figure, oddly suggestive from that distance of a speck of&#10;blight, and apparently engaged in the repair of his support.  About&#10;nine he had finished, for his cowl was then seen above the trees&#10;again.&#10;&#10;It was a few minutes past nine that night when these three&#10;sentinels were joined by four other Martians, each carrying a thick&#10;black tube.  A similar tube was handed to each of the three, and the&#10;seven proceeded to distribute themselves at equal distances along a&#10;curved line between St. George's Hill, Weybridge, and the village of&#10;Send, southwest of Ripley.&#10;&#10;A dozen rockets sprang out of the hills before them so soon as they&#10;began to move, and warned the waiting batteries about Ditton and&#10;Esher.  At the same time four of their fighting machines, similarly&#10;armed with tubes, crossed the river, and two of them, black against&#10;the western sky, came into sight of myself and the curate as we&#10;hurried wearily and painfully along the road that runs northward out&#10;of Halliford.  They moved, as it seemed to us, upon a cloud, for a&#10;milky mist covered the fields and rose to a third of their height.&#10;&#10;At this sight the curate cried faintly in his throat, and began&#10;running; but I knew it was no good running from a Martian, and I&#10;turned aside and crawled through dewy nettles and brambles into the&#10;broad ditch by the side of the road.  He looked back, saw what I was&#10;doing, and turned to join me.&#10;&#10;The two halted, the nearer to us standing and facing Sunbury, the&#10;remoter being a grey indistinctness towards the evening star, away&#10;towards Staines.&#10;&#10;The occasional howling of the Martians had ceased; they took up&#10;their positions in the huge crescent about their cylinders in absolute&#10;silence.  It was a crescent with twelve miles between its horns.  Never&#10;since the devising of gunpowder was the beginning of a battle so&#10;still.  To us and to an observer about Ripley it would have had&#10;precisely the same effect--the Martians seemed in solitary possession&#10;of the darkling night, lit only as it was by the slender moon, the&#10;stars, the afterglow of the daylight, and the ruddy glare from St.&#10;George's Hill and the woods of Painshill.&#10;&#10;But facing that crescent everywhere--at Staines, Hounslow, Ditton,&#10;Esher, Ockham, behind hills and woods south of the river, and across&#10;the flat grass meadows to the north of it, wherever a cluster of trees&#10;or village houses gave sufficient cover--the guns were waiting.  The&#10;signal rockets burst and rained their sparks through the night and&#10;vanished, and the spirit of all those watching batteries rose to a&#10;tense expectation.  The Martians had but to advance into the line of&#10;fire, and instantly those motionless black forms of men, those guns&#10;glittering so darkly in the early night, would explode into a&#10;thunderous fury of battle.&#10;&#10;No doubt the thought that was uppermost in a thousand of those&#10;vigilant minds, even as it was uppermost in mine, was the riddle--how&#10;much they understood of us.  Did they grasp that we in our millions&#10;were organized, disciplined, working together?  Or did they interpret&#10;our spurts of fire, the sudden stinging of our shells, our steady&#10;investment of their encampment, as we should the furious unanimity of&#10;onslaught in a disturbed hive of bees?  Did they dream they might&#10;exterminate us?  (At that time no one knew what food they needed.)  A&#10;hundred such questions struggled together in my mind as I watched that&#10;vast sentinel shape.  And in the back of my mind was the sense of all&#10;the huge unknown and hidden forces Londonward.  Had they prepared&#10;pitfalls? Were the powder mills at Hounslow ready as a snare?  Would&#10;the Londoners have the heart and courage to make a greater Moscow of&#10;their mighty province of houses?&#10;&#10;Then, after an interminable time, as it seemed to us, crouching and&#10;peering through the hedge, came a sound like the distant concussion of&#10;a gun.  Another nearer, and then another.  And then the Martian beside&#10;us raised his tube on high and discharged it, gunwise, with a heavy&#10;report that made the ground heave.  The one towards Staines answered&#10;him.  There was no flash, no smoke, simply that loaded detonation.&#10;&#10;I was so excited by these heavy minute-guns following one another&#10;that I so far forgot my personal safety and my scalded hands as to&#10;clamber up into the hedge and stare towards Sunbury.  As I did so a&#10;second report followed, and a big projectile hurtled overhead towards&#10;Hounslow.  I expected at least to see smoke or fire, or some such&#10;evidence of its work.  But all I saw was the deep blue sky above, with&#10;one solitary star, and the white mist spreading wide and low beneath.&#10;And there had been no crash, no answering explosion.  The silence was&#10;restored; the minute lengthened to three.&#10;&#10;&quot;What has happened?&quot; said the curate, standing up beside me.&#10;&#10;&quot;Heaven knows!&quot; said I.&#10;&#10;A bat flickered by and vanished.  A distant tumult of shouting&#10;began and ceased.  I looked again at the Martian, and saw he was now&#10;moving eastward along the riverbank, with a swift, rolling motion.&#10;&#10;Every moment I expected the fire of some hidden battery to spring&#10;upon him; but the evening calm was unbroken.  The figure of the Martian&#10;grew smaller as he receded, and presently the mist and the gathering&#10;night had swallowed him up.  By a common impulse we clambered higher.&#10;Towards Sunbury was a dark appearance, as though a conical hill had&#10;suddenly come into being there, hiding our view of the farther&#10;country; and then, remoter across the river, over Walton, we saw&#10;another such summit.  These hill-like forms grew lower and broader&#10;even as we stared.&#10;&#10;Moved by a sudden thought, I looked northward, and there I&#10;perceived a third of these cloudy black kopjes had risen.&#10;&#10;Everything had suddenly become very still.  Far away to the&#10;southeast, marking the quiet, we heard the Martians hooting to one&#10;another, and then the air quivered again with the distant thud of&#10;their guns.  But the earthly artillery made no reply.&#10;&#10;Now at the time we could not understand these things, but later I&#10;was to learn the meaning of these ominous kopjes that gathered in the&#10;twilight.  Each of the Martians, standing in the great crescent I have&#10;described, had discharged, by means of the gunlike tube he carried, a&#10;huge canister over whatever hill, copse, cluster of houses, or other&#10;possible cover for guns, chanced to be in front of him.  Some fired&#10;only one of these, some two--as in the case of the one we had seen;&#10;the one at Ripley is said to have discharged no fewer than five at&#10;that time.  These canisters smashed on striking the ground--they did&#10;not explode--and incontinently disengaged an enormous volume of heavy,&#10;inky vapour, coiling and pouring upward in a huge and ebony cumulus&#10;cloud, a gaseous hill that sank and spread itself slowly over the&#10;surrounding country.  And the touch of that vapour, the inhaling of&#10;its pungent wisps, was death to all that breathes.&#10;&#10;It was heavy, this vapour, heavier than the densest smoke, so that,&#10;after the first tumultuous uprush and outflow of its impact, it sank&#10;down through the air and poured over the ground in a manner rather&#10;liquid than gaseous, abandoning the hills, and streaming into the&#10;valleys and ditches and watercourses even as I have heard the&#10;carbonic-acid gas that pours from volcanic clefts is wont to do.  And&#10;where it came upon water some chemical action occurred, and the&#10;surface would be instantly covered with a powdery scum that sank&#10;slowly and made way for more.  The scum was absolutely insoluble, and&#10;it is a strange thing, seeing the instant effect of the gas, that one&#10;could drink without hurt the water from which it had been strained.&#10;The vapour did not diffuse as a true gas would do.  It hung together&#10;in banks, flowing sluggishly down the slope of the land and driving&#10;reluctantly before the wind, and very slowly it combined with the mist&#10;and moisture of the air, and sank to the earth in the form of dust.&#10;Save that an unknown element giving a group of four lines in the blue&#10;of the spectrum is concerned, we are still entirely ignorant of the&#10;nature of this substance.&#10;&#10;Once the tumultuous upheaval of its dispersion was over, the black&#10;smoke clung so closely to the ground, even before its precipitation,&#10;that fifty feet up in the air, on the roofs and upper stories of high&#10;houses and on great trees, there was a chance of escaping its poison&#10;altogether, as was proved even that night at Street Cobham and Ditton.&#10;&#10;The man who escaped at the former place tells a wonderful story of&#10;the strangeness of its coiling flow, and how he looked down from the&#10;church spire and saw the houses of the village rising like ghosts out&#10;of its inky nothingness.  For a day and a half he remained there,&#10;weary, starving and sun-scorched, the earth under the blue sky and&#10;against the prospect of the distant hills a velvet-black expanse, with&#10;red roofs, green trees, and, later, black-veiled shrubs and gates,&#10;barns, outhouses, and walls, rising here and there into the sunlight.&#10;&#10;But that was at Street Cobham, where the black vapour was allowed&#10;to remain until it sank of its own accord into the ground.  As a rule&#10;the Martians, when it had served its purpose, cleared the air of it&#10;again by wading into it and directing a jet of steam upon it.&#10;&#10;This they did with the vapour banks near us, as we saw in the&#10;starlight from the window of a deserted house at Upper Halliford,&#10;whither we had returned.  From there we could see the searchlights on&#10;Richmond Hill and Kingston Hill going to and fro, and about eleven the&#10;windows rattled, and we heard the sound of the huge siege guns that&#10;had been put in position there.  These continued intermittently for&#10;the space of a quarter of an hour, sending chance shots at the&#10;invisible Martians at Hampton and Ditton, and then the pale beams of&#10;the electric light vanished, and were replaced by a bright red glow.&#10;&#10;Then the fourth cylinder fell--a brilliant green meteor--as I&#10;learned afterwards, in Bushey Park.  Before the guns on the Richmond&#10;and Kingston line of hills began, there was a fitful cannonade far&#10;away in the southwest, due, I believe, to guns being fired haphazard&#10;before the black vapour could overwhelm the gunners.&#10;&#10;So, setting about it as methodically as men might smoke out a&#10;wasps' nest, the Martians spread this strange stifling vapour over the&#10;Londonward country.  The horns of the crescent slowly moved apart,&#10;until at last they formed a line from Hanwell to Coombe and Malden.&#10;All night through their destructive tubes advanced.  Never once, after&#10;the Martian at St. George's Hill was brought down, did they give the&#10;artillery the ghost of a chance against them.  Wherever there was a&#10;possibility of guns being laid for them unseen, a fresh canister of&#10;the black vapour was discharged, and where the guns were openly&#10;displayed the Heat-Ray was brought to bear.&#10;&#10;By midnight the blazing trees along the slopes of Richmond Park and&#10;the glare of Kingston Hill threw their light upon a network of black&#10;smoke, blotting out the whole valley of the Thames and extending as&#10;far as the eye could reach.  And through this two Martians slowly&#10;waded, and turned their hissing steam jets this way and that.&#10;&#10;They were sparing of the Heat-Ray that night, either because they&#10;had but a limited supply of material for its production or because&#10;they did not wish to destroy the country but only to crush and overawe&#10;the opposition they had aroused.  In the latter aim they certainly&#10;succeeded.  Sunday night was the end of the organised opposition to&#10;their movements.  After that no body of men would stand against them,&#10;so hopeless was the enterprise.  Even the crews of the torpedo-boats&#10;and destroyers that had brought their quick-firers up the Thames&#10;refused to stop, mutinied, and went down again.  The only offensive&#10;operation men ventured upon after that night was the preparation of&#10;mines and pitfalls, and even in that their energies were frantic and&#10;spasmodic.&#10;&#10;One has to imagine, as well as one may, the fate of those batteries&#10;towards Esher, waiting so tensely in the twilight.  Survivors there&#10;were none.  One may picture the orderly expectation, the officers&#10;alert and watchful, the gunners ready, the ammunition piled to hand,&#10;the limber gunners with their horses and waggons, the groups of&#10;civilian spectators standing as near as they were permitted, the&#10;evening stillness, the ambulances and hospital tents with the burned&#10;and wounded from Weybridge; then the dull resonance of the shots the&#10;Martians fired, and the clumsy projectile whirling over the trees and&#10;houses and smashing amid the neighbouring fields.&#10;&#10;One may picture, too, the sudden shifting of the attention, the&#10;swiftly spreading coils and bellyings of that blackness advancing&#10;headlong, towering heavenward, turning the twilight to a palpable&#10;darkness, a strange and horrible antagonist of vapour striding upon&#10;its victims, men and horses near it seen dimly, running, shrieking,&#10;falling headlong, shouts of dismay, the guns suddenly abandoned, men&#10;choking and writhing on the ground, and the swift broadening-out of&#10;the opaque cone of smoke.  And then night and extinction--nothing but&#10;a silent mass of impenetrable vapour hiding its dead.&#10;&#10;Before dawn the black vapour was pouring through the streets of&#10;Richmond, and the disintegrating organism of government was, with a&#10;last expiring effort, rousing the population of London to the&#10;necessity of flight.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER SIXTEEN&#10;&#10;THE EXODUS FROM LONDON&#10;&#10;&#10;So you understand the roaring wave of fear that swept through the&#10;greatest city in the world just as Monday was dawning--the stream of&#10;flight rising swiftly to a torrent, lashing in a foaming tumult round&#10;the railway stations, banked up into a horrible struggle about the&#10;shipping in the Thames, and hurrying by every available channel&#10;northward and eastward.  By ten o'clock the police organisation, and&#10;by midday even the railway organisations, were losing coherency,&#10;losing shape and efficiency, guttering, softening, running at last in&#10;that swift liquefaction of the social body.&#10;&#10;All the railway lines north of the Thames and the South-Eastern&#10;people at Cannon Street had been warned by midnight on Sunday, and&#10;trains were being filled.  People were fighting savagely for&#10;standing-room in the carriages even at two o'clock.  By three, people&#10;were being trampled and crushed even in Bishopsgate Street, a couple&#10;of hundred yards or more from Liverpool Street station; revolvers were&#10;fired, people stabbed, and the policemen who had been sent to direct&#10;the traffic, exhausted and infuriated, were breaking the heads of the&#10;people they were called out to protect.&#10;&#10;And as the day advanced and the engine drivers and stokers refused&#10;to return to London, the pressure of the flight drove the people in an&#10;ever-thickening multitude away from the stations and along the&#10;northward-running roads.  By midday a Martian had been seen at Barnes,&#10;and a cloud of slowly sinking black vapour drove along the Thames and&#10;across the flats of Lambeth, cutting off all escape over the bridges&#10;in its sluggish advance.  Another bank drove over Ealing, and&#10;surrounded a little island of survivors on Castle Hill, alive, but&#10;unable to escape.&#10;&#10;After a fruitless struggle to get aboard a North-Western train at&#10;Chalk Farm--the engines of the trains that had loaded in the goods&#10;yard there _ploughed_ through shrieking people, and a dozen stalwart men&#10;fought to keep the crowd from crushing the driver against his&#10;furnace--my brother emerged upon the Chalk Farm road, dodged across&#10;through a hurrying swarm of vehicles, and had the luck to be foremost&#10;in the sack of a cycle shop.  The front tire of the machine he got was&#10;punctured in dragging it through the window, but he got up and off,&#10;notwithstanding, with no further injury than a cut wrist.  The steep&#10;foot of Haverstock Hill was impassable owing to several overturned&#10;horses, and my brother struck into Belsize Road.&#10;&#10;So he got out of the fury of the panic, and, skirting the Edgware&#10;Road, reached Edgware about seven, fasting and wearied, but well ahead&#10;of the crowd.  Along the road people were standing in the roadway,&#10;curious, wondering.  He was passed by a number of cyclists, some&#10;horsemen, and two motor cars.  A mile from Edgware the rim of the&#10;wheel broke, and the machine became unridable.  He left it by the&#10;roadside and trudged through the village.  There were shops half&#10;opened in the main street of the place, and people crowded on the&#10;pavement and in the doorways and windows, staring astonished at this&#10;extraordinary procession of fugitives that was beginning.  He&#10;succeeded in getting some food at an inn.&#10;&#10;For a time he remained in Edgware not knowing what next to do.  The&#10;flying people increased in number.  Many of them, like my brother,&#10;seemed inclined to loiter in the place.  There was no fresh news of&#10;the invaders from Mars.&#10;&#10;At that time the road was crowded, but as yet far from congested.&#10;Most of the fugitives at that hour were mounted on cycles, but there&#10;were soon motor cars, hansom cabs, and carriages hurrying along, and&#10;the dust hung in heavy clouds along the road to St. Albans.&#10;&#10;It was perhaps a vague idea of making his way to Chelmsford, where&#10;some friends of his lived, that at last induced my brother to strike&#10;into a quiet lane running eastward.  Presently he came upon a stile,&#10;and, crossing it, followed a footpath northeastward.  He passed near&#10;several farmhouses and some little places whose names he did not&#10;learn.  He saw few fugitives until, in a grass lane towards High&#10;Barnet, he happened upon two ladies who became his fellow travellers.&#10;He came upon them just in time to save them.&#10;&#10;He heard their screams, and, hurrying round the corner, saw a&#10;couple of men struggling to drag them out of the little pony-chaise in&#10;which they had been driving, while a third with difficulty held the&#10;frightened pony's head.  One of the ladies, a short woman dressed in&#10;white, was simply screaming; the other, a dark, slender figure,&#10;slashed at the man who gripped her arm with a whip she held in her&#10;disengaged hand.&#10;&#10;My brother immediately grasped the situation, shouted, and hurried&#10;towards the struggle.  One of the men desisted and turned towards him,&#10;and my brother, realising from his antagonist's face that a fight was&#10;unavoidable, and being an expert boxer, went into him forthwith and&#10;sent him down against the wheel of the chaise.&#10;&#10;It was no time for pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid him&#10;quiet with a kick, and gripped the collar of the man who pulled at the&#10;slender lady's arm.  He heard the clatter of hoofs, the whip stung&#10;across his face, a third antagonist struck him between the eyes, and&#10;the man he held wrenched himself free and made off down the lane in&#10;the direction from which he had come.&#10;&#10;Partly stunned, he found himself facing the man who had held the&#10;horse's head, and became aware of the chaise receding from him down&#10;the lane, swaying from side to side, and with the women in it looking&#10;back.  The man before him, a burly rough, tried to close, and he&#10;stopped him with a blow in the face.  Then, realising that he was&#10;deserted, he dodged round and made off down the lane after the chaise,&#10;with the sturdy man close behind him, and the fugitive, who had turned&#10;now, following remotely.&#10;&#10;Suddenly he stumbled and fell; his immediate pursuer went headlong,&#10;and he rose to his feet to find himself with a couple of antagonists&#10;again.  He would have had little chance against them had not the&#10;slender lady very pluckily pulled up and returned to his help.  It&#10;seems she had had a revolver all this time, but it had been under the&#10;seat when she and her companion were attacked.  She fired at six&#10;yards' distance, narrowly missing my brother.  The less courageous of&#10;the robbers made off, and his companion followed him, cursing his&#10;cowardice.  They both stopped in sight down the lane, where the third&#10;man lay insensible.&#10;&#10;&quot;Take this!&quot; said the slender lady, and she gave my brother her&#10;revolver.&#10;&#10;&quot;Go back to the chaise,&quot; said my brother, wiping the blood from his&#10;split lip.&#10;&#10;She turned without a word--they were both panting--and they went&#10;back to where the lady in white struggled to hold back the frightened&#10;pony.&#10;&#10;The robbers had evidently had enough of it.  When my brother looked&#10;again they were retreating.&#10;&#10;&quot;I'll sit here,&quot; said my brother, &quot;if I may&quot;; and he got upon the&#10;empty front seat.  The lady looked over her shoulder.&#10;&#10;&quot;Give me the reins,&quot; she said, and laid the whip along the pony's&#10;side.  In another moment a bend in the road hid the three men from my&#10;brother's eyes.&#10;&#10;So, quite unexpectedly, my brother found himself, panting, with a&#10;cut mouth, a bruised jaw, and bloodstained knuckles, driving along an&#10;unknown lane with these two women.&#10;&#10;He learned they were the wife and the younger sister of a surgeon&#10;living at Stanmore, who had come in the small hours from a dangerous&#10;case at Pinner, and heard at some railway station on his way of the&#10;Martian advance.  He had hurried home, roused the women--their servant&#10;had left them two days before--packed some provisions, put his&#10;revolver under the seat--luckily for my brother--and told them to&#10;drive on to Edgware, with the idea of getting a train there.  He&#10;stopped behind to tell the neighbours.  He would overtake them, he&#10;said, at about half past four in the morning, and now it was nearly&#10;nine and they had seen nothing of him.  They could not stop in Edgware&#10;because of the growing traffic through the place, and so they had come&#10;into this side lane.&#10;&#10;That was the story they told my brother in fragments when presently&#10;they stopped again, nearer to New Barnet.  He promised to stay with&#10;them, at least until they could determine what to do, or until the&#10;missing man arrived, and professed to be an expert shot with the&#10;revolver--a weapon strange to him--in order to give them confidence.&#10;&#10;They made a sort of encampment by the wayside, and the pony became&#10;happy in the hedge.  He told them of his own escape out of London, and&#10;all that he knew of these Martians and their ways.  The sun crept&#10;higher in the sky, and after a time their talk died out and gave place&#10;to an uneasy state of anticipation.  Several wayfarers came along the&#10;lane, and of these my brother gathered such news as he could.  Every&#10;broken answer he had deepened his impression of the great disaster&#10;that had come on humanity, deepened his persuasion of the immediate&#10;necessity for prosecuting this flight.  He urged the matter upon them.&#10;&#10;&quot;We have money,&quot; said the slender woman, and hesitated.&#10;&#10;Her eyes met my brother's, and her hesitation ended.&#10;&#10;&quot;So have I,&quot; said my brother.&#10;&#10;She explained that they had as much as thirty pounds in gold,&#10;besides a five-pound note, and suggested that with that they might get&#10;upon a train at St. Albans or New Barnet.  My brother thought that was&#10;hopeless, seeing the fury of the Londoners to crowd upon the trains,&#10;and broached his own idea of striking across Essex towards Harwich and&#10;thence escaping from the country altogether.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Elphinstone--that was the name of the woman in white--would&#10;listen to no reasoning, and kept calling upon &quot;George&quot;; but her&#10;sister-in-law was astonishingly quiet and deliberate, and at last&#10;agreed to my brother's suggestion.  So, designing to cross the Great&#10;North Road, they went on towards Barnet, my brother leading the pony&#10;to save it as much as possible.  As the sun crept up the sky the day&#10;became excessively hot, and under foot a thick, whitish sand grew&#10;burning and blinding, so that they travelled only very slowly.  The&#10;hedges were grey with dust.  And as they advanced towards Barnet a&#10;tumultuous murmuring grew stronger.&#10;&#10;They began to meet more people.  For the most part these were&#10;staring before them, murmuring indistinct questions, jaded, haggard,&#10;unclean.  One man in evening dress passed them on foot, his eyes on&#10;the ground.  They heard his voice, and, looking back at him, saw one&#10;hand clutched in his hair and the other beating invisible things.  His&#10;paroxysm of rage over, he went on his way without once looking back.&#10;&#10;As my brother's party went on towards the crossroads to the south&#10;of Barnet they saw a woman approaching the road across some fields on&#10;their left, carrying a child and with two other children; and then&#10;passed a man in dirty black, with a thick stick in one hand and a&#10;small portmanteau in the other.  Then round the corner of the lane,&#10;from between the villas that guarded it at its confluence with the&#10;high road, came a little cart drawn by a sweating black pony and&#10;driven by a sallow youth in a bowler hat, grey with dust.  There were&#10;three girls, East End factory girls, and a couple of little children&#10;crowded in the cart.&#10;&#10;&quot;This'll tike us rahnd Edgware?&quot; asked the driver, wild-eyed,&#10;white-faced; and when my brother told him it would if he turned to the&#10;left, he whipped up at once without the formality of thanks.&#10;&#10;My brother noticed a pale grey smoke or haze rising among the&#10;houses in front of them, and veiling the white facade of a terrace&#10;beyond the road that appeared between the backs of the villas.  Mrs.&#10;Elphinstone suddenly cried out at a number of tongues of smoky red&#10;flame leaping up above the houses in front of them against the hot,&#10;blue sky.  The tumultuous noise resolved itself now into the&#10;disorderly mingling of many voices, the gride of many wheels, the&#10;creaking of waggons, and the staccato of hoofs.  The lane came round&#10;sharply not fifty yards from the crossroads.&#10;&#10;&quot;Good heavens!&quot; cried Mrs. Elphinstone.  &quot;What is this you are&#10;driving us into?&quot;&#10;&#10;My brother stopped.&#10;&#10;For the main road was a boiling stream of people, a torrent of&#10;human beings rushing northward, one pressing on another.  A great bank&#10;of dust, white and luminous in the blaze of the sun, made everything&#10;within twenty feet of the ground grey and indistinct and was&#10;perpetually renewed by the hurrying feet of a dense crowd of horses&#10;and of men and women on foot, and by the wheels of vehicles of every&#10;description.&#10;&#10;&quot;Way!&quot; my brother heard voices crying.  &quot;Make way!&quot;&#10;&#10;It was like riding into the smoke of a fire to approach the meeting&#10;point of the lane and road; the crowd roared like a fire, and the dust&#10;was hot and pungent.  And, indeed, a little way up the road a villa&#10;was burning and sending rolling masses of black smoke across the road&#10;to add to the confusion.&#10;&#10;Two men came past them.  Then a dirty woman, carrying a heavy&#10;bundle and weeping.  A lost retriever dog, with hanging tongue,&#10;circled dubiously round them, scared and wretched, and fled at my&#10;brother's threat.&#10;&#10;So much as they could see of the road Londonward between the houses&#10;to the right was a tumultuous stream of dirty, hurrying people, pent&#10;in between the villas on either side; the black heads, the crowded&#10;forms, grew into distinctness as they rushed towards the corner,&#10;hurried past, and merged their individuality again in a receding&#10;multitude that was swallowed up at last in a cloud of dust.&#10;&#10;&quot;Go on!  Go on!&quot; cried the voices.  &quot;Way!  Way!&quot;&#10;&#10;One man's hands pressed on the back of another.  My brother stood&#10;at the pony's head.  Irresistibly attracted, he advanced slowly, pace&#10;by pace, down the lane.&#10;&#10;Edgware had been a scene of confusion, Chalk Farm a riotous tumult,&#10;but this was a whole population in movement.  It is hard to imagine&#10;that host.  It had no character of its own.  The figures poured out&#10;past the corner, and receded with their backs to the group in the&#10;lane.  Along the margin came those who were on foot threatened by the&#10;wheels, stumbling in the ditches, blundering into one another.&#10;&#10;The carts and carriages crowded close upon one another, making&#10;little way for those swifter and more impatient vehicles that darted&#10;forward every now and then when an opportunity showed itself of doing&#10;so, sending the people scattering against the fences and gates of the&#10;villas.&#10;&#10;&quot;Push on!&quot; was the cry.  &quot;Push on!  They are coming!&quot;&#10;&#10;In one cart stood a blind man in the uniform of the Salvation Army,&#10;gesticulating with his crooked fingers and bawling, &quot;Eternity!&#10;Eternity!&quot;  His voice was hoarse and very loud so that my brother&#10;could hear him long after he was lost to sight in the dust.  Some of&#10;the people who crowded in the carts whipped stupidly at their horses&#10;and quarrelled with other drivers; some sat motionless, staring at&#10;nothing with miserable eyes; some gnawed their hands with thirst, or&#10;lay prostrate in the bottoms of their conveyances.  The horses' bits&#10;were covered with foam, their eyes bloodshot.&#10;&#10;There were cabs, carriages, shop cars, waggons, beyond counting; a&#10;mail cart, a road-cleaner's cart marked &quot;Vestry of St. Pancras,&quot; a&#10;huge timber waggon crowded with roughs.  A brewer's dray rumbled by&#10;with its two near wheels splashed with fresh blood.&#10;&#10;&quot;Clear the way!&quot; cried the voices.  &quot;Clear the way!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Eter-nity!  Eter-nity!&quot; came echoing down the road.&#10;&#10;There were sad, haggard women tramping by, well dressed, with&#10;children that cried and stumbled, their dainty clothes smothered in&#10;dust, their weary faces smeared with tears.  With many of these came&#10;men, sometimes helpful, sometimes lowering and savage.  Fighting side&#10;by side with them pushed some weary street outcast in faded black&#10;rags, wide-eyed, loud-voiced, and foul-mouthed.  There were sturdy&#10;workmen thrusting their way along, wretched, unkempt men, clothed like&#10;clerks or shopmen, struggling spasmodically; a wounded soldier my&#10;brother noticed, men dressed in the clothes of railway porters, one&#10;wretched creature in a nightshirt with a coat thrown over it.&#10;&#10;But varied as its composition was, certain things all that host had&#10;in common.  There were fear and pain on their faces, and fear behind&#10;them.  A tumult up the road, a quarrel for a place in a waggon, sent&#10;the whole host of them quickening their pace; even a man so scared and&#10;broken that his knees bent under him was galvanised for a moment into&#10;renewed activity.  The heat and dust had already been at work upon&#10;this multitude.  Their skins were dry, their lips black and cracked.&#10;They were all thirsty, weary, and footsore.  And amid the various&#10;cries one heard disputes, reproaches, groans of weariness and fatigue;&#10;the voices of most of them were hoarse and weak.  Through it all ran a&#10;refrain:&#10;&#10;&quot;Way!  Way!  The Martians are coming!&quot;&#10;&#10;Few stopped and came aside from that flood.  The lane opened&#10;slantingly into the main road with a narrow opening, and had a&#10;delusive appearance of coming from the direction of London.  Yet a&#10;kind of eddy of people drove into its mouth; weaklings elbowed out of&#10;the stream, who for the most part rested but a moment before plunging&#10;into it again.  A little way down the lane, with two friends bending&#10;over him, lay a man with a bare leg, wrapped about with bloody rags.&#10;He was a lucky man to have friends.&#10;&#10;A little old man, with a grey military moustache and a filthy black&#10;frock coat, limped out and sat down beside the trap, removed his&#10;boot--his sock was blood-stained--shook out a pebble, and hobbled on&#10;again; and then a little girl of eight or nine, all alone, threw&#10;herself under the hedge close by my brother, weeping.&#10;&#10;&quot;I can't go on!  I can't go on!&quot;&#10;&#10;My brother woke from his torpor of astonishment and lifted her up,&#10;speaking gently to her, and carried her to Miss Elphinstone.  So soon&#10;as my brother touched her she became quite still, as if frightened.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ellen!&quot; shrieked a woman in the crowd, with tears in her&#10;voice--&quot;Ellen!&quot;  And the child suddenly darted away from my brother,&#10;crying &quot;Mother!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;They are coming,&quot; said a man on horseback, riding past along the&#10;lane.&#10;&#10;&quot;Out of the way, there!&quot; bawled a coachman, towering high; and my&#10;brother saw a closed carriage turning into the lane.&#10;&#10;The people crushed back on one another to avoid the horse.  My&#10;brother pushed the pony and chaise back into the hedge, and the man&#10;drove by and stopped at the turn of the way.  It was a carriage, with&#10;a pole for a pair of horses, but only one was in the traces.  My&#10;brother saw dimly through the dust that two men lifted out something&#10;on a white stretcher and put it gently on the grass beneath the privet&#10;hedge.&#10;&#10;One of the men came running to my brother.&#10;&#10;&quot;Where is there any water?&quot; he said.  &quot;He is dying fast, and very&#10;thirsty.  It is Lord Garrick.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Lord Garrick!&quot; said my brother; &quot;the Chief Justice?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The water?&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;&quot;There may be a tap,&quot; said my brother, &quot;in some of the houses.  We&#10;have no water.  I dare not leave my people.&quot;&#10;&#10;The man pushed against the crowd towards the gate of the corner&#10;house.&#10;&#10;&quot;Go on!&quot; said the people, thrusting at him.  &quot;They are coming!  Go&#10;on!&quot;&#10;&#10;Then my brother's attention was distracted by a bearded, eagle-faced&#10;man lugging a small handbag, which split even as my brother's&#10;eyes rested on it and disgorged a mass of sovereigns that seemed to&#10;break up into separate coins as it struck the ground.  They rolled&#10;hither and thither among the struggling feet of men and horses.  The&#10;man stopped and looked stupidly at the heap, and the shaft of a cab&#10;struck his shoulder and sent him reeling.  He gave a shriek and dodged&#10;back, and a cartwheel shaved him narrowly.&#10;&#10;&quot;Way!&quot; cried the men all about him.  &quot;Make way!&quot;&#10;&#10;So soon as the cab had passed, he flung himself, with both hands&#10;open, upon the heap of coins, and began thrusting handfuls in his&#10;pocket.  A horse rose close upon him, and in another moment, half&#10;rising, he had been borne down under the horse's hoofs.&#10;&#10;&quot;Stop!&quot; screamed my brother, and pushing a woman out of his way,&#10;tried to clutch the bit of the horse.&#10;&#10;Before he could get to it, he heard a scream under the wheels, and&#10;saw through the dust the rim passing over the poor wretch's back.  The&#10;driver of the cart slashed his whip at my brother, who ran round&#10;behind the cart.  The multitudinous shouting confused his ears.  The&#10;man was writhing in the dust among his scattered money, unable to&#10;rise, for the wheel had broken his back, and his lower limbs lay limp&#10;and dead.  My brother stood up and yelled at the next driver, and a&#10;man on a black horse came to his assistance.&#10;&#10;&quot;Get him out of the road,&quot; said he; and, clutching the man's collar&#10;with his free hand, my brother lugged him sideways.  But he still&#10;clutched after his money, and regarded my brother fiercely, hammering&#10;at his arm with a handful of gold.  &quot;Go on!  Go on!&quot; shouted angry&#10;voices behind.&#10;&#10;&quot;Way!  Way!&quot;&#10;&#10;There was a smash as the pole of a carriage crashed into the cart&#10;that the man on horseback stopped.  My brother looked up, and the man&#10;with the gold twisted his head round and bit the wrist that held his&#10;collar.  There was a concussion, and the black horse came staggering&#10;sideways, and the carthorse pushed beside it.  A hoof missed my&#10;brother's foot by a hair's breadth.  He released his grip on the&#10;fallen man and jumped back.  He saw anger change to terror on the face&#10;of the poor wretch on the ground, and in a moment he was hidden and my&#10;brother was borne backward and carried past the entrance of the lane,&#10;and had to fight hard in the torrent to recover it.&#10;&#10;He saw Miss Elphinstone covering her eyes, and a little child, with&#10;all a child's want of sympathetic imagination, staring with dilated&#10;eyes at a dusty something that lay black and still, ground and crushed&#10;under the rolling wheels.  &quot;Let us go back!&quot; he shouted, and began&#10;turning the pony round. &quot;We cannot cross this--hell,&quot; he said and they&#10;went back a hundred yards the way they had come, until the fighting&#10;crowd was hidden.  As they passed the bend in the lane my brother saw&#10;the face of the dying man in the ditch under the privet, deadly white&#10;and drawn, and shining with perspiration.  The two women sat silent,&#10;crouching in their seat and shivering.&#10;&#10;Then beyond the bend my brother stopped again.  Miss Elphinstone&#10;was white and pale, and her sister-in-law sat weeping, too wretched&#10;even to call upon &quot;George.&quot;  My brother was horrified and perplexed.&#10;So soon as they had retreated he realised how urgent and unavoidable&#10;it was to attempt this crossing.  He turned to Miss Elphinstone,&#10;suddenly resolute.&#10;&#10;&quot;We must go that way,&quot; he said, and led the pony round again.&#10;&#10;For the second time that day this girl proved her quality.  To force&#10;their way into the torrent of people, my brother plunged into the&#10;traffic and held back a cab horse, while she drove the pony across its&#10;head.  A waggon locked wheels for a moment and ripped a long splinter&#10;from the chaise.  In another moment they were caught and swept forward&#10;by the stream.  My brother, with the cabman's whip marks red across&#10;his face and hands, scrambled into the chaise and took the reins from&#10;her.&#10;&#10;&quot;Point the revolver at the man behind,&quot; he said, giving it to her,&#10;&quot;if he presses us too hard.  No!--point it at his horse.&quot;&#10;&#10;Then he began to look out for a chance of edging to the right&#10;across the road.  But once in the stream he seemed to lose volition,&#10;to become a part of that dusty rout.  They swept through Chipping&#10;Barnet with the torrent; they were nearly a mile beyond the centre of&#10;the town before they had fought across to the opposite side of the&#10;way.  It was din and confusion indescribable; but in and beyond the&#10;town the road forks repeatedly, and this to some extent relieved the&#10;stress.&#10;&#10;They struck eastward through Hadley, and there on either side of&#10;the road, and at another place farther on they came upon a great&#10;multitude of people drinking at the stream, some fighting to come at&#10;the water.  And farther on, from a lull near East Barnet, they saw&#10;two trains running slowly one after the other without signal or&#10;order--trains swarming with people, with men even among the coals&#10;behind the engines--going northward along the Great Northern Railway.&#10;My brother supposes they must have filled outside London, for at that&#10;time the furious terror of the people had rendered the central&#10;termini impossible.&#10;&#10;Near this place they halted for the rest of the afternoon, for the&#10;violence of the day had already utterly exhausted all three of them.&#10;They began to suffer the beginnings of hunger; the night was cold, and&#10;none of them dared to sleep.  And in the evening many people came&#10;hurrying along the road nearby their stopping place, fleeing from&#10;unknown dangers before them, and going in the direction from which my&#10;brother had come.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER SEVENTEEN&#10;&#10;THE &quot;THUNDER CHILD&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;Had the Martians aimed only at destruction, they might on Monday&#10;have annihilated the entire population of London, as it spread itself&#10;slowly through the home counties.  Not only along the road through&#10;Barnet, but also through Edgware and Waltham Abbey, and along the&#10;roads eastward to Southend and Shoeburyness, and south of the Thames&#10;to Deal and Broadstairs, poured the same frantic rout.  If one could&#10;have hung that June morning in a balloon in the blazing blue above&#10;London every northward and eastward road running out of the tangled&#10;maze of streets would have seemed stippled black with the streaming&#10;fugitives, each dot a human agony of terror and physical distress.  I&#10;have set forth at length in the last chapter my brother's account of&#10;the road through Chipping Barnet, in order that my readers may realise&#10;how that swarming of black dots appeared to one of those concerned.&#10;Never before in the history of the world had such a mass of human&#10;beings moved and suffered together.  The legendary hosts of Goths and&#10;Huns, the hugest armies Asia has ever seen, would have been but a drop&#10;in that current.  And this was no disciplined march; it was a&#10;stampede--a stampede gigantic and terrible--without order and without&#10;a goal, six million people unarmed and unprovisioned, driving&#10;headlong.  It was the beginning of the rout of civilisation, of the&#10;massacre of mankind.&#10;&#10;Directly below him the balloonist would have seen the network of&#10;streets far and wide, houses, churches, squares, crescents,&#10;gardens--already derelict--spread out like a huge map, and in the&#10;southward _blotted_.  Over Ealing, Richmond, Wimbledon, it would&#10;have seemed as if some monstrous pen had flung ink upon the chart.&#10;Steadily, incessantly, each black splash grew and spread, shooting out&#10;ramifications this way and that, now banking itself against rising&#10;ground, now pouring swiftly over a crest into a new-found valley,&#10;exactly as a gout of ink would spread itself upon blotting paper.&#10;&#10;And beyond, over the blue hills that rise southward of the river,&#10;the glittering Martians went to and fro, calmly and methodically&#10;spreading their poison cloud over this patch of country and then over&#10;that, laying it again with their steam jets when it had served its&#10;purpose, and taking possession of the conquered country.  They do not&#10;seem to have aimed at extermination so much as at complete&#10;demoralisation and the destruction of any opposition.  They exploded&#10;any stores of powder they came upon, cut every telegraph, and wrecked&#10;the railways here and there.  They were hamstringing mankind.  They&#10;seemed in no hurry to extend the field of their operations, and did&#10;not come beyond the central part of London all that day.  It is&#10;possible that a very considerable number of people in London stuck to&#10;their houses through Monday morning.  Certain it is that many died at&#10;home suffocated by the Black Smoke.&#10;&#10;Until about midday the Pool of London was an astonishing scene.&#10;Steamboats and shipping of all sorts lay there, tempted by the&#10;enormous sums of money offered by fugitives, and it is said that many&#10;who swam out to these vessels were thrust off with boathooks and&#10;drowned.  About one o'clock in the afternoon the thinning remnant of a&#10;cloud of the black vapour appeared between the arches of Blackfriars&#10;Bridge.  At that the Pool became a scene of mad confusion, fighting,&#10;and collision, and for some time a multitude of boats and barges&#10;jammed in the northern arch of the Tower Bridge, and the sailors and&#10;lightermen had to fight savagely against the people who swarmed upon&#10;them from the riverfront.  People were actually clambering down the&#10;piers of the bridge from above.&#10;&#10;When, an hour later, a Martian appeared beyond the Clock Tower and&#10;waded down the river, nothing but wreckage floated above Limehouse.&#10;&#10;Of the falling of the fifth cylinder I have presently to tell.  The&#10;sixth star fell at Wimbledon.  My brother, keeping watch beside the&#10;women in the chaise in a meadow, saw the green flash of it far beyond&#10;the hills.  On Tuesday the little party, still set upon getting across&#10;the sea, made its way through the swarming country towards Colchester.&#10;The news that the Martians were now in possession of the whole of&#10;London was confirmed.  They had been seen at Highgate, and even, it&#10;was said, at Neasden.  But they did not come into my brother's view&#10;until the morrow.&#10;&#10;That day the scattered multitudes began to realise the urgent need&#10;of provisions.  As they grew hungry the rights of property ceased to&#10;be regarded.  Farmers were out to defend their cattle-sheds,&#10;granaries, and ripening root crops with arms in their hands.  A number&#10;of people now, like my brother, had their faces eastward, and there&#10;were some desperate souls even going back towards London to get food.&#10;These were chiefly people from the northern suburbs, whose knowledge&#10;of the Black Smoke came by hearsay.  He heard that about half the&#10;members of the government had gathered at Birmingham, and that&#10;enormous quantities of high explosives were being prepared to be used&#10;in automatic mines across the Midland counties.&#10;&#10;He was also told that the Midland Railway Company had replaced the&#10;desertions of the first day's panic, had resumed traffic, and was&#10;running northward trains from St. Albans to relieve the congestion of&#10;the home counties.  There was also a placard in Chipping Ongar&#10;announcing that large stores of flour were available in the northern&#10;towns and that within twenty-four hours bread would be distributed&#10;among the starving people in the neighbourhood.  But this intelligence&#10;did not deter him from the plan of escape he had formed, and the three&#10;pressed eastward all day, and heard no more of the bread distribution&#10;than this promise.  Nor, as a matter of fact, did anyone else hear&#10;more of it.  That night fell the seventh star, falling upon Primrose&#10;Hill.  It fell while Miss Elphinstone was watching, for she took that&#10;duty alternately with my brother.  She saw it.&#10;&#10;On Wednesday the three fugitives--they had passed the night in a&#10;field of unripe wheat--reached Chelmsford, and there a body of the&#10;inhabitants, calling itself the Committee of Public Supply, seized the&#10;pony as provisions, and would give nothing in exchange for it but the&#10;promise of a share in it the next day.  Here there were rumours of&#10;Martians at Epping, and news of the destruction of Waltham Abbey&#10;Powder Mills in a vain attempt to blow up one of the invaders.&#10;&#10;People were watching for Martians here from the church towers.  My&#10;brother, very luckily for him as it chanced, preferred to push on at&#10;once to the coast rather than wait for food, although all three of&#10;them were very hungry.  By midday they passed through Tillingham,&#10;which, strangely enough, seemed to be quite silent and deserted, save&#10;for a few furtive plunderers hunting for food.  Near Tillingham they&#10;suddenly came in sight of the sea, and the most amazing crowd of&#10;shipping of all sorts that it is possible to imagine.&#10;&#10;For after the sailors could no longer come up the Thames, they came&#10;on to the Essex coast, to Harwich and Walton and Clacton, and&#10;afterwards to Foulness and Shoebury, to bring off the people.  They&#10;lay in a huge sickle-shaped curve that vanished into mist at last&#10;towards the Naze.  Close inshore was a multitude of fishing&#10;smacks--English, Scotch, French, Dutch, and Swedish; steam launches&#10;from the Thames, yachts, electric boats; and beyond were ships of large&#10;burden, a multitude of filthy colliers, trim merchantmen, cattle ships,&#10;passenger boats, petroleum tanks, ocean tramps, an old white transport&#10;even, neat white and grey liners from Southampton and Hamburg; and&#10;along the blue coast across the Blackwater my brother could make out&#10;dimly a dense swarm of boats chaffering with the people on the beach,&#10;a swarm which also extended up the Blackwater almost to Maldon.&#10;&#10;About a couple of miles out lay an ironclad, very low in the water,&#10;almost, to my brother's perception, like a water-logged ship.  This&#10;was the ram _Thunder Child_.  It was the only warship in sight, but far&#10;away to the right over the smooth surface of the sea--for that day&#10;there was a dead calm--lay a serpent of black smoke to mark the next&#10;ironclads of the Channel Fleet, which hovered in an extended line,&#10;steam up and ready for action, across the Thames estuary during the&#10;course of the Martian conquest, vigilant and yet powerless to prevent&#10;it.&#10;&#10;At the sight of the sea, Mrs. Elphinstone, in spite of the&#10;assurances of her sister-in-law, gave way to panic.  She had never&#10;been out of England before, she would rather die than trust herself&#10;friendless in a foreign country, and so forth.  She seemed, poor woman,&#10;to imagine that the French and the Martians might prove very similar.&#10;She had been growing increasingly hysterical, fearful, and depressed&#10;during the two days' journeyings.  Her great idea was to return to&#10;Stanmore.  Things had been always well and safe at Stanmore.  They&#10;would find George at Stanmore.&#10;&#10;It was with the greatest difficulty they could get her down to the&#10;beach, where presently my brother succeeded in attracting the&#10;attention of some men on a paddle steamer from the Thames.  They sent&#10;a boat and drove a bargain for thirty-six pounds for the three.  The&#10;steamer was going, these men said, to Ostend.&#10;&#10;It was about two o'clock when my brother, having paid their fares&#10;at the gangway, found himself safely aboard the steamboat with his&#10;charges.  There was food aboard, albeit at exorbitant prices, and the&#10;three of them contrived to eat a meal on one of the seats forward.&#10;&#10;There were already a couple of score of passengers aboard, some of&#10;whom had expended their last money in securing a passage, but the&#10;captain lay off the Blackwater until five in the afternoon, picking up&#10;passengers until the seated decks were even dangerously crowded.  He&#10;would probably have remained longer had it not been for the sound of&#10;guns that began about that hour in the south.  As if in answer, the&#10;ironclad seaward fired a small gun and hoisted a string of flags.  A&#10;jet of smoke sprang out of her funnels.&#10;&#10;Some of the passengers were of opinion that this firing came from&#10;Shoeburyness, until it was noticed that it was growing louder.  At the&#10;same time, far away in the southeast the masts and upperworks of three&#10;ironclads rose one after the other out of the sea, beneath clouds of&#10;black smoke.  But my brother's attention speedily reverted to the&#10;distant firing in the south.  He fancied he saw a column of smoke&#10;rising out of the distant grey haze.&#10;&#10;The little steamer was already flapping her way eastward of the big&#10;crescent of shipping, and the low Essex coast was growing blue and&#10;hazy, when a Martian appeared, small and faint in the remote distance,&#10;advancing along the muddy coast from the direction of Foulness.  At&#10;that the captain on the bridge swore at the top of his voice with fear&#10;and anger at his own delay, and the paddles seemed infected with his&#10;terror.  Every soul aboard stood at the bulwarks or on the seats of&#10;the steamer and stared at that distant shape, higher than the trees or&#10;church towers inland, and advancing with a leisurely parody of a human&#10;stride.&#10;&#10;It was the first Martian my brother had seen, and he stood, more&#10;amazed than terrified, watching this Titan advancing deliberately&#10;towards the shipping, wading farther and farther into the water as the&#10;coast fell away.  Then, far away beyond the Crouch, came another,&#10;striding over some stunted trees, and then yet another, still farther&#10;off, wading deeply through a shiny mudflat that seemed to hang halfway&#10;up between sea and sky.  They were all stalking seaward, as if to&#10;intercept the escape of the multitudinous vessels that were crowded&#10;between Foulness and the Naze.  In spite of the throbbing exertions of&#10;the engines of the little paddle-boat, and the pouring foam that her&#10;wheels flung behind her, she receded with terrifying slowness from&#10;this ominous advance.&#10;&#10;Glancing northwestward, my brother saw the large crescent of&#10;shipping already writhing with the approaching terror; one ship&#10;passing behind another, another coming round from broadside to end on,&#10;steamships whistling and giving off volumes of steam, sails being let&#10;out, launches rushing hither and thither.  He was so fascinated by&#10;this and by the creeping danger away to the left that he had no eyes&#10;for anything seaward.  And then a swift movement of the steamboat (she&#10;had suddenly come round to avoid being run down) flung him headlong&#10;from the seat upon which he was standing.  There was a shouting all&#10;about him, a trampling of feet, and a cheer that seemed to be answered&#10;faintly.  The steamboat lurched and rolled him over upon his hands.&#10;&#10;He sprang to his feet and saw to starboard, and not a hundred yards&#10;from their heeling, pitching boat, a vast iron bulk like the blade of&#10;a plough tearing through the water, tossing it on either side in huge&#10;waves of foam that leaped towards the steamer, flinging her paddles&#10;helplessly in the air, and then sucking her deck down almost to the&#10;waterline.&#10;&#10;A douche of spray blinded my brother for a moment.  When his eyes&#10;were clear again he saw the monster had passed and was rushing&#10;landward.  Big iron upperworks rose out of this headlong structure,&#10;and from that twin funnels projected and spat a smoking blast shot&#10;with fire.  It was the torpedo ram, _Thunder Child_, steaming headlong,&#10;coming to the rescue of the threatened shipping.&#10;&#10;Keeping his footing on the heaving deck by clutching the bulwarks,&#10;my brother looked past this charging leviathan at the Martians again,&#10;and he saw the three of them now close together, and standing so far&#10;out to sea that their tripod supports were almost entirely submerged.&#10;Thus sunken, and seen in remote perspective, they appeared far less&#10;formidable than the huge iron bulk in whose wake the steamer was&#10;pitching so helplessly.  It would seem they were regarding this new&#10;antagonist with astonishment.  To their intelligence, it may be, the&#10;giant was even such another as themselves.  The _Thunder Child_ fired no&#10;gun, but simply drove full speed towards them.  It was probably her&#10;not firing that enabled her to get so near the enemy as she did.  They&#10;did not know what to make of her.  One shell, and they would have sent&#10;her to the bottom forthwith with the Heat-Ray.&#10;&#10;She was steaming at such a pace that in a minute she seemed halfway&#10;between the steamboat and the Martians--a diminishing black bulk&#10;against the receding horizontal expanse of the Essex coast.&#10;&#10;Suddenly the foremost Martian lowered his tube and discharged a&#10;canister of the black gas at the ironclad.  It hit her larboard side&#10;and glanced off in an inky jet that rolled away to seaward, an&#10;unfolding torrent of Black Smoke, from which the ironclad drove clear.&#10;To the watchers from the steamer, low in the water and with the sun in&#10;their eyes, it seemed as though she were already among the Martians.&#10;&#10;They saw the gaunt figures separating and rising out of the water&#10;as they retreated shoreward, and one of them raised the camera-like&#10;generator of the Heat-Ray.  He held it pointing obliquely downward,&#10;and a bank of steam sprang from the water at its touch.  It must have&#10;driven through the iron of the ship's side like a white-hot iron rod&#10;through paper.&#10;&#10;A flicker of flame went up through the rising steam, and then the&#10;Martian reeled and staggered.  In another moment he was cut down, and&#10;a great body of water and steam shot high in the air.  The guns of the&#10;_Thunder Child_ sounded through the reek, going off one after the other,&#10;and one shot splashed the water high close by the steamer, ricocheted&#10;towards the other flying ships to the north, and smashed a smack to&#10;matchwood.&#10;&#10;But no one heeded that very much.  At the sight of the Martian's&#10;collapse the captain on the bridge yelled inarticulately, and all the&#10;crowding passengers on the steamer's stern shouted together.  And then&#10;they yelled again.  For, surging out beyond the white tumult, drove&#10;something long and black, the flames streaming from its middle parts,&#10;its ventilators and funnels spouting fire.&#10;&#10;She was alive still; the steering gear, it seems, was intact and&#10;her engines working.  She headed straight for a second Martian, and&#10;was within a hundred yards of him when the Heat-Ray came to bear.  Then&#10;with a violent thud, a blinding flash, her decks, her funnels, leaped&#10;upward.  The Martian staggered with the violence of her explosion, and&#10;in another moment the flaming wreckage, still driving forward with the&#10;impetus of its pace, had struck him and crumpled him up like a thing&#10;of cardboard.  My brother shouted involuntarily.  A boiling tumult of&#10;steam hid everything again.&#10;&#10;&quot;Two!&quot; yelled the captain.&#10;&#10;Everyone was shouting.  The whole steamer from end to end rang with&#10;frantic cheering that was taken up first by one and then by all in the&#10;crowding multitude of ships and boats that was driving out to sea.&#10;&#10;The steam hung upon the water for many minutes, hiding the third&#10;Martian and the coast altogether.  And all this time the boat was&#10;paddling steadily out to sea and away from the fight; and when at last&#10;the confusion cleared, the drifting bank of black vapour intervened,&#10;and nothing of the _Thunder Child_ could be made out, nor could the&#10;third Martian be seen.  But the ironclads to seaward were now quite&#10;close and standing in towards shore past the steamboat.&#10;&#10;The little vessel continued to beat its way seaward, and the&#10;ironclads receded slowly towards the coast, which was hidden still by&#10;a marbled bank of vapour, part steam, part black gas, eddying and&#10;combining in the strangest way.  The fleet of refugees was scattering&#10;to the northeast; several smacks were sailing between the ironclads&#10;and the steamboat.  After a time, and before they reached the sinking&#10;cloud bank, the warships turned northward, and then abruptly went&#10;about and passed into the thickening haze of evening southward.  The&#10;coast grew faint, and at last indistinguishable amid the low banks of&#10;clouds that were gathering about the sinking sun.&#10;&#10;Then suddenly out of the golden haze of the sunset came the&#10;vibration of guns, and a form of black shadows moving.  Everyone&#10;struggled to the rail of the steamer and peered into the blinding&#10;furnace of the west, but nothing was to be distinguished clearly.  A&#10;mass of smoke rose slanting and barred the face of the sun.  The&#10;steamboat throbbed on its way through an interminable suspense.&#10;&#10;The sun sank into grey clouds, the sky flushed and darkened, the&#10;evening star trembled into sight.  It was deep twilight when the&#10;captain cried out and pointed.  My brother strained his eyes.&#10;Something rushed up into the sky out of the greyness--rushed&#10;slantingly upward and very swiftly into the luminous clearness above&#10;the clouds in the western sky; something flat and broad, and very&#10;large, that swept round in a vast curve, grew smaller, sank slowly,&#10;and vanished again into the grey mystery of the night.  And as it flew&#10;it rained down darkness upon the land.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;BOOK TWO&#10;&#10;THE EARTH UNDER THE MARTIANS&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER ONE&#10;&#10;UNDER FOOT&#10;&#10;&#10;In the first book I have wandered so much from my own adventures to&#10;tell of the experiences of my brother that all through the last two&#10;chapters I and the curate have been lurking in the empty house at&#10;Halliford whither we fled to escape the Black Smoke.  There I will&#10;resume.  We stopped there all Sunday night and all the next day--the&#10;day of the panic--in a little island of daylight, cut off by the Black&#10;Smoke from the rest of the world.  We could do nothing but wait in&#10;aching inactivity during those two weary days.&#10;&#10;My mind was occupied by anxiety for my wife.  I figured her at&#10;Leatherhead, terrified, in danger, mourning me already as a dead man.&#10;I paced the rooms and cried aloud when I thought of how I was cut off&#10;from her, of all that might happen to her in my absence.  My cousin I&#10;knew was brave enough for any emergency, but he was not the sort of&#10;man to realise danger quickly, to rise promptly.  What was needed now&#10;was not bravery, but circumspection.  My only consolation was to&#10;believe that the Martians were moving London-ward and away from her.&#10;Such vague anxieties keep the mind sensitive and painful.  I grew very&#10;weary and irritable with the curate's perpetual ejaculations; I tired&#10;of the sight of his selfish despair.  After some ineffectual&#10;remonstrance I kept away from him, staying in a room--evidently a&#10;children's schoolroom--containing globes, forms, and copybooks.  When&#10;he followed me thither, I went to a box room at the top of the house&#10;and, in order to be alone with my aching miseries, locked myself in.&#10;&#10;We were hopelessly hemmed in by the Black Smoke all that day and&#10;the morning of the next.  There were signs of people in the next house&#10;on Sunday evening--a face at a window and moving lights, and later the&#10;slamming of a door.  But I do not know who these people were, nor what&#10;became of them.  We saw nothing of them next day.  The Black Smoke&#10;drifted slowly riverward all through Monday morning, creeping nearer&#10;and nearer to us, driving at last along the roadway outside the house&#10;that hid us.&#10;&#10;A Martian came across the fields about midday, laying the stuff&#10;with a jet of superheated steam that hissed against the walls, smashed&#10;all the windows it touched, and scalded the curate's hand as he fled&#10;out of the front room.  When at last we crept across the sodden rooms&#10;and looked out again, the country northward was as though a black&#10;snowstorm had passed over it.  Looking towards the river, we were&#10;astonished to see an unaccountable redness mingling with the black of&#10;the scorched meadows.&#10;&#10;For a time we did not see how this change affected our position,&#10;save that we were relieved of our fear of the Black Smoke.  But later&#10;I perceived that we were no longer hemmed in, that now we might get&#10;away.  So soon as I realised that the way of escape was open, my dream&#10;of action returned.  But the curate was lethargic, unreasonable.&#10;&#10;&quot;We are safe here,&quot; he repeated; &quot;safe here.&quot;&#10;&#10;I resolved to leave him--would that I had!  Wiser now for the&#10;artilleryman's teaching, I sought out food and drink.  I had found oil&#10;and rags for my burns, and I also took a hat and a flannel shirt that&#10;I found in one of the bedrooms.  When it was clear to him that I meant&#10;to go alone--had reconciled myself to going alone--he suddenly roused&#10;himself to come.  And all being quiet throughout the afternoon, we&#10;started about five o'clock, as I should judge, along the blackened&#10;road to Sunbury.&#10;&#10;In Sunbury, and at intervals along the road, were dead bodies lying&#10;in contorted attitudes, horses as well as men, overturned carts and&#10;luggage, all covered thickly with black dust.  That pall of cindery&#10;powder made me think of what I had read of the destruction of Pompeii.&#10;We got to Hampton Court without misadventure, our minds full of&#10;strange and unfamiliar appearances, and at Hampton Court our eyes were&#10;relieved to find a patch of green that had escaped the suffocating&#10;drift.  We went through Bushey Park, with its deer going to and fro&#10;under the chestnuts, and some men and women hurrying in the distance&#10;towards Hampton, and so we came to Twickenham.  These were the first&#10;people we saw.&#10;&#10;Away across the road the woods beyond Ham and Petersham were still&#10;afire.  Twickenham was uninjured by either Heat-Ray or Black Smoke,&#10;and there were more people about here, though none could give us news.&#10;For the most part they were like ourselves, taking advantage of a lull&#10;to shift their quarters.  I have an impression that many of the houses&#10;here were still occupied by scared inhabitants, too frightened even&#10;for flight.  Here too the evidence of a hasty rout was abundant along&#10;the road.  I remember most vividly three smashed bicycles in a heap,&#10;pounded into the road by the wheels of subsequent carts.  We crossed&#10;Richmond Bridge about half past eight.  We hurried across the exposed&#10;bridge, of course, but I noticed floating down the stream a number&#10;of red masses, some many feet across.  I did not know what these&#10;were--there was no time for scrutiny--and I put a more horrible&#10;interpretation on them than they deserved.  Here again on the Surrey&#10;side were black dust that had once been smoke, and dead bodies--a heap&#10;near the approach to the station; but we had no glimpse of the&#10;Martians until we were some way towards Barnes.&#10;&#10;We saw in the blackened distance a group of three people running&#10;down a side street towards the river, but otherwise it seemed&#10;deserted.  Up the hill Richmond town was burning briskly; outside the&#10;town of Richmond there was no trace of the Black Smoke.&#10;&#10;Then suddenly, as we approached Kew, came a number of people&#10;running, and the upperworks of a Martian fighting-machine loomed in&#10;sight over the housetops, not a hundred yards away from us.  We stood&#10;aghast at our danger, and had the Martian looked down we must&#10;immediately have perished.  We were so terrified that we dared not go&#10;on, but turned aside and hid in a shed in a garden.  There the curate&#10;crouched, weeping silently, and refusing to stir again.&#10;&#10;But my fixed idea of reaching Leatherhead would not let me rest,&#10;and in the twilight I ventured out again.  I went through a shrubbery,&#10;and along a passage beside a big house standing in its own grounds,&#10;and so emerged upon the road towards Kew.  The curate I left in the&#10;shed, but he came hurrying after me.&#10;&#10;That second start was the most foolhardy thing I ever did.  For it&#10;was manifest the Martians were about us.  No sooner had the curate&#10;overtaken me than we saw either the fighting-machine we had seen&#10;before or another, far away across the meadows in the direction of Kew&#10;Lodge.  Four or five little black figures hurried before it across the&#10;green-grey of the field, and in a moment it was evident this Martian&#10;pursued them.  In three strides he was among them, and they ran&#10;radiating from his feet in all directions.  He used no Heat-Ray to&#10;destroy them, but picked them up one by one.  Apparently he tossed&#10;them into the great metallic carrier which projected behind him, much&#10;as a workman's basket hangs over his shoulder.&#10;&#10;It was the first time I realised that the Martians might have any&#10;other purpose than destruction with defeated humanity.  We stood for a&#10;moment petrified, then turned and fled through a gate behind us into a&#10;walled garden, fell into, rather than found, a fortunate ditch, and&#10;lay there, scarce daring to whisper to each other until the stars were&#10;out.&#10;&#10;I suppose it was nearly eleven o'clock before we gathered courage&#10;to start again, no longer venturing into the road, but sneaking along&#10;hedgerows and through plantations, and watching keenly through the&#10;darkness, he on the right and I on the left, for the Martians, who&#10;seemed to be all about us.  In one place we blundered upon a scorched&#10;and blackened area, now cooling and ashen, and a number of scattered&#10;dead bodies of men, burned horribly about the heads and trunks but&#10;with their legs and boots mostly intact; and of dead horses, fifty&#10;feet, perhaps, behind a line of four ripped guns and smashed gun&#10;carriages.&#10;&#10;Sheen, it seemed, had escaped destruction, but the place was silent&#10;and deserted.  Here we happened on no dead, though the night was too&#10;dark for us to see into the side roads of the place.  In Sheen my&#10;companion suddenly complained of faintness and thirst, and we decided&#10;to try one of the houses.&#10;&#10;The first house we entered, after a little difficulty with the&#10;window, was a small semi-detached villa, and I found nothing eatable&#10;left in the place but some mouldy cheese.  There was, however, water&#10;to drink; and I took a hatchet, which promised to be useful in our&#10;next house-breaking.&#10;&#10;We then crossed to a place where the road turns towards Mortlake.&#10;Here there stood a white house within a walled garden, and in the&#10;pantry of this domicile we found a store of food--two loaves of bread&#10;in a pan, an uncooked steak, and the half of a ham.  I give this&#10;catalogue so precisely because, as it happened, we were destined to&#10;subsist upon this store for the next fortnight.  Bottled beer stood&#10;under a shelf, and there were two bags of haricot beans and some limp&#10;lettuces.  This pantry opened into a kind of wash-up kitchen, and in&#10;this was firewood; there was also a cupboard, in which we found nearly&#10;a dozen of burgundy, tinned soups and salmon, and two tins of&#10;biscuits.&#10;&#10;We sat in the adjacent kitchen in the dark--for we dared not strike&#10;a light--and ate bread and ham, and drank beer out of the same bottle.&#10;The curate, who was still timorous and restless, was now, oddly&#10;enough, for pushing on, and I was urging him to keep up his strength&#10;by eating when the thing happened that was to imprison us.&#10;&#10;&quot;It can't be midnight yet,&quot; I said, and then came a blinding glare&#10;of vivid green light.  Everything in the kitchen leaped out, clearly&#10;visible in green and black, and vanished again.  And then followed such&#10;a concussion as I have never heard before or since.  So close on the&#10;heels of this as to seem instantaneous came a thud behind me, a clash&#10;of glass, a crash and rattle of falling masonry all about us, and the&#10;plaster of the ceiling came down upon us, smashing into a multitude of&#10;fragments upon our heads.  I was knocked headlong across the floor&#10;against the oven handle and stunned.  I was insensible for a long&#10;time, the curate told me, and when I came to we were in darkness&#10;again, and he, with a face wet, as I found afterwards, with blood from&#10;a cut forehead, was dabbing water over me.&#10;&#10;For some time I could not recollect what had happened.  Then things&#10;came to me slowly.  A bruise on my temple asserted itself.&#10;&#10;&quot;Are you better?&quot; asked the curate in a whisper.&#10;&#10;At last I answered him.  I sat up.&#10;&#10;&quot;Don't move,&quot; he said.  &quot;The floor is covered with smashed crockery&#10;from the dresser.  You can't possibly move without making a noise, and&#10;I fancy _they_ are outside.&quot;&#10;&#10;We both sat quite silent, so that we could scarcely hear each other&#10;breathing.  Everything seemed deadly still, but once something near&#10;us, some plaster or broken brickwork, slid down with a rumbling sound.&#10;Outside and very near was an intermittent, metallic rattle.&#10;&#10;&quot;That!&quot; said the curate, when presently it happened again.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; I said.  &quot;But what is it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A Martian!&quot; said the curate.&#10;&#10;I listened again.&#10;&#10;&quot;It was not like the Heat-Ray,&quot; I said, and for a time I was&#10;inclined to think one of the great fighting-machines had stumbled&#10;against the house, as I had seen one stumble against the tower of&#10;Shepperton Church.&#10;&#10;Our situation was so strange and incomprehensible that for three or&#10;four hours, until the dawn came, we scarcely moved.  And then the light&#10;filtered in, not through the window, which remained black, but through&#10;a triangular aperture between a beam and a heap of broken bricks in&#10;the wall behind us.  The interior of the kitchen we now saw greyly for&#10;the first time.&#10;&#10;The window had been burst in by a mass of garden mould, which&#10;flowed over the table upon which we had been sitting and lay about our&#10;feet.  Outside, the soil was banked high against the house.  At the&#10;top of the window frame we could see an uprooted drainpipe.  The floor&#10;was littered with smashed hardware; the end of the kitchen towards the&#10;house was broken into, and since the daylight shone in there, it was&#10;evident the greater part of the house had collapsed.  Contrasting&#10;vividly with this ruin was the neat dresser, stained in the fashion,&#10;pale green, and with a number of copper and tin vessels below it, the&#10;wallpaper imitating blue and white tiles, and a couple of coloured&#10;supplements fluttering from the walls above the kitchen range.&#10;&#10;As the dawn grew clearer, we saw through the gap in the wall the&#10;body of a Martian, standing sentinel, I suppose, over the still&#10;glowing cylinder.  At the sight of that we crawled as circumspectly as&#10;possible out of the twilight of the kitchen into the darkness of the&#10;scullery.&#10;&#10;Abruptly the right interpretation dawned upon my mind.&#10;&#10;&quot;The fifth cylinder,&quot; I whispered, &quot;the fifth shot from Mars, has&#10;struck this house and buried us under the ruins!&quot;&#10;&#10;For a time the curate was silent, and then he whispered:&#10;&#10;&quot;God have mercy upon us!&quot;&#10;&#10;I heard him presently whimpering to himself.&#10;&#10;Save for that sound we lay quite still in the scullery; I for my&#10;part scarce dared breathe, and sat with my eyes fixed on the faint&#10;light of the kitchen door.  I could just see the curate's face, a dim,&#10;oval shape, and his collar and cuffs.  Outside there began a metallic&#10;hammering, then a violent hooting, and then again, after a quiet&#10;interval, a hissing like the hissing of an engine.  These noises, for&#10;the most part problematical, continued intermittently, and seemed if&#10;anything to increase in number as time wore on.  Presently a measured&#10;thudding and a vibration that made everything about us quiver and the&#10;vessels in the pantry ring and shift, began and continued.  Once the&#10;light was eclipsed, and the ghostly kitchen doorway became absolutely&#10;dark.  For many hours we must have crouched there, silent and&#10;shivering, until our tired attention failed. . . .&#10;&#10;At last I found myself awake and very hungry.  I am inclined to&#10;believe we must have spent the greater portion of a day before that&#10;awakening.  My hunger was at a stride so insistent that it moved me to&#10;action.  I told the curate I was going to seek food, and felt my way&#10;towards the pantry.  He made me no answer, but so soon as I began&#10;eating the faint noise I made stirred him up and I heard him crawling&#10;after me.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER TWO&#10;&#10;WHAT WE SAW FROM THE RUINED HOUSE&#10;&#10;&#10;After eating we crept back to the scullery, and there I must have&#10;dozed again, for when presently I looked round I was alone.  The&#10;thudding vibration continued with wearisome persistence.  I whispered&#10;for the curate several times, and at last felt my way to the door of&#10;the kitchen.  It was still daylight, and I perceived him across the&#10;room, lying against the triangular hole that looked out upon the&#10;Martians.  His shoulders were hunched, so that his head was hidden&#10;from me.&#10;&#10;I could hear a number of noises almost like those in an engine&#10;shed; and the place rocked with that beating thud.  Through the&#10;aperture in the wall I could see the top of a tree touched with gold&#10;and the warm blue of a tranquil evening sky.  For a minute or so I&#10;remained watching the curate, and then I advanced, crouching and&#10;stepping with extreme care amid the broken crockery that littered the&#10;floor.&#10;&#10;I touched the curate's leg, and he started so violently that a mass&#10;of plaster went sliding down outside and fell with a loud impact.  I&#10;gripped his arm, fearing he might cry out, and for a long time we&#10;crouched motionless.  Then I turned to see how much of our rampart&#10;remained.  The detachment of the plaster had left a vertical slit open&#10;in the debris, and by raising myself cautiously across a beam I was&#10;able to see out of this gap into what had been overnight a quiet&#10;suburban roadway.  Vast, indeed, was the change that we beheld.&#10;&#10;The fifth cylinder must have fallen right into the midst of the&#10;house we had first visited.  The building had vanished, completely&#10;smashed, pulverised, and dispersed by the blow.  The cylinder lay now&#10;far beneath the original foundations--deep in a hole, already vastly&#10;larger than the pit I had looked into at Woking.  The earth all round&#10;it had splashed under that tremendous impact--&quot;splashed&quot; is the only&#10;word--and lay in heaped piles that hid the masses of the adjacent&#10;houses.  It had behaved exactly like mud under the violent blow of a&#10;hammer.  Our house had collapsed backward; the front portion, even on&#10;the ground floor, had been destroyed completely; by a chance the&#10;kitchen and scullery had escaped, and stood buried now under soil and&#10;ruins, closed in by tons of earth on every side save towards the&#10;cylinder.  Over that aspect we hung now on the very edge of the great&#10;circular pit the Martians were engaged in making.  The heavy beating&#10;sound was evidently just behind us, and ever and again a bright green&#10;vapour drove up like a veil across our peephole.&#10;&#10;The cylinder was already opened in the centre of the pit, and on&#10;the farther edge of the pit, amid the smashed and gravel-heaped&#10;shrubbery, one of the great fighting-machines, deserted by its&#10;occupant, stood stiff and tall against the evening sky.  At first I&#10;scarcely noticed the pit and the cylinder, although it has been&#10;convenient to describe them first, on account of the extraordinary&#10;glittering mechanism I saw busy in the excavation, and on account of&#10;the strange creatures that were crawling slowly and painfully across&#10;the heaped mould near it.&#10;&#10;The mechanism it certainly was that held my attention first.  It&#10;was one of those complicated fabrics that have since been called&#10;handling-machines, and the study of which has already given such an&#10;enormous impetus to terrestrial invention.  As it dawned upon me&#10;first, it presented a sort of metallic spider with five jointed,&#10;agile legs, and with an extraordinary number of jointed levers, bars,&#10;and reaching and clutching tentacles about its body.  Most of its&#10;arms were retracted, but with three long tentacles it was fishing&#10;out a number of rods, plates, and bars which lined the covering and&#10;apparently strengthened the walls of the cylinder.  These, as it&#10;extracted them, were lifted out and deposited upon a level surface&#10;of earth behind it.&#10;&#10;Its motion was so swift, complex, and perfect that at first I did&#10;not see it as a machine, in spite of its metallic glitter.  The&#10;fighting-machines were coordinated and animated to an extraordinary&#10;pitch, but nothing to compare with this.  People who have never seen&#10;these structures, and have only the ill-imagined efforts of artists or&#10;the imperfect descriptions of such eye-witnesses as myself to go upon,&#10;scarcely realise that living quality.&#10;&#10;I recall particularly the illustration of one of the first&#10;pamphlets to give a consecutive account of the war.  The artist had&#10;evidently made a hasty study of one of the fighting-machines, and&#10;there his knowledge ended.  He presented them as tilted, stiff&#10;tripods, without either flexibility or subtlety, and with an&#10;altogether misleading monotony of effect.  The pamphlet containing&#10;these renderings had a considerable vogue, and I mention them here&#10;simply to warn the reader against the impression they may have&#10;created.  They were no more like the Martians I saw in action than a&#10;Dutch doll is like a human being.  To my mind, the pamphlet would have&#10;been much better without them.&#10;&#10;At first, I say, the handling-machine did not impress me as a&#10;machine, but as a crablike creature with a glittering integument, the&#10;controlling Martian whose delicate tentacles actuated its movements&#10;seeming to be simply the equivalent of the crab's cerebral portion.&#10;But then I perceived the resemblance of its grey-brown, shiny,&#10;leathery integument to that of the other sprawling bodies beyond, and&#10;the true nature of this dexterous workman dawned upon me.  With that&#10;realisation my interest shifted to those other creatures, the real&#10;Martians.  Already I had had a transient impression of these, and the&#10;first nausea no longer obscured my observation.  Moreover, I was&#10;concealed and motionless, and under no urgency of action.&#10;&#10;They were, I now saw, the most unearthly creatures it is possible&#10;to conceive.  They were huge round bodies--or, rather, heads--about&#10;four feet in diameter, each body having in front of it a face.  This&#10;face had no nostrils--indeed, the Martians do not seem to have had any&#10;sense of smell, but it had a pair of very large dark-coloured eyes,&#10;and just beneath this a kind of fleshy beak.  In the back of this head&#10;or body--I scarcely know how to speak of it--was the single tight&#10;tympanic surface, since known to be anatomically an ear, though it&#10;must have been almost useless in our dense air.  In a group round the&#10;mouth were sixteen slender, almost whiplike tentacles, arranged in two&#10;bunches of eight each.  These bunches have since been named rather&#10;aptly, by that distinguished anatomist, Professor Howes, the _hands_.&#10;Even as I saw these Martians for the first time they seemed to be&#10;endeavouring to raise themselves on these hands, but of course, with&#10;the increased weight of terrestrial conditions, this was impossible.&#10;There is reason to suppose that on Mars they may have progressed upon&#10;them with some facility.&#10;&#10;The internal anatomy, I may remark here, as dissection has since&#10;shown, was almost equally simple.  The greater part of the structure&#10;was the brain, sending enormous nerves to the eyes, ear, and tactile&#10;tentacles.  Besides this were the bulky lungs, into which the mouth&#10;opened, and the heart and its vessels.  The pulmonary distress caused&#10;by the denser atmosphere and greater gravitational attraction was only&#10;too evident in the convulsive movements of the outer skin.&#10;&#10;And this was the sum of the Martian organs.  Strange as it may seem&#10;to a human being, all the complex apparatus of digestion, which makes&#10;up the bulk of our bodies, did not exist in the Martians.  They were&#10;heads--merely heads.  Entrails they had none.  They did not eat, much&#10;less digest.  Instead, they took the fresh, living blood of other&#10;creatures, and _injected_ it into their own veins.  I have myself seen&#10;this being done, as I shall mention in its place.  But, squeamish as I&#10;may seem, I cannot bring myself to describe what I could not endure&#10;even to continue watching.  Let it suffice to say, blood obtained from&#10;a still living animal, in most cases from a human being, was run&#10;directly by means of a little pipette into the recipient canal. . . .&#10;&#10;The bare idea of this is no doubt horribly repulsive to us, but at&#10;the same time I think that we should remember how repulsive our&#10;carnivorous habits would seem to an intelligent rabbit.&#10;&#10;The physiological advantages of the practice of injection are&#10;undeniable, if one thinks of the tremendous waste of human time and&#10;energy occasioned by eating and the digestive process.  Our bodies are&#10;half made up of glands and tubes and organs, occupied in turning&#10;heterogeneous food into blood.  The digestive processes and their&#10;reaction upon the nervous system sap our strength and colour our&#10;minds.  Men go happy or miserable as they have healthy or unhealthy&#10;livers, or sound gastric glands.  But the Martians were lifted above&#10;all these organic fluctuations of mood and emotion.&#10;&#10;Their undeniable preference for men as their source of nourishment&#10;is partly explained by the nature of the remains of the victims they&#10;had brought with them as provisions from Mars.  These creatures, to&#10;judge from the shrivelled remains that have fallen into human hands,&#10;were bipeds with flimsy, silicious skeletons (almost like those of the&#10;silicious sponges) and feeble musculature, standing about six feet&#10;high and having round, erect heads, and large eyes in flinty sockets.&#10;Two or three of these seem to have been brought in each cylinder, and&#10;all were killed before earth was reached.  It was just as well for&#10;them, for the mere attempt to stand upright upon our planet would have&#10;broken every bone in their bodies.&#10;&#10;And while I am engaged in this description, I may add in this place&#10;certain further details which, although they were not all evident to&#10;us at the time, will enable the reader who is unacquainted with them&#10;to form a clearer picture of these offensive creatures.&#10;&#10;In three other points their physiology differed strangely from&#10;ours.  Their organisms did not sleep, any more than the heart of man&#10;sleeps.  Since they had no extensive muscular mechanism to recuperate,&#10;that periodical extinction was unknown to them.  They had little or&#10;no sense of fatigue, it would seem.  On earth they could never have&#10;moved without effort, yet even to the last they kept in action.  In&#10;twenty-four hours they did twenty-four hours of work, as even on earth&#10;is perhaps the case with the ants.&#10;&#10;In the next place, wonderful as it seems in a sexual world, the&#10;Martians were absolutely without sex, and therefore without any of the&#10;tumultuous emotions that arise from that difference among men.  A&#10;young Martian, there can now be no dispute, was really born upon earth&#10;during the war, and it was found attached to its parent, partially&#10;_budded_ off, just as young lilybulbs bud off, or like the young animals&#10;in the fresh-water polyp.&#10;&#10;In man, in all the higher terrestrial animals, such a method of&#10;increase has disappeared; but even on this earth it was certainly the&#10;primitive method.  Among the lower animals, up even to those first&#10;cousins of the vertebrated animals, the Tunicates, the two processes&#10;occur side by side, but finally the sexual method superseded its&#10;competitor altogether.  On Mars, however, just the reverse has&#10;apparently been the case.&#10;&#10;It is worthy of remark that a certain speculative writer of&#10;quasi-scientific repute, writing long before the Martian invasion, did&#10;forecast for man a final structure not unlike the actual Martian&#10;condition.  His prophecy, I remember, appeared in November or&#10;December, 1893, in a long-defunct publication, the _Pall Mall Budget_,&#10;and I recall a caricature of it in a pre-Martian periodical called&#10;_Punch_.  He pointed out--writing in a foolish, facetious tone--that the&#10;perfection of mechanical appliances must ultimately supersede limbs;&#10;the perfection of chemical devices, digestion; that such organs as&#10;hair, external nose, teeth, ears, and chin were no longer essential&#10;parts of the human being, and that the tendency of natural selection&#10;would lie in the direction of their steady diminution through the&#10;coming ages.  The brain alone remained a cardinal necessity.  Only one&#10;other part of the body had a strong case for survival, and that was&#10;the hand, &quot;teacher and agent of the brain.&quot;  While the rest of the&#10;body dwindled, the hands would grow larger.&#10;&#10;There is many a true word written in jest, and here in the Martians&#10;we have beyond dispute the actual accomplishment of such a suppression&#10;of the animal side of the organism by the intelligence.  To me it is&#10;quite credible that the Martians may be descended from beings not&#10;unlike ourselves, by a gradual development of brain and hands (the&#10;latter giving rise to the two bunches of delicate tentacles at last)&#10;at the expense of the rest of the body.  Without the body the brain&#10;would, of course, become a mere selfish intelligence, without any of&#10;the emotional substratum of the human being.&#10;&#10;The last salient point in which the systems of these creatures&#10;differed from ours was in what one might have thought a very trivial&#10;particular.  Micro-organisms, which cause so much disease and pain on&#10;earth, have either never appeared upon Mars or Martian sanitary&#10;science eliminated them ages ago.  A hundred diseases, all the fevers&#10;and contagions of human life, consumption, cancers, tumours and such&#10;morbidities, never enter the scheme of their life.  And speaking of&#10;the differences between the life on Mars and terrestrial life, I may&#10;allude here to the curious suggestions of the red weed.&#10;&#10;Apparently the vegetable kingdom in Mars, instead of having green&#10;for a dominant colour, is of a vivid blood-red tint.  At any rate, the&#10;seeds which the Martians (intentionally or accidentally) brought with&#10;them gave rise in all cases to red-coloured growths.  Only that known&#10;popularly as the red weed, however, gained any footing in competition&#10;with terrestrial forms.  The red creeper was quite a transitory&#10;growth, and few people have seen it growing.  For a time, however, the&#10;red weed grew with astonishing vigour and luxuriance.  It spread up&#10;the sides of the pit by the third or fourth day of our imprisonment,&#10;and its cactus-like branches formed a carmine fringe to the edges of&#10;our triangular window.  And afterwards I found it broadcast throughout&#10;the country, and especially wherever there was a stream of water.&#10;&#10;The Martians had what appears to have been an auditory organ, a&#10;single round drum at the back of the head-body, and eyes with a visual&#10;range not very different from ours except that, according to Philips,&#10;blue and violet were as black to them.  It is commonly supposed that&#10;they communicated by sounds and tentacular gesticulations; this is&#10;asserted, for instance, in the able but hastily compiled pamphlet&#10;(written evidently by someone not an eye-witness of Martian actions)&#10;to which I have already alluded, and which, so far, has been the chief&#10;source of information concerning them.  Now no surviving human being&#10;saw so much of the Martians in action as I did.  I take no credit to&#10;myself for an accident, but the fact is so.  And I assert that I&#10;watched them closely time after time, and that I have seen four, five,&#10;and (once) six of them sluggishly performing the most elaborately&#10;complicated operations together without either sound or gesture.  Their&#10;peculiar hooting invariably preceded feeding; it had no modulation,&#10;and was, I believe, in no sense a signal, but merely the expiration of&#10;air preparatory to the suctional operation.  I have a certain claim to&#10;at least an elementary knowledge of psychology, and in this matter I&#10;am convinced--as firmly as I am convinced of anything--that the&#10;Martians interchanged thoughts without any physical intermediation.&#10;And I have been convinced of this in spite of strong preconceptions.&#10;Before the Martian invasion, as an occasional reader here or there may&#10;remember, I had written with some little vehemence against the&#10;telepathic theory.&#10;&#10;The Martians wore no clothing.  Their conceptions of ornament and&#10;decorum were necessarily different from ours; and not only were they&#10;evidently much less sensible of changes of temperature than we are,&#10;but changes of pressure do not seem to have affected their health at&#10;all seriously.  Yet though they wore no clothing, it was in the other&#10;artificial additions to their bodily resources that their great&#10;superiority over man lay.  We men, with our bicycles and road-skates,&#10;our Lilienthal soaring-machines, our guns and sticks and so forth, are&#10;just in the beginning of the evolution that the Martians have worked&#10;out.  They have become practically mere brains, wearing different&#10;bodies according to their needs just as men wear suits of clothes and&#10;take a bicycle in a hurry or an umbrella in the wet.  And of their&#10;appliances, perhaps nothing is more wonderful to a man than the&#10;curious fact that what is the dominant feature of almost all human&#10;devices in mechanism is absent--the _wheel_ is absent; among all the&#10;things they brought to earth there is no trace or suggestion of their&#10;use of wheels.  One would have at least expected it in locomotion.  And&#10;in this connection it is curious to remark that even on this earth&#10;Nature has never hit upon the wheel, or has preferred other expedients&#10;to its development.  And not only did the Martians either not know of&#10;(which is incredible), or abstain from, the wheel, but in their&#10;apparatus singularly little use is made of the fixed pivot or&#10;relatively fixed pivot, with circular motions thereabout confined&#10;to one plane.  Almost all the joints of the machinery present a&#10;complicated system of sliding parts moving over small but beautifully&#10;curved friction bearings.  And while upon this matter of detail, it is&#10;remarkable that the long leverages of their machines are in most cases&#10;actuated by a sort of sham musculature of the disks in an elastic&#10;sheath; these disks become polarised and drawn closely and powerfully&#10;together when traversed by a current of electricity.  In this way the&#10;curious parallelism to animal motions, which was so striking and&#10;disturbing to the human beholder, was attained.  Such quasi-muscles&#10;abounded in the crablike handling-machine which, on my first peeping&#10;out of the slit, I watched unpacking the cylinder.  It seemed&#10;infinitely more alive than the actual Martians lying beyond it in the&#10;sunset light, panting, stirring ineffectual tentacles, and moving&#10;feebly after their vast journey across space.&#10;&#10;While I was still watching their sluggish motions in the sunlight,&#10;and noting each strange detail of their form, the curate reminded me&#10;of his presence by pulling violently at my arm.  I turned to a&#10;scowling face, and silent, eloquent lips.  He wanted the slit, which&#10;permitted only one of us to peep through; and so I had to forego&#10;watching them for a time while he enjoyed that privilege.&#10;&#10;When I looked again, the busy handling-machine had already put&#10;together several of the pieces of apparatus it had taken out of the&#10;cylinder into a shape having an unmistakable likeness to its own; and&#10;down on the left a busy little digging mechanism had come into view,&#10;emitting jets of green vapour and working its way round the pit,&#10;excavating and embanking in a methodical and discriminating manner.&#10;This it was which had caused the regular beating noise, and the&#10;rhythmic shocks that had kept our ruinous refuge quivering.  It piped&#10;and whistled as it worked.  So far as I could see, the thing was&#10;without a directing Martian at all.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER THREE&#10;&#10;THE DAYS OF IMPRISONMENT&#10;&#10;&#10;The arrival of a second fighting-machine drove us from our peephole&#10;into the scullery, for we feared that from his elevation the Martian&#10;might see down upon us behind our barrier.  At a later date we began&#10;to feel less in danger of their eyes, for to an eye in the dazzle of&#10;the sunlight outside our refuge must have been blank blackness, but at&#10;first the slightest suggestion of approach drove us into the scullery&#10;in heart-throbbing retreat.  Yet terrible as was the danger we&#10;incurred, the attraction of peeping was for both of us irresistible.&#10;And I recall now with a sort of wonder that, in spite of the infinite&#10;danger in which we were between starvation and a still more terrible&#10;death, we could yet struggle bitterly for that horrible privilege of&#10;sight.  We would race across the kitchen in a grotesque way between&#10;eagerness and the dread of making a noise, and strike each other, and&#10;thrust and kick, within a few inches of exposure.&#10;&#10;The fact is that we had absolutely incompatible dispositions and&#10;habits of thought and action, and our danger and isolation only&#10;accentuated the incompatibility.  At Halliford I had already come to&#10;hate the curate's trick of helpless exclamation, his stupid rigidity&#10;of mind.  His endless muttering monologue vitiated every effort I made&#10;to think out a line of action, and drove me at times, thus pent up and&#10;intensified, almost to the verge of craziness.  He was as lacking in&#10;restraint as a silly woman.  He would weep for hours together, and I&#10;verily believe that to the very end this spoiled child of life thought&#10;his weak tears in some way efficacious.  And I would sit in the&#10;darkness unable to keep my mind off him by reason of his&#10;importunities.  He ate more than I did, and it was in vain I pointed&#10;out that our only chance of life was to stop in the house until the&#10;Martians had done with their pit, that in that long patience a time&#10;might presently come when we should need food.  He ate and drank&#10;impulsively in heavy meals at long intervals.  He slept little.&#10;&#10;As the days wore on, his utter carelessness of any consideration so&#10;intensified our distress and danger that I had, much as I loathed&#10;doing it, to resort to threats, and at last to blows.  That brought him&#10;to reason for a time.  But he was one of those weak creatures, void of&#10;pride, timorous, anaemic, hateful souls, full of shifty cunning, who&#10;face neither God nor man, who face not even themselves.&#10;&#10;It is disagreeable for me to recall and write these things, but I&#10;set them down that my story may lack nothing.  Those who have escaped&#10;the dark and terrible aspects of life will find my brutality, my flash&#10;of rage in our final tragedy, easy enough to blame; for they know what&#10;is wrong as well as any, but not what is possible to tortured men.  But&#10;those who have been under the shadow, who have gone down at last to&#10;elemental things, will have a wider charity.&#10;&#10;And while within we fought out our dark, dim contest of whispers,&#10;snatched food and drink, and gripping hands and blows, without, in the&#10;pitiless sunlight of that terrible June, was the strange wonder, the&#10;unfamiliar routine of the Martians in the pit.  Let me return to those&#10;first new experiences of mine.  After a long time I ventured back to&#10;the peephole, to find that the new-comers had been reinforced by the&#10;occupants of no fewer than three of the fighting-machines.  These last&#10;had brought with them certain fresh appliances that stood in an&#10;orderly manner about the cylinder.  The second handling-machine was now&#10;completed, and was busied in serving one of the novel contrivances the&#10;big machine had brought.  This was a body resembling a milk can in its&#10;general form, above which oscillated a pear-shaped receptacle, and&#10;from which a stream of white powder flowed into a circular basin&#10;below.&#10;&#10;The oscillatory motion was imparted to this by one tentacle of the&#10;handling-machine.  With two spatulate hands the handling-machine was&#10;digging out and flinging masses of clay into the pear-shaped&#10;receptacle above, while with another arm it periodically opened a door&#10;and removed rusty and blackened clinkers from the middle part of the&#10;machine.  Another steely tentacle directed the powder from the basin&#10;along a ribbed channel towards some receiver that was hidden from me&#10;by the mound of bluish dust.  From this unseen receiver a little&#10;thread of green smoke rose vertically into the quiet air.  As I looked,&#10;the handling-machine, with a faint and musical clinking, extended,&#10;telescopic fashion, a tentacle that had been a moment before a mere&#10;blunt projection, until its end was hidden behind the mound of clay.&#10;In another second it had lifted a bar of white aluminium into sight,&#10;untarnished as yet, and shining dazzlingly, and deposited it in a&#10;growing stack of bars that stood at the side of the pit.  Between&#10;sunset and starlight this dexterous machine must have made more than a&#10;hundred such bars out of the crude clay, and the mound of bluish dust&#10;rose steadily until it topped the side of the pit.&#10;&#10;The contrast between the swift and complex movements of these&#10;contrivances and the inert panting clumsiness of their masters was&#10;acute, and for days I had to tell myself repeatedly that these latter&#10;were indeed the living of the two things.&#10;&#10;The curate had possession of the slit when the first men were&#10;brought to the pit.  I was sitting below, huddled up, listening with&#10;all my ears.  He made a sudden movement backward, and I, fearful that&#10;we were observed, crouched in a spasm of terror.  He came sliding down&#10;the rubbish and crept beside me in the darkness, inarticulate,&#10;gesticulating, and for a moment I shared his panic.  His gesture&#10;suggested a resignation of the slit, and after a little while my&#10;curiosity gave me courage, and I rose up, stepped across him, and&#10;clambered up to it.  At first I could see no reason for his frantic&#10;behaviour.  The twilight had now come, the stars were little and&#10;faint, but the pit was illuminated by the flickering green fire that&#10;came from the aluminium-making.  The whole picture was a flickering&#10;scheme of green gleams and shifting rusty black shadows, strangely&#10;trying to the eyes.  Over and through it all went the bats, heeding it&#10;not at all.  The sprawling Martians were no longer to be seen, the&#10;mound of blue-green powder had risen to cover them from sight, and a&#10;fighting-machine, with its legs contracted, crumpled, and abbreviated,&#10;stood across the corner of the pit.  And then, amid the clangour of&#10;the machinery, came a drifting suspicion of human voices, that I&#10;entertained at first only to dismiss.&#10;&#10;I crouched, watching this fighting-machine closely, satisfying&#10;myself now for the first time that the hood did indeed contain a&#10;Martian.  As the green flames lifted I could see the oily gleam of&#10;his integument and the brightness of his eyes.  And suddenly I heard&#10;a yell, and saw a long tentacle reaching over the shoulder of the&#10;machine to the little cage that hunched upon its back.  Then&#10;something--something struggling violently--was lifted high against the&#10;sky, a black, vague enigma against the starlight; and as this black&#10;object came down again, I saw by the green brightness that it was a&#10;man.  For an instant he was clearly visible.  He was a stout, ruddy,&#10;middle-aged man, well dressed; three days before, he must have been&#10;walking the world, a man of considerable consequence.  I could see his&#10;staring eyes and gleams of light on his studs and watch chain.  He&#10;vanished behind the mound, and for a moment there was silence.  And&#10;then began a shrieking and a sustained and cheerful hooting from the&#10;Martians.&#10;&#10;I slid down the rubbish, struggled to my feet, clapped my hands&#10;over my ears, and bolted into the scullery.  The curate, who had been&#10;crouching silently with his arms over his head, looked up as I passed,&#10;cried out quite loudly at my desertion of him, and came running after&#10;me.&#10;&#10;That night, as we lurked in the scullery, balanced between our&#10;horror and the terrible fascination this peeping had, although I felt&#10;an urgent need of action I tried in vain to conceive some plan of&#10;escape; but afterwards, during the second day, I was able to consider&#10;our position with great clearness.  The curate, I found, was quite&#10;incapable of discussion; this new and culminating atrocity had robbed&#10;him of all vestiges of reason or forethought.  Practically he had&#10;already sunk to the level of an animal.  But as the saying goes, I&#10;gripped myself with both hands.  It grew upon my mind, once I could&#10;face the facts, that terrible as our position was, there was as yet&#10;no justification for absolute despair.  Our chief chance lay in the&#10;possibility of the Martians making the pit nothing more than a&#10;temporary encampment.  Or even if they kept it permanently, they might&#10;not consider it necessary to guard it, and a chance of escape might be&#10;afforded us.  I also weighed very carefully the possibility of our&#10;digging a way out in a direction away from the pit, but the chances of&#10;our emerging within sight of some sentinel fighting-machine seemed at&#10;first too great.  And I should have had to do all the digging myself.&#10;The curate would certainly have failed me.&#10;&#10;It was on the third day, if my memory serves me right, that I saw&#10;the lad killed.  It was the only occasion on which I actually saw the&#10;Martians feed.  After that experience I avoided the hole in the wall&#10;for the better part of a day.  I went into the scullery, removed the&#10;door, and spent some hours digging with my hatchet as silently as&#10;possible; but when I had made a hole about a couple of feet deep the&#10;loose earth collapsed noisily, and I did not dare continue.  I lost&#10;heart, and lay down on the scullery floor for a long time, having no&#10;spirit even to move.  And after that I abandoned altogether the idea&#10;of escaping by excavation.&#10;&#10;It says much for the impression the Martians had made upon me that&#10;at first I entertained little or no hope of our escape being brought&#10;about by their overthrow through any human effort.  But on the fourth&#10;or fifth night I heard a sound like heavy guns.&#10;&#10;It was very late in the night, and the moon was shining brightly.&#10;The Martians had taken away the excavating-machine, and, save for a&#10;fighting-machine that stood in the remoter bank of the pit and a&#10;handling-machine that was buried out of my sight in a corner of the&#10;pit immediately beneath my peephole, the place was deserted by them.&#10;Except for the pale glow from the handling-machine and the bars and&#10;patches of white moonlight the pit was in darkness, and, except for&#10;the clinking of the handling-machine, quite still.  That night was a&#10;beautiful serenity; save for one planet, the moon seemed to have the&#10;sky to herself.  I heard a dog howling, and that familiar sound it was&#10;that made me listen.  Then I heard quite distinctly a booming exactly&#10;like the sound of great guns.  Six distinct reports I counted, and&#10;after a long interval six again.  And that was all.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER FOUR&#10;&#10;THE DEATH OF THE CURATE&#10;&#10;&#10;It was on the sixth day of our imprisonment that I peeped for the&#10;last time, and presently found myself alone.  Instead of keeping close&#10;to me and trying to oust me from the slit, the curate had gone back&#10;into the scullery.  I was struck by a sudden thought.  I went back&#10;quickly and quietly into the scullery.  In the darkness I heard the&#10;curate drinking.  I snatched in the darkness, and my fingers caught a&#10;bottle of burgundy.&#10;&#10;For a few minutes there was a tussle.  The bottle struck the floor&#10;and broke, and I desisted and rose.  We stood panting and threatening&#10;each other.  In the end I planted myself between him and the food, and&#10;told him of my determination to begin a discipline.  I divided the&#10;food in the pantry, into rations to last us ten days.  I would not let&#10;him eat any more that day.  In the afternoon he made a feeble effort&#10;to get at the food.  I had been dozing, but in an instant I was awake.&#10;All day and all night we sat face to face, I weary but resolute, and&#10;he weeping and complaining of his immediate hunger.  It was, I know, a&#10;night and a day, but to me it seemed--it seems now--an interminable&#10;length of time.&#10;&#10;And so our widened incompatibility ended at last in open conflict.&#10;For two vast days we struggled in undertones and wrestling contests.&#10;There were times when I beat and kicked him madly, times when I&#10;cajoled and persuaded him, and once I tried to bribe him with the last&#10;bottle of burgundy, for there was a rain-water pump from which I could&#10;get water.  But neither force nor kindness availed; he was indeed&#10;beyond reason.  He would neither desist from his attacks on the food&#10;nor from his noisy babbling to himself.  The rudimentary precautions&#10;to keep our imprisonment endurable he would not observe.  Slowly I&#10;began to realise the complete overthrow of his intelligence, to&#10;perceive that my sole companion in this close and sickly darkness was&#10;a man insane.&#10;&#10;From certain vague memories I am inclined to think my own mind&#10;wandered at times.  I had strange and hideous dreams whenever I slept.&#10;It sounds paradoxical, but I am inclined to think that the weakness&#10;and insanity of the curate warned me, braced me, and kept me a sane&#10;man.&#10;&#10;On the eighth day he began to talk aloud instead of whispering, and&#10;nothing I could do would moderate his speech.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is just, O God!&quot; he would say, over and over again. &quot;It is&#10;just.  On me and mine be the punishment laid.  We have sinned, we have&#10;fallen short.  There was poverty, sorrow; the poor were trodden in&#10;the dust, and I held my peace.  I preached acceptable folly--my God,&#10;what folly!--when I should have stood up, though I died for it, and&#10;called upon them to repent--repent! . . .  Oppressors of the poor and&#10;needy . . . !  The wine press of God!&quot;&#10;&#10;Then he would suddenly revert to the matter of the food I withheld&#10;from him, praying, begging, weeping, at last threatening.  He began to&#10;raise his voice--I prayed him not to.  He perceived a hold on me--he&#10;threatened he would shout and bring the Martians upon us.  For a time&#10;that scared me; but any concession would have shortened our chance of&#10;escape beyond estimating.  I defied him, although I felt no assurance&#10;that he might not do this thing.  But that day, at any rate, he did&#10;not.  He talked with his voice rising slowly, through the greater part&#10;of the eighth and ninth days--threats, entreaties, mingled with a&#10;torrent of half-sane and always frothy repentance for his vacant sham&#10;of God's service, such as made me pity him.  Then he slept awhile, and&#10;began again with renewed strength, so loudly that I must needs make&#10;him desist.&#10;&#10;&quot;Be still!&quot; I implored.&#10;&#10;He rose to his knees, for he had been sitting in the darkness near&#10;the copper.&#10;&#10;&quot;I have been still too long,&quot; he said, in a tone that must have&#10;reached the pit, &quot;and now I must bear my witness.  Woe unto this&#10;unfaithful city!  Woe!  Woe!  Woe!  Woe!  Woe! To the inhabitants of&#10;the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet----&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Shut up!&quot; I said, rising to my feet, and in a terror lest the&#10;Martians should hear us.  &quot;For God's sake----&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Nay,&quot; shouted the curate, at the top of his voice, standing&#10;likewise and extending his arms.  &quot;Speak!  The word of the Lord is&#10;upon me!&quot;&#10;&#10;In three strides he was at the door leading into the kitchen.&#10;&#10;&quot;I must bear my witness!  I go!  It has already been too long&#10;delayed.&quot;&#10;&#10;I put out my hand and felt the meat chopper hanging to the wall.&#10;In a flash I was after him.  I was fierce with fear.  Before he was&#10;halfway across the kitchen I had overtaken him.  With one last touch&#10;of humanity I turned the blade back and struck him with the butt.  He&#10;went headlong forward and lay stretched on the ground.  I stumbled&#10;over him and stood panting.  He lay still.&#10;&#10;Suddenly I heard a noise without, the run and smash of slipping&#10;plaster, and the triangular aperture in the wall was darkened.  I&#10;looked up and saw the lower surface of a handling-machine coming&#10;slowly across the hole.  One of its gripping limbs curled amid the&#10;debris; another limb appeared, feeling its way over the fallen beams.&#10;I stood petrified, staring.  Then I saw through a sort of glass plate&#10;near the edge of the body the face, as we may call it, and the large&#10;dark eyes of a Martian, peering, and then a long metallic snake of&#10;tentacle came feeling slowly through the hole.&#10;&#10;I turned by an effort, stumbled over the curate, and stopped at the&#10;scullery door.  The tentacle was now some way, two yards or more, in&#10;the room, and twisting and turning, with queer sudden movements, this&#10;way and that.  For a while I stood fascinated by that slow, fitful&#10;advance.  Then, with a faint, hoarse cry, I forced myself across the&#10;scullery.  I trembled violently; I could scarcely stand upright.  I&#10;opened the door of the coal cellar, and stood there in the darkness&#10;staring at the faintly lit doorway into the kitchen, and listening.&#10;Had the Martian seen me?  What was it doing now?&#10;&#10;Something was moving to and fro there, very quietly; every now and&#10;then it tapped against the wall, or started on its movements with a&#10;faint metallic ringing, like the movements of keys on a split-ring.&#10;Then a heavy body--I knew too well what--was dragged across the floor&#10;of the kitchen towards the opening.  Irresistibly attracted, I crept&#10;to the door and peeped into the kitchen.  In the triangle of bright&#10;outer sunlight I saw the Martian, in its Briareus of a handling-machine,&#10;scrutinizing the curate's head.  I thought at once that it would infer&#10;my presence from the mark of the blow I had given him.&#10;&#10;I crept back to the coal cellar, shut the door, and began to cover&#10;myself up as much as I could, and as noiselessly as possible in the&#10;darkness, among the firewood and coal therein.  Every now and then I&#10;paused, rigid, to hear if the Martian had thrust its tentacles through&#10;the opening again.&#10;&#10;Then the faint metallic jingle returned.  I traced it slowly&#10;feeling over the kitchen.  Presently I heard it nearer--in the&#10;scullery, as I judged.  I thought that its length might be&#10;insufficient to reach me.  I prayed copiously.  It passed, scraping&#10;faintly across the cellar door.  An age of almost intolerable suspense&#10;intervened; then I heard it fumbling at the latch! It had found the&#10;door!  The Martians understood doors!&#10;&#10;It worried at the catch for a minute, perhaps, and then the door&#10;opened.&#10;&#10;In the darkness I could just see the thing--like an elephant's&#10;trunk more than anything else--waving towards me and touching and&#10;examining the wall, coals, wood and ceiling.  It was like a black worm&#10;swaying its blind head to and fro.&#10;&#10;Once, even, it touched the heel of my boot.  I was on the verge of&#10;screaming; I bit my hand.  For a time the tentacle was silent.  I&#10;could have fancied it had been withdrawn.  Presently, with an abrupt&#10;click, it gripped something--I thought it had me!--and seemed to go&#10;out of the cellar again.  For a minute I was not sure.  Apparently it&#10;had taken a lump of coal to examine.&#10;&#10;I seized the opportunity of slightly shifting my position, which&#10;had become cramped, and then listened.  I whispered passionate prayers&#10;for safety.&#10;&#10;Then I heard the slow, deliberate sound creeping towards me again.&#10;Slowly, slowly it drew near, scratching against the walls and tapping&#10;the furniture.&#10;&#10;While I was still doubtful, it rapped smartly against the cellar&#10;door and closed it.  I heard it go into the pantry, and the biscuit-tins&#10;rattled and a bottle smashed, and then came a heavy bump against&#10;the cellar door.  Then silence that passed into an infinity of&#10;suspense.&#10;&#10;Had it gone?&#10;&#10;At last I decided that it had.&#10;&#10;It came into the scullery no more; but I lay all the tenth day in&#10;the close darkness, buried among coals and firewood, not daring even&#10;to crawl out for the drink for which I craved.  It was the eleventh day&#10;before I ventured so far from my security.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER FIVE&#10;&#10;THE STILLNESS&#10;&#10;&#10;My first act before I went into the pantry was to fasten the door&#10;between the kitchen and the scullery.  But the pantry was empty; every&#10;scrap of food had gone.  Apparently, the Martian had taken it all on&#10;the previous day.  At that discovery I despaired for the first time.  I&#10;took no food, or no drink either, on the eleventh or the twelfth day.&#10;&#10;At first my mouth and throat were parched, and my strength ebbed&#10;sensibly.  I sat about in the darkness of the scullery, in a state of&#10;despondent wretchedness.  My mind ran on eating.  I thought I had&#10;become deaf, for the noises of movement I had been accustomed to hear&#10;from the pit had ceased absolutely.  I did not feel strong enough to&#10;crawl noiselessly to the peephole, or I would have gone there.&#10;&#10;On the twelfth day my throat was so painful that, taking the chance&#10;of alarming the Martians, I attacked the creaking rain-water pump that&#10;stood by the sink, and got a couple of glassfuls of blackened and&#10;tainted rain water.  I was greatly refreshed by this, and emboldened&#10;by the fact that no enquiring tentacle followed the noise of my&#10;pumping.&#10;&#10;During these days, in a rambling, inconclusive way, I thought much&#10;of the curate and of the manner of his death.&#10;&#10;On the thirteenth day I drank some more water, and dozed and&#10;thought disjointedly of eating and of vague impossible plans of&#10;escape.  Whenever I dozed I dreamt of horrible phantasms, of the death&#10;of the curate, or of sumptuous dinners; but, asleep or awake, I felt a&#10;keen pain that urged me to drink again and again.  The light that came&#10;into the scullery was no longer grey, but red.  To my disordered&#10;imagination it seemed the colour of blood.&#10;&#10;On the fourteenth day I went into the kitchen, and I was surprised&#10;to find that the fronds of the red weed had grown right across&#10;the hole in the wall, turning the half-light of the place into a&#10;crimson-coloured obscurity.&#10;&#10;It was early on the fifteenth day that I heard a curious, familiar&#10;sequence of sounds in the kitchen, and, listening, identified it as&#10;the snuffing and scratching of a dog.  Going into the kitchen, I saw a&#10;dog's nose peering in through a break among the ruddy fronds.  This&#10;greatly surprised me.  At the scent of me he barked shortly.&#10;&#10;I thought if I could induce him to come into the place quietly I&#10;should be able, perhaps, to kill and eat him; and in any case, it&#10;would be advisable to kill him, lest his actions attracted the&#10;attention of the Martians.&#10;&#10;I crept forward, saying &quot;Good dog!&quot; very softly; but he suddenly&#10;withdrew his head and disappeared.&#10;&#10;I listened--I was not deaf--but certainly the pit was still.  I&#10;heard a sound like the flutter of a bird's wings, and a hoarse&#10;croaking, but that was all.&#10;&#10;For a long while I lay close to the peephole, but not daring to&#10;move aside the red plants that obscured it.  Once or twice I heard a&#10;faint pitter-patter like the feet of the dog going hither and thither&#10;on the sand far below me, and there were more birdlike sounds, but&#10;that was all.  At length, encouraged by the silence, I looked out.&#10;&#10;Except in the corner, where a multitude of crows hopped and fought&#10;over the skeletons of the dead the Martians had consumed, there was&#10;not a living thing in the pit.&#10;&#10;I stared about me, scarcely believing my eyes.  All the machinery&#10;had gone.  Save for the big mound of greyish-blue powder in one&#10;corner, certain bars of aluminium in another, the black birds, and the&#10;skeletons of the killed, the place was merely an empty circular pit in&#10;the sand.&#10;&#10;Slowly I thrust myself out through the red weed, and stood upon the&#10;mound of rubble.  I could see in any direction save behind me, to the&#10;north, and neither Martians nor sign of Martians were to be seen.  The&#10;pit dropped sheerly from my feet, but a little way along the rubbish&#10;afforded a practicable slope to the summit of the ruins.  My chance of&#10;escape had come.  I began to tremble.&#10;&#10;I hesitated for some time, and then, in a gust of desperate&#10;resolution, and with a heart that throbbed violently, I scrambled to&#10;the top of the mound in which I had been buried so long.&#10;&#10;I looked about again.  To the northward, too, no Martian was&#10;visible.&#10;&#10;When I had last seen this part of Sheen in the daylight it had been&#10;a straggling street of comfortable white and red houses, interspersed&#10;with abundant shady trees.  Now I stood on a mound of smashed&#10;brickwork, clay, and gravel, over which spread a multitude of red&#10;cactus-shaped plants, knee-high, without a solitary terrestrial growth&#10;to dispute their footing.  The trees near me were dead and brown, but&#10;further a network of red thread scaled the still living stems.&#10;&#10;The neighbouring houses had all been wrecked, but none had been&#10;burned; their walls stood, sometimes to the second story, with smashed&#10;windows and shattered doors.  The red weed grew tumultuously in their&#10;roofless rooms.  Below me was the great pit, with the crows struggling&#10;for its refuse.  A number of other birds hopped about among the ruins.&#10;Far away I saw a gaunt cat slink crouchingly along a wall, but traces&#10;of men there were none.&#10;&#10;The day seemed, by contrast with my recent confinement, dazzlingly&#10;bright, the sky a glowing blue.  A gentle breeze kept the red weed&#10;that covered every scrap of unoccupied ground gently swaying.  And oh!&#10;the sweetness of the air!&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER SIX&#10;&#10;THE WORK OF FIFTEEN DAYS&#10;&#10;&#10;For some time I stood tottering on the mound regardless of my&#10;safety.  Within that noisome den from which I had emerged I had&#10;thought with a narrow intensity only of our immediate security.  I had&#10;not realised what had been happening to the world, had not anticipated&#10;this startling vision of unfamiliar things.  I had expected to see&#10;Sheen in ruins--I found about me the landscape, weird and lurid, of&#10;another planet.&#10;&#10;For that moment I touched an emotion beyond the common range of&#10;men, yet one that the poor brutes we dominate know only too well.  I&#10;felt as a rabbit might feel returning to his burrow and suddenly&#10;confronted by the work of a dozen busy navvies digging the foundations&#10;of a house.  I felt the first inkling of a thing that presently grew&#10;quite clear in my mind, that oppressed me for many days, a sense of&#10;dethronement, a persuasion that I was no longer a master, but an&#10;animal among the animals, under the Martian heel.  With us it would be&#10;as with them, to lurk and watch, to run and hide; the fear and empire&#10;of man had passed away.&#10;&#10;But so soon as this strangeness had been realised it passed, and my&#10;dominant motive became the hunger of my long and dismal fast.  In the&#10;direction away from the pit I saw, beyond a red-covered wall, a patch&#10;of garden ground unburied.  This gave me a hint, and I went knee-deep,&#10;and sometimes neck-deep, in the red weed.  The density of the&#10;weed gave me a reassuring sense of hiding.  The wall was some six feet&#10;high, and when I attempted to clamber it I found I could not lift my&#10;feet to the crest.  So I went along by the side of it, and came to a&#10;corner and a rockwork that enabled me to get to the top, and tumble&#10;into the garden I coveted.  Here I found some young onions, a couple&#10;of gladiolus bulbs, and a quantity of immature carrots, all of which I&#10;secured, and, scrambling over a ruined wall, went on my way through&#10;scarlet and crimson trees towards Kew--it was like walking through an&#10;avenue of gigantic blood drops--possessed with two ideas: to get more&#10;food, and to limp, as soon and as far as my strength permitted, out of&#10;this accursed unearthly region of the pit.&#10;&#10;Some way farther, in a grassy place, was a group of mushrooms which&#10;also I devoured, and then I came upon a brown sheet of flowing shallow&#10;water, where meadows used to be.  These fragments of nourishment served&#10;only to whet my hunger.  At first I was surprised at this flood in a&#10;hot, dry summer, but afterwards I discovered that it was caused by the&#10;tropical exuberance of the red weed.  Directly this extraordinary&#10;growth encountered water it straightway became gigantic and of&#10;unparalleled fecundity.  Its seeds were simply poured down into the&#10;water of the Wey and Thames, and its swiftly growing and Titanic water&#10;fronds speedily choked both those rivers.&#10;&#10;At Putney, as I afterwards saw, the bridge was almost lost in a&#10;tangle of this weed, and at Richmond, too, the Thames water poured in&#10;a broad and shallow stream across the meadows of Hampton and&#10;Twickenham.  As the water spread the weed followed them, until the&#10;ruined villas of the Thames valley were for a time lost in this red&#10;swamp, whose margin I explored, and much of the desolation the&#10;Martians had caused was concealed.&#10;&#10;In the end the red weed succumbed almost as quickly as it had&#10;spread.  A cankering disease, due, it is believed, to the action of&#10;certain bacteria, presently seized upon it.  Now by the action of&#10;natural selection, all terrestrial plants have acquired a resisting&#10;power against bacterial diseases--they never succumb without a severe&#10;struggle, but the red weed rotted like a thing already dead.  The&#10;fronds became bleached, and then shrivelled and brittle.  They broke&#10;off at the least touch, and the waters that had stimulated their early&#10;growth carried their last vestiges out to sea.&#10;&#10;My first act on coming to this water was, of course, to slake my&#10;thirst.  I drank a great deal of it and, moved by an impulse, gnawed&#10;some fronds of red weed; but they were watery, and had a sickly,&#10;metallic taste.  I found the water was sufficiently shallow for me to&#10;wade securely, although the red weed impeded my feet a little; but the&#10;flood evidently got deeper towards the river, and I turned back to&#10;Mortlake.  I managed to make out the road by means of occasional ruins&#10;of its villas and fences and lamps, and so presently I got out of this&#10;spate and made my way to the hill going up towards Roehampton and came&#10;out on Putney Common.&#10;&#10;Here the scenery changed from the strange and unfamiliar to the&#10;wreckage of the familiar: patches of ground exhibited the devastation&#10;of a cyclone, and in a few score yards I would come upon perfectly&#10;undisturbed spaces, houses with their blinds trimly drawn and doors&#10;closed, as if they had been left for a day by the owners, or as if&#10;their inhabitants slept within.  The red weed was less abundant; the&#10;tall trees along the lane were free from the red creeper.  I hunted&#10;for food among the trees, finding nothing, and I also raided a couple&#10;of silent houses, but they had already been broken into and ransacked.&#10;I rested for the remainder of the daylight in a shrubbery, being, in&#10;my enfeebled condition, too fatigued to push on.&#10;&#10;All this time I saw no human beings, and no signs of the Martians.&#10;I encountered a couple of hungry-looking dogs, but both hurried&#10;circuitously away from the advances I made them.  Near Roehampton I&#10;had seen two human skeletons--not bodies, but skeletons, picked&#10;clean--and in the wood by me I found the crushed and scattered bones&#10;of several cats and rabbits and the skull of a sheep.  But though I&#10;gnawed parts of these in my mouth, there was nothing to be got from&#10;them.&#10;&#10;After sunset I struggled on along the road towards Putney, where I&#10;think the Heat-Ray must have been used for some reason.  And in the&#10;garden beyond Roehampton I got a quantity of immature potatoes,&#10;sufficient to stay my hunger.  From this garden one looked down upon&#10;Putney and the river.  The aspect of the place in the dusk was&#10;singularly desolate: blackened trees, blackened, desolate ruins, and&#10;down the hill the sheets of the flooded river, red-tinged with the&#10;weed.  And over all--silence.  It filled me with indescribable terror&#10;to think how swiftly that desolating change had come.&#10;&#10;For a time I believed that mankind had been swept out of existence,&#10;and that I stood there alone, the last man left alive.  Hard by the&#10;top of Putney Hill I came upon another skeleton, with the arms&#10;dislocated and removed several yards from the rest of the body.  As I&#10;proceeded I became more and more convinced that the extermination of&#10;mankind was, save for such stragglers as myself, already accomplished&#10;in this part of the world.  The Martians, I thought, had gone on and&#10;left the country desolated, seeking food elsewhere.  Perhaps even now&#10;they were destroying Berlin or Paris, or it might be they had gone&#10;northward.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER SEVEN&#10;&#10;THE MAN ON PUTNEY HILL&#10;&#10;&#10;I spent that night in the inn that stands at the top of Putney&#10;Hill, sleeping in a made bed for the first time since my flight to&#10;Leatherhead.  I will not tell the needless trouble I had breaking into&#10;that house--afterwards I found the front door was on the latch--nor&#10;how I ransacked every room for food, until just on the verge of&#10;despair, in what seemed to me to be a servant's bedroom, I found a&#10;rat-gnawed crust and two tins of pineapple.  The place had been&#10;already searched and emptied.  In the bar I afterwards found some&#10;biscuits and sandwiches that had been overlooked.  The latter I could&#10;not eat, they were too rotten, but the former not only stayed my&#10;hunger, but filled my pockets.  I lit no lamps, fearing some Martian&#10;might come beating that part of London for food in the night.  Before&#10;I went to bed I had an interval of restlessness, and prowled from&#10;window to window, peering out for some sign of these monsters.  I&#10;slept little.  As I lay in bed I found myself thinking consecutively--a&#10;thing I do not remember to have done since my last argument with the&#10;curate.  During all the intervening time my mental condition had been&#10;a hurrying succession of vague emotional states or a sort of stupid&#10;receptivity.  But in the night my brain, reinforced, I suppose, by the&#10;food I had eaten, grew clear again, and I thought.&#10;&#10;Three things struggled for possession of my mind: the killing of&#10;the curate, the whereabouts of the Martians, and the possible fate of&#10;my wife.  The former gave me no sensation of horror or remorse to&#10;recall; I saw it simply as a thing done, a memory infinitely&#10;disagreeable but quite without the quality of remorse.  I saw myself&#10;then as I see myself now, driven step by step towards that hasty blow,&#10;the creature of a sequence of accidents leading inevitably to that.  I&#10;felt no condemnation; yet the memory, static, unprogressive, haunted&#10;me.  In the silence of the night, with that sense of the nearness of&#10;God that sometimes comes into the stillness and the darkness, I stood&#10;my trial, my only trial, for that moment of wrath and fear.  I&#10;retraced every step of our conversation from the moment when I had&#10;found him crouching beside me, heedless of my thirst, and pointing to&#10;the fire and smoke that streamed up from the ruins of Weybridge.  We&#10;had been incapable of co-operation--grim chance had taken no heed of&#10;that.  Had I foreseen, I should have left him at Halliford.  But I did&#10;not foresee; and crime is to foresee and do.  And I set this down as I&#10;have set all this story down, as it was.  There were no witnesses--all&#10;these things I might have concealed.  But I set it down, and the&#10;reader must form his judgment as he will.&#10;&#10;And when, by an effort, I had set aside that picture of a prostrate&#10;body, I faced the problem of the Martians and the fate of my wife.  For&#10;the former I had no data; I could imagine a hundred things, and so,&#10;unhappily, I could for the latter.  And suddenly that night became&#10;terrible.  I found myself sitting up in bed, staring at the dark.  I&#10;found myself praying that the Heat-Ray might have suddenly and&#10;painlessly struck her out of being.  Since the night of my return from&#10;Leatherhead I had not prayed.  I had uttered prayers, fetish prayers,&#10;had prayed as heathens mutter charms when I was in extremity; but now&#10;I prayed indeed, pleading steadfastly and sanely, face to face with&#10;the darkness of God.  Strange night!  Strangest in this, that so soon&#10;as dawn had come, I, who had talked with God, crept out of the house&#10;like a rat leaving its hiding place--a creature scarcely larger, an&#10;inferior animal, a thing that for any passing whim of our masters&#10;might be hunted and killed.  Perhaps they also prayed confidently to&#10;God.  Surely, if we have learned nothing else, this war has taught us&#10;pity--pity for those witless souls that suffer our dominion.&#10;&#10;The morning was bright and fine, and the eastern sky glowed pink,&#10;and was fretted with little golden clouds.  In the road that runs from&#10;the top of Putney Hill to Wimbledon was a number of poor vestiges of&#10;the panic torrent that must have poured Londonward on the Sunday night&#10;after the fighting began.  There was a little two-wheeled cart&#10;inscribed with the name of Thomas Lobb, Greengrocer, New Malden, with&#10;a smashed wheel and an abandoned tin trunk; there was a straw hat&#10;trampled into the now hardened mud, and at the top of West Hill a lot&#10;of blood-stained glass about the overturned water trough.  My&#10;movements were languid, my plans of the vaguest.  I had an idea of&#10;going to Leatherhead, though I knew that there I had the poorest&#10;chance of finding my wife.  Certainly, unless death had overtaken them&#10;suddenly, my cousins and she would have fled thence; but it seemed to&#10;me I might find or learn there whither the Surrey people had fled.  I&#10;knew I wanted to find my wife, that my heart ached for her and the&#10;world of men, but I had no clear idea how the finding might be done.  I&#10;was also sharply aware now of my intense loneliness.  From the corner&#10;I went, under cover of a thicket of trees and bushes, to the edge of&#10;Wimbledon Common, stretching wide and far.&#10;&#10;That dark expanse was lit in patches by yellow gorse and broom;&#10;there was no red weed to be seen, and as I prowled, hesitating, on the&#10;verge of the open, the sun rose, flooding it all with light and&#10;vitality.  I came upon a busy swarm of little frogs in a swampy place&#10;among the trees.  I stopped to look at them, drawing a lesson from&#10;their stout resolve to live.  And presently, turning suddenly, with an&#10;odd feeling of being watched, I beheld something crouching amid a&#10;clump of bushes.  I stood regarding this.  I made a step towards it,&#10;and it rose up and became a man armed with a cutlass.  I approached&#10;him slowly.  He stood silent and motionless, regarding me.&#10;&#10;As I drew nearer I perceived he was dressed in clothes as dusty and&#10;filthy as my own; he looked, indeed, as though he had been dragged&#10;through a culvert.  Nearer, I distinguished the green slime of ditches&#10;mixing with the pale drab of dried clay and shiny, coaly patches.  His&#10;black hair fell over his eyes, and his face was dark and dirty and&#10;sunken, so that at first I did not recognise him.  There was a red cut&#10;across the lower part of his face.&#10;&#10;&quot;Stop!&quot; he cried, when I was within ten yards of him, and I&#10;stopped.  His voice was hoarse.  &quot;Where do you come from?&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;I thought, surveying him.&#10;&#10;&quot;I come from Mortlake,&quot; I said.  &quot;I was buried near the pit the&#10;Martians made about their cylinder.  I have worked my way out and&#10;escaped.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;There is no food about here,&quot; he said.  &quot;This is my country.  All&#10;this hill down to the river, and back to Clapham, and up to the edge&#10;of the common.  There is only food for one.  Which way are you going?&quot;&#10;&#10;I answered slowly.&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't know,&quot; I said.  &quot;I have been buried in the ruins of a&#10;house thirteen or fourteen days.  I don't know what has happened.&quot;&#10;&#10;He looked at me doubtfully, then started, and looked with a changed&#10;expression.&#10;&#10;&quot;I've no wish to stop about here,&quot; said I.  &quot;I think I shall go to&#10;Leatherhead, for my wife was there.&quot;&#10;&#10;He shot out a pointing finger.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is you,&quot; said he; &quot;the man from Woking.  And you weren't killed&#10;at Weybridge?&quot;&#10;&#10;I recognised him at the same moment.&#10;&#10;&quot;You are the artilleryman who came into my garden.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Good luck!&quot; he said.  &quot;We are lucky ones!  Fancy _you_!&quot;  He put out&#10;a hand, and I took it.  &quot;I crawled up a drain,&quot; he said. &quot;But they&#10;didn't kill everyone.  And after they went away I got off towards&#10;Walton across the fields.  But---- It's not sixteen days altogether--and&#10;your hair is grey.&quot;  He looked over his shoulder suddenly.  &quot;Only&#10;a rook,&quot; he said.  &quot;One gets to know that birds have shadows these&#10;days.  This is a bit open.  Let us crawl under those bushes and talk.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Have you seen any Martians?&quot; I said.  &quot;Since I crawled out----&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;They've gone away across London,&quot; he said.  &quot;I guess they've got a&#10;bigger camp there.  Of a night, all over there, Hampstead way, the sky&#10;is alive with their lights.  It's like a great city, and in the glare&#10;you can just see them moving.  By daylight you can't.  But nearer--I&#10;haven't seen them--&quot; (he counted on his fingers) &quot;five days.  Then I&#10;saw a couple across Hammersmith way carrying something big.  And the&#10;night before last&quot;--he stopped and spoke impressively--&quot;it was just a&#10;matter of lights, but it was something up in the air.  I believe&#10;they've built a flying-machine, and are learning to fly.&quot;&#10;&#10;I stopped, on hands and knees, for we had come to the bushes.&#10;&#10;&quot;Fly!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;fly.&quot;&#10;&#10;I went on into a little bower, and sat down.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is all over with humanity,&quot; I said.  &quot;If they can do that they&#10;will simply go round the world.&quot;&#10;&#10;He nodded.&#10;&#10;&quot;They will.  But---- It will relieve things over here a bit.  And&#10;besides----&quot;  He looked at me.  &quot;Aren't you satisfied it _is_ up with&#10;humanity?  I am.  We're down; we're beat.&quot;&#10;&#10;I stared.  Strange as it may seem, I had not arrived at this fact--a&#10;fact perfectly obvious so soon as he spoke.  I had still held a&#10;vague hope; rather, I had kept a lifelong habit of mind.  He repeated&#10;his words, &quot;We're beat.&quot;  They carried absolute conviction.&#10;&#10;&quot;It's all over,&quot; he said.  &quot;They've lost _one_--just _one_.  And they've&#10;made their footing good and crippled the greatest power in the world.&#10;They've walked over us.  The death of that one at Weybridge was an&#10;accident.  And these are only pioneers.  They kept on coming.  These&#10;green stars--I've seen none these five or six days, but I've no doubt&#10;they're falling somewhere every night.  Nothing's to be done.  We're&#10;under! We're beat!&quot;&#10;&#10;I made him no answer.  I sat staring before me, trying in vain to&#10;devise some countervailing thought.&#10;&#10;&quot;This isn't a war,&quot; said the artilleryman.  &quot;It never was a war,&#10;any more than there's war between man and ants.&quot;&#10;&#10;Suddenly I recalled the night in the observatory.&#10;&#10;&quot;After the tenth shot they fired no more--at least, until the first&#10;cylinder came.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How do you know?&quot; said the artilleryman.  I explained.  He thought.&#10;&quot;Something wrong with the gun,&quot; he said.  &quot;But what if there is?&#10;They'll get it right again.  And even if there's a delay, how can it&#10;alter the end?  It's just men and ants.  There's the ants builds their&#10;cities, live their lives, have wars, revolutions, until the men want&#10;them out of the way, and then they go out of the way.  That's what we&#10;are now--just ants.  Only----&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; I said.&#10;&#10;&quot;We're eatable ants.&quot;&#10;&#10;We sat looking at each other.&#10;&#10;&quot;And what will they do with us?&quot; I said.&#10;&#10;&quot;That's what I've been thinking,&quot; he said; &quot;that's what I've been&#10;thinking.  After Weybridge I went south--thinking.  I saw what was up.&#10;Most of the people were hard at it squealing and exciting themselves.&#10;But I'm not so fond of squealing.  I've been in sight of death once or&#10;twice; I'm not an ornamental soldier, and at the best and worst,&#10;death--it's just death.  And it's the man that keeps on thinking comes&#10;through.  I saw everyone tracking away south.  Says I, 'Food won't&#10;last this way,' and I turned right back.  I went for the Martians like&#10;a sparrow goes for man.  All round&quot;--he waved a hand to the&#10;horizon--&quot;they're starving in heaps, bolting, treading on each other.&#10;. . .&quot;&#10;&#10;He saw my face, and halted awkwardly.&#10;&#10;&quot;No doubt lots who had money have gone away to France,&quot; he said.  He&#10;seemed to hesitate whether to apologise, met my eyes, and went on:&#10;&quot;There's food all about here.  Canned things in shops; wines, spirits,&#10;mineral waters; and the water mains and drains are empty.  Well, I was&#10;telling you what I was thinking.  'Here's intelligent things,' I said,&#10;'and it seems they want us for food.  First, they'll smash us up--ships,&#10;machines, guns, cities, all the order and organisation.  All&#10;that will go.  If we were the size of ants we might pull through.  But&#10;we're not.  It's all too bulky to stop.  That's the first certainty.'&#10;Eh?&quot;&#10;&#10;I assented.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is; I've thought it out.  Very well, then--next; at present&#10;we're caught as we're wanted.  A Martian has only to go a few miles to&#10;get a crowd on the run.  And I saw one, one day, out by Wandsworth,&#10;picking houses to pieces and routing among the wreckage.  But they&#10;won't keep on doing that.  So soon as they've settled all our guns and&#10;ships, and smashed our railways, and done all the things they are&#10;doing over there, they will begin catching us systematic, picking the&#10;best and storing us in cages and things.  That's what they will start&#10;doing in a bit.  Lord!  They haven't begun on us yet.  Don't you see&#10;that?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Not begun!&quot; I exclaimed.&#10;&#10;&quot;Not begun.  All that's happened so far is through our not having&#10;the sense to keep quiet--worrying them with guns and such foolery.  And&#10;losing our heads, and rushing off in crowds to where there wasn't any&#10;more safety than where we were.  They don't want to bother us yet.&#10;They're making their things--making all the things they couldn't bring&#10;with them, getting things ready for the rest of their people.  Very&#10;likely that's why the cylinders have stopped for a bit, for fear of&#10;hitting those who are here.  And instead of our rushing about blind,&#10;on the howl, or getting dynamite on the chance of busting them up,&#10;we've got to fix ourselves up according to the new state of affairs.&#10;That's how I figure it out.  It isn't quite according to what a man&#10;wants for his species, but it's about what the facts point to.  And&#10;that's the principle I acted upon.  Cities, nations, civilisation,&#10;progress--it's all over.  That game's up.  We're beat.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But if that is so, what is there to live for?&quot;&#10;&#10;The artilleryman looked at me for a moment.&#10;&#10;&quot;There won't be any more blessed concerts for a million years or&#10;so; there won't be any Royal Academy of Arts, and no nice little feeds&#10;at restaurants.  If it's amusement you're after, I reckon the game is&#10;up.  If you've got any drawing-room manners or a dislike to eating&#10;peas with a knife or dropping aitches, you'd better chuck 'em away.&#10;They ain't no further use.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You mean----&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I mean that men like me are going on living--for the sake of the&#10;breed.  I tell you, I'm grim set on living.  And if I'm not mistaken,&#10;you'll show what insides _you've_ got, too, before long.  We aren't&#10;going to be exterminated.  And I don't mean to be caught either, and&#10;tamed and fattened and bred like a thundering ox.  Ugh! Fancy those&#10;brown creepers!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You don't mean to say----&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I do.  I'm going on, under their feet.  I've got it planned; I've&#10;thought it out.  We men are beat.  We don't know enough.  We've got to&#10;learn before we've got a chance.  And we've got to live and keep&#10;independent while we learn.  See! That's what has to be done.&quot;&#10;&#10;I stared, astonished, and stirred profoundly by the man's&#10;resolution.&#10;&#10;&quot;Great God!&quot; cried I.  &quot;But you are a man indeed!&quot;  And suddenly I&#10;gripped his hand.&#10;&#10;&quot;Eh!&quot; he said, with his eyes shining.  &quot;I've thought it out, eh?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Go on,&quot; I said.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, those who mean to escape their catching must get ready.  I'm&#10;getting ready.  Mind you, it isn't all of us that are made for wild&#10;beasts; and that's what it's got to be.  That's why I watched you.  I&#10;had my doubts.  You're slender.  I didn't know that it was you, you&#10;see, or just how you'd been buried.  All these--the sort of people&#10;that lived in these houses, and all those damn little clerks that used&#10;to live down that way--they'd be no good.  They haven't any spirit in&#10;them--no proud dreams and no proud lusts; and a man who hasn't one or&#10;the other--Lord!  What is he but funk and precautions?  They just used&#10;to skedaddle off to work--I've seen hundreds of 'em, bit of breakfast&#10;in hand, running wild and shining to catch their little season-ticket&#10;train, for fear they'd get dismissed if they didn't; working at&#10;businesses they were afraid to take the trouble to understand;&#10;skedaddling back for fear they wouldn't be in time for dinner; keeping&#10;indoors after dinner for fear of the back streets, and sleeping with&#10;the wives they married, not because they wanted them, but because they&#10;had a bit of money that would make for safety in their one little&#10;miserable skedaddle through the world.  Lives insured and a bit&#10;invested for fear of accidents.  And on Sundays--fear of the&#10;hereafter.  As if hell was built for rabbits!  Well, the Martians will&#10;just be a godsend to these.  Nice roomy cages, fattening food, careful&#10;breeding, no worry.  After a week or so chasing about the fields and&#10;lands on empty stomachs, they'll come and be caught cheerful.  They'll&#10;be quite glad after a bit.  They'll wonder what people did before&#10;there were Martians to take care of them.  And the bar loafers, and&#10;mashers, and singers--I can imagine them.  I can imagine them,&quot; he&#10;said, with a sort of sombre gratification.  &quot;There'll be any amount of&#10;sentiment and religion loose among them.  There's hundreds of things I&#10;saw with my eyes that I've only begun to see clearly these last few&#10;days.  There's lots will take things as they are--fat and stupid; and&#10;lots will be worried by a sort of feeling that it's all wrong, and&#10;that they ought to be doing something.  Now whenever things are so&#10;that a lot of people feel they ought to be doing something, the weak,&#10;and those who go weak with a lot of complicated thinking, always make&#10;for a sort of do-nothing religion, very pious and superior, and&#10;submit to persecution and the will of the Lord.  Very likely you've&#10;seen the same thing.  It's energy in a gale of funk, and turned clean&#10;inside out.  These cages will be full of psalms and hymns and piety.&#10;And those of a less simple sort will work in a bit of--what is&#10;it?--eroticism.&quot;&#10;&#10;He paused.&#10;&#10;&quot;Very likely these Martians will make pets of some of them; train&#10;them to do tricks--who knows?--get sentimental over the pet boy who&#10;grew up and had to be killed.  And some, maybe, they will train to&#10;hunt us.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No,&quot; I cried, &quot;that's impossible!  No human being----&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What's the good of going on with such lies?&quot; said the&#10;artilleryman.  &quot;There's men who'd do it cheerful.  What nonsense to&#10;pretend there isn't!&quot;&#10;&#10;And I succumbed to his conviction.&#10;&#10;&quot;If they come after me,&quot; he said; &quot;Lord, if they come after me!&quot;&#10;and subsided into a grim meditation.&#10;&#10;I sat contemplating these things.  I could find nothing to bring&#10;against this man's reasoning.  In the days before the invasion no one&#10;would have questioned my intellectual superiority to his--I, a&#10;professed and recognised writer on philosophical themes, and he, a&#10;common soldier; and yet he had already formulated a situation that I&#10;had scarcely realised.&#10;&#10;&quot;What are you doing?&quot; I said presently.  &quot;What plans have you&#10;made?&quot;&#10;&#10;He hesitated.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, it's like this,&quot; he said.  &quot;What have we to do?  We have to&#10;invent a sort of life where men can live and breed, and be&#10;sufficiently secure to bring the children up.  Yes--wait a bit, and&#10;I'll make it clearer what I think ought to be done.  The tame ones&#10;will go like all tame beasts; in a few generations they'll be big,&#10;beautiful, rich-blooded, stupid--rubbish! The risk is that we who keep&#10;wild will go savage--degenerate into a sort of big, savage rat. . . .&#10;You see, how I mean to live is underground.  I've been thinking about&#10;the drains.  Of course those who don't know drains think horrible&#10;things; but under this London are miles and miles--hundreds of&#10;miles--and a few days rain and London empty will leave them sweet and&#10;clean. The main drains are big enough and airy enough for anyone.&#10;Then there's cellars, vaults, stores, from which bolting passages may&#10;be made to the drains. And the railway tunnels and subways.  Eh?  You&#10;begin to see?  And we form a band--able-bodied, clean-minded men.&#10;We're not going to pick up any rubbish that drifts in.  Weaklings&#10;go out again.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;As you meant me to go?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well--I parleyed, didn't I?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We won't quarrel about that.  Go on.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Those who stop obey orders.  Able-bodied, clean-minded women we&#10;want also--mothers and teachers.  No lackadaisical ladies--no blasted&#10;rolling eyes.  We can't have any weak or silly.  Life is real again,&#10;and the useless and cumbersome and mischievous have to die.  They&#10;ought to die.  They ought to be willing to die.  It's a sort of&#10;disloyalty, after all, to live and taint the race.  And they can't be&#10;happy.  Moreover, dying's none so dreadful; it's the funking makes it&#10;bad.  And in all those places we shall gather.  Our district will be&#10;London.  And we may even be able to keep a watch, and run about in the&#10;open when the Martians keep away.  Play cricket, perhaps.  That's how&#10;we shall save the race.  Eh?  It's a possible thing?  But saving the&#10;race is nothing in itself.  As I say, that's only being rats.  It's&#10;saving our knowledge and adding to it is the thing.  There men like&#10;you come in.  There's books, there's models.  We must make great safe&#10;places down deep, and get all the books we can; not novels and poetry&#10;swipes, but ideas, science books.  That's where men like you come in.&#10;We must go to the British Museum and pick all those books through.&#10;Especially we must keep up our science--learn more.  We must watch&#10;these Martians.  Some of us must go as spies.  When it's all working,&#10;perhaps I will.  Get caught, I mean.  And the great thing is, we must&#10;leave the Martians alone.  We mustn't even steal.  If we get in their&#10;way, we clear out.  We must show them we mean no harm.  Yes, I know.&#10;But they're intelligent things, and they won't hunt us down if they&#10;have all they want, and think we're just harmless vermin.&quot;&#10;&#10;The artilleryman paused and laid a brown hand upon my arm.&#10;&#10;&quot;After all, it may not be so much we may have to learn before--Just&#10;imagine this: four or five of their fighting machines suddenly&#10;starting off--Heat-Rays right and left, and not a Martian in 'em.  Not&#10;a Martian in 'em, but men--men who have learned the way how.  It may&#10;be in my time, even--those men.  Fancy having one of them lovely&#10;things, with its Heat-Ray wide and free!  Fancy having it in control!&#10;What would it matter if you smashed to smithereens at the end of the&#10;run, after a bust like that?  I reckon the Martians'll open their&#10;beautiful eyes!  Can't you see them, man?  Can't you see them&#10;hurrying, hurrying--puffing and blowing and hooting to their other&#10;mechanical affairs?  Something out of gear in every case.  And swish,&#10;bang, rattle, swish!  Just as they are fumbling over it, _swish_ comes&#10;the Heat-Ray, and, behold! man has come back to his own.&quot;&#10;&#10;For a while the imaginative daring of the artilleryman, and the&#10;tone of assurance and courage he assumed, completely dominated my&#10;mind.  I believed unhesitatingly both in his forecast of human destiny&#10;and in the practicability of his astonishing scheme, and the reader&#10;who thinks me susceptible and foolish must contrast his position,&#10;reading steadily with all his thoughts about his subject, and mine,&#10;crouching fearfully in the bushes and listening, distracted by&#10;apprehension.  We talked in this manner through the early morning&#10;time, and later crept out of the bushes, and, after scanning the sky&#10;for Martians, hurried precipitately to the house on Putney Hill where&#10;he had made his lair.  It was the coal cellar of the place, and when I&#10;saw the work he had spent a week upon--it was a burrow scarcely ten&#10;yards long, which he designed to reach to the main drain on Putney&#10;Hill--I had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his&#10;powers.  Such a hole I could have dug in a day.  But I believed in him&#10;sufficiently to work with him all that morning until past midday at&#10;his digging.  We had a garden barrow and shot the earth we removed&#10;against the kitchen range.  We refreshed ourselves with a tin of&#10;mock-turtle soup and wine from the neighbouring pantry.  I found a&#10;curious relief from the aching strangeness of the world in this steady&#10;labour. As we worked, I turned his project over in my mind, and&#10;presently objections and doubts began to arise; but I worked there all&#10;the morning, so glad was I to find myself with a purpose again.  After&#10;working an hour I began to speculate on the distance one had to go&#10;before the cloaca was reached, the chances we had of missing it&#10;altogether.  My immediate trouble was why we should dig this long&#10;tunnel, when it was possible to get into the drain at once down one of&#10;the manholes, and work back to the house.  It seemed to me, too, that&#10;the house was inconveniently chosen, and required a needless length of&#10;tunnel.  And just as I was beginning to face these things, the&#10;artilleryman stopped digging, and looked at me.&#10;&#10;&quot;We're working well,&quot; he said.  He put down his spade. &quot;Let us&#10;knock off a bit&quot; he said.  &quot;I think it's time we reconnoitred from the&#10;roof of the house.&quot;&#10;&#10;I was for going on, and after a little hesitation he resumed his&#10;spade; and then suddenly I was struck by a thought.  I stopped, and so&#10;did he at once.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why were you walking about the common,&quot; I said, &quot;instead of being&#10;here?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Taking the air,&quot; he said.  &quot;I was coming back.  It's safer by&#10;night.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But the work?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, one can't always work,&quot; he said, and in a flash I saw the man&#10;plain.  He hesitated, holding his spade.  &quot;We ought to reconnoitre&#10;now,&quot; he said, &quot;because if any come near they may hear the spades and&#10;drop upon us unawares.&quot;&#10;&#10;I was no longer disposed to object.  We went together to the roof&#10;and stood on a ladder peeping out of the roof door.  No Martians were&#10;to be seen, and we ventured out on the tiles, and slipped down under&#10;shelter of the parapet.&#10;&#10;From this position a shrubbery hid the greater portion of Putney,&#10;but we could see the river below, a bubbly mass of red weed, and the&#10;low parts of Lambeth flooded and red.  The red creeper swarmed up the&#10;trees about the old palace, and their branches stretched gaunt and&#10;dead, and set with shrivelled leaves, from amid its clusters.  It was&#10;strange how entirely dependent both these things were upon flowing&#10;water for their propagation.  About us neither had gained a footing;&#10;laburnums, pink mays, snowballs, and trees of arbor-vitae, rose out of&#10;laurels and hydrangeas, green and brilliant into the sunlight.  Beyond&#10;Kensington dense smoke was rising, and that and a blue haze hid the&#10;northward hills.&#10;&#10;The artilleryman began to tell me of the sort of people who still&#10;remained in London.&#10;&#10;&quot;One night last week,&quot; he said, &quot;some fools got the electric light&#10;in order, and there was all Regent Street and the Circus ablaze,&#10;crowded with painted and ragged drunkards, men and women, dancing and&#10;shouting till dawn.  A man who was there told me.  And as the day came&#10;they became aware of a fighting-machine standing near by the Langham&#10;and looking down at them.  Heaven knows how long he had been there.&#10;It must have given some of them a nasty turn.  He came down the road&#10;towards them, and picked up nearly a hundred too drunk or frightened&#10;to run away.&quot;&#10;&#10;Grotesque gleam of a time no history will ever fully describe!&#10;&#10;From that, in answer to my questions, he came round to his&#10;grandiose plans again.  He grew enthusiastic.  He talked so eloquently&#10;of the possibility of capturing a fighting-machine that I more than&#10;half believed in him again.  But now that I was beginning to&#10;understand something of his quality, I could divine the stress he laid&#10;on doing nothing precipitately.  And I noted that now there was no&#10;question that he personally was to capture and fight the great&#10;machine.&#10;&#10;After a time we went down to the cellar.  Neither of us seemed&#10;disposed to resume digging, and when he suggested a meal, I was&#10;nothing loath.  He became suddenly very generous, and when we had&#10;eaten he went away and returned with some excellent cigars.  We lit&#10;these, and his optimism glowed.  He was inclined to regard my coming&#10;as a great occasion.&#10;&#10;&quot;There's some champagne in the cellar,&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;&quot;We can dig better on this Thames-side burgundy,&quot; said I.&#10;&#10;&quot;No,&quot; said he; &quot;I am host today.  Champagne!  Great God! We've a&#10;heavy enough task before us!  Let us take a rest and gather strength&#10;while we may.  Look at these blistered hands!&quot;&#10;&#10;And pursuant to this idea of a holiday, he insisted upon playing&#10;cards after we had eaten.  He taught me euchre, and after dividing&#10;London between us, I taking the northern side and he the southern, we&#10;played for parish points.  Grotesque and foolish as this will seem to&#10;the sober reader, it is absolutely true, and what is more remarkable,&#10;I found the card game and several others we played extremely&#10;interesting.&#10;&#10;Strange mind of man! that, with our species upon the edge of&#10;extermination or appalling degradation, with no clear prospect before&#10;us but the chance of a horrible death, we could sit following the&#10;chance of this painted pasteboard, and playing the &quot;joker&quot; with vivid&#10;delight.  Afterwards he taught me poker, and I beat him at three tough&#10;chess games.  When dark came we decided to take the risk, and lit a&#10;lamp.&#10;&#10;After an interminable string of games, we supped, and the&#10;artilleryman finished the champagne.  We went on smoking the cigars.&#10;He was no longer the energetic regenerator of his species I had&#10;encountered in the morning.  He was still optimistic, but it was a&#10;less kinetic, a more thoughtful optimism.  I remember he wound up with&#10;my health, proposed in a speech of small variety and considerable&#10;intermittence.  I took a cigar, and went upstairs to look at the&#10;lights of which he had spoken that blazed so greenly along the&#10;Highgate hills.&#10;&#10;At first I stared unintelligently across the London valley.  The&#10;northern hills were shrouded in darkness; the fires near Kensington&#10;glowed redly, and now and then an orange-red tongue of flame flashed&#10;up and vanished in the deep blue night.  All the rest of London&#10;was black.  Then, nearer, I perceived a strange light, a pale,&#10;violet-purple fluorescent glow, quivering under the night breeze.  For&#10;a space I could not understand it, and then I knew that it must be&#10;the red weed from which this faint irradiation proceeded.  With that&#10;realisation my dormant sense of wonder, my sense of the proportion of&#10;things, awoke again.  I glanced from that to Mars, red and clear,&#10;glowing high in the west, and then gazed long and earnestly at the&#10;darkness of Hampstead and Highgate.&#10;&#10;I remained a very long time upon the roof, wondering at the&#10;grotesque changes of the day.  I recalled my mental states from the&#10;midnight prayer to the foolish card-playing.  I had a violent&#10;revulsion of feeling.  I remember I flung away the cigar with a&#10;certain wasteful symbolism.  My folly came to me with glaring&#10;exaggeration.  I seemed a traitor to my wife and to my kind; I was&#10;filled with remorse.  I resolved to leave this strange undisciplined&#10;dreamer of great things to his drink and gluttony, and to go on into&#10;London.  There, it seemed to me, I had the best chance of learning&#10;what the Martians and my fellowmen were doing.  I was still upon the&#10;roof when the late moon rose.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER EIGHT&#10;&#10;DEAD LONDON&#10;&#10;&#10;After I had parted from the artilleryman, I went down the hill, and&#10;by the High Street across the bridge to Fulham.  The red weed was&#10;tumultuous at that time, and nearly choked the bridge roadway; but its&#10;fronds were already whitened in patches by the spreading disease that&#10;presently removed it so swiftly.&#10;&#10;At the corner of the lane that runs to Putney Bridge station I&#10;found a man lying.  He was as black as a sweep with the black dust,&#10;alive, but helplessly and speechlessly drunk.  I could get nothing&#10;from him but curses and furious lunges at my head.  I think I should&#10;have stayed by him but for the brutal expression of his face.&#10;&#10;There was black dust along the roadway from the bridge onwards, and&#10;it grew thicker in Fulham.  The streets were horribly quiet.  I got&#10;food--sour, hard, and mouldy, but quite eatable--in a baker's shop&#10;here.  Some way towards Walham Green the streets became clear of&#10;powder, and I passed a white terrace of houses on fire; the noise of&#10;the burning was an absolute relief.  Going on towards Brompton, the&#10;streets were quiet again.&#10;&#10;Here I came once more upon the black powder in the streets and upon&#10;dead bodies.  I saw altogether about a dozen in the length of the&#10;Fulham Road.  They had been dead many days, so that I hurried quickly&#10;past them.  The black powder covered them over, and softened their&#10;outlines.  One or two had been disturbed by dogs.&#10;&#10;Where there was no black powder, it was curiously like a Sunday in&#10;the City, with the closed shops, the houses locked up and the blinds&#10;drawn, the desertion, and the stillness.  In some places plunderers&#10;had been at work, but rarely at other than the provision and wine&#10;shops.  A jeweller's window had been broken open in one place, but&#10;apparently the thief had been disturbed, and a number of gold chains&#10;and a watch lay scattered on the pavement.  I did not trouble to touch&#10;them.  Farther on was a tattered woman in a heap on a doorstep; the&#10;hand that hung over her knee was gashed and bled down her rusty brown&#10;dress, and a smashed magnum of champagne formed a pool across the&#10;pavement.  She seemed asleep, but she was dead.&#10;&#10;The farther I penetrated into London, the profounder grew the&#10;stillness.  But it was not so much the stillness of death--it was the&#10;stillness of suspense, of expectation.  At any time the destruction&#10;that had already singed the northwestern borders of the metropolis,&#10;and had annihilated Ealing and Kilburn, might strike among these&#10;houses and leave them smoking ruins.  It was a city condemned and&#10;derelict. . . .&#10;&#10;In South Kensington the streets were clear of dead and of black&#10;powder.  It was near South Kensington that I first heard the howling.&#10;It crept almost imperceptibly upon my senses.  It was a sobbing&#10;alternation of two notes, &quot;Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,&quot; keeping on&#10;perpetually.  When I passed streets that ran northward it grew in&#10;volume, and houses and buildings seemed to deaden and cut it off&#10;again.  It came in a full tide down Exhibition Road.  I stopped,&#10;staring towards Kensington Gardens, wondering at this strange, remote&#10;wailing.  It was as if that mighty desert of houses had found a voice&#10;for its fear and solitude.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,&quot; wailed that superhuman note--great waves&#10;of sound sweeping down the broad, sunlit roadway, between the tall&#10;buildings on each side.  I turned northwards, marvelling, towards the&#10;iron gates of Hyde Park.  I had half a mind to break into the Natural&#10;History Museum and find my way up to the summits of the towers, in&#10;order to see across the park.  But I decided to keep to the ground,&#10;where quick hiding was possible, and so went on up the Exhibition&#10;Road.  All the large mansions on each side of the road were empty and&#10;still, and my footsteps echoed against the sides of the houses.  At&#10;the top, near the park gate, I came upon a strange sight--a bus&#10;overturned, and the skeleton of a horse picked clean.  I puzzled over&#10;this for a time, and then went on to the bridge over the Serpentine.&#10;The voice grew stronger and stronger, though I could see nothing above&#10;the housetops on the north side of the park, save a haze of smoke to&#10;the northwest.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,&quot; cried the voice, coming, as it seemed to&#10;me, from the district about Regent's Park.  The desolating cry worked&#10;upon my mind.  The mood that had sustained me passed.  The wailing&#10;took possession of me.  I found I was intensely weary, footsore, and&#10;now again hungry and thirsty.&#10;&#10;It was already past noon.  Why was I wandering alone in this city&#10;of the dead?  Why was I alone when all London was lying in state, and&#10;in its black shroud?  I felt intolerably lonely.  My mind ran on old&#10;friends that I had forgotten for years.  I thought of the poisons in&#10;the chemists' shops, of the liquors the wine merchants stored; I&#10;recalled the two sodden creatures of despair, who so far as I knew,&#10;shared the city with myself. . . .&#10;&#10;I came into Oxford Street by the Marble Arch, and here again were&#10;black powder and several bodies, and an evil, ominous smell from the&#10;gratings of the cellars of some of the houses.  I grew very thirsty&#10;after the heat of my long walk.  With infinite trouble I managed to&#10;break into a public-house and get food and drink.  I was weary after&#10;eating, and went into the parlour behind the bar, and slept on a black&#10;horsehair sofa I found there.&#10;&#10;I awoke to find that dismal howling still in my ears, &quot;Ulla, ulla,&#10;ulla, ulla.&quot;  It was now dusk, and after I had routed out some&#10;biscuits and a cheese in the bar--there was a meat safe, but it&#10;contained nothing but maggots--I wandered on through the silent&#10;residential squares to Baker Street--Portman Square is the only one I&#10;can name--and so came out at last upon Regent's Park.  And as I&#10;emerged from the top of Baker Street, I saw far away over the trees in&#10;the clearness of the sunset the hood of the Martian giant from which&#10;this howling proceeded.  I was not terrified.  I came upon him as if&#10;it were a matter of course.  I watched him for some time, but he did&#10;not move.  He appeared to be standing and yelling, for no reason that&#10;I could discover.&#10;&#10;I tried to formulate a plan of action.  That perpetual sound of&#10;&quot;Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,&quot; confused my mind.  Perhaps I was too tired&#10;to be very fearful.  Certainly I was more curious to know the reason&#10;of this monotonous crying than afraid.  I turned back away from the&#10;park and struck into Park Road, intending to skirt the park, went&#10;along under the shelter of the terraces, and got a view of this&#10;stationary, howling Martian from the direction of St. John's Wood.  A&#10;couple of hundred yards out of Baker Street I heard a yelping chorus,&#10;and saw, first a dog with a piece of putrescent red meat in his jaws&#10;coming headlong towards me, and then a pack of starving mongrels in&#10;pursuit of him.  He made a wide curve to avoid me, as though he feared&#10;I might prove a fresh competitor.  As the yelping died away down the&#10;silent road, the wailing sound of &quot;Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,&quot; reasserted&#10;itself.&#10;&#10;I came upon the wrecked handling-machine halfway to St. John's Wood&#10;station.  At first I thought a house had fallen across the road.  It&#10;was only as I clambered among the ruins that I saw, with a start, this&#10;mechanical Samson lying, with its tentacles bent and smashed and&#10;twisted, among the ruins it had made.  The forepart was shattered.  It&#10;seemed as if it had driven blindly straight at the house, and had been&#10;overwhelmed in its overthrow.  It seemed to me then that this might&#10;have happened by a handling-machine escaping from the guidance of its&#10;Martian.  I could not clamber among the ruins to see it, and the&#10;twilight was now so far advanced that the blood with which its seat&#10;was smeared, and the gnawed gristle of the Martian that the dogs had&#10;left, were invisible to me.&#10;&#10;Wondering still more at all that I had seen, I pushed on towards&#10;Primrose Hill.  Far away, through a gap in the trees, I saw a second&#10;Martian, as motionless as the first, standing in the park towards the&#10;Zoological Gardens, and silent.  A little beyond the ruins about the&#10;smashed handling-machine I came upon the red weed again, and found the&#10;Regent's Canal, a spongy mass of dark-red vegetation.&#10;&#10;As I crossed the bridge, the sound of &quot;Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,&quot;&#10;ceased.  It was, as it were, cut off.  The silence came like a&#10;thunderclap.&#10;&#10;The dusky houses about me stood faint and tall and dim; the trees&#10;towards the park were growing black.  All about me the red weed&#10;clambered among the ruins, writhing to get above me in the dimness.&#10;Night, the mother of fear and mystery, was coming upon me.  But while&#10;that voice sounded the solitude, the desolation, had been endurable;&#10;by virtue of it London had still seemed alive, and the sense of life&#10;about me had upheld me.  Then suddenly a change, the passing of&#10;something--I knew not what--and then a stillness that could be felt.&#10;Nothing but this gaunt quiet.&#10;&#10;London about me gazed at me spectrally.  The windows in the white&#10;houses were like the eye sockets of skulls.  About me my imagination&#10;found a thousand noiseless enemies moving.  Terror seized me, a horror&#10;of my temerity.  In front of me the road became pitchy black as though&#10;it was tarred, and I saw a contorted shape lying across the pathway.  I&#10;could not bring myself to go on.  I turned down St. John's Wood Road,&#10;and ran headlong from this unendurable stillness towards Kilburn.  I&#10;hid from the night and the silence, until long after midnight, in a&#10;cabmen's shelter in Harrow Road.  But before the dawn my courage&#10;returned, and while the stars were still in the sky I turned once more&#10;towards Regent's Park.  I missed my way among the streets, and&#10;presently saw down a long avenue, in the half-light of the early dawn,&#10;the curve of Primrose Hill.  On the summit, towering up to the fading&#10;stars, was a third Martian, erect and motionless like the others.&#10;&#10;An insane resolve possessed me.  I would die and end it.  And I&#10;would save myself even the trouble of killing myself.  I marched on&#10;recklessly towards this Titan, and then, as I drew nearer and the&#10;light grew, I saw that a multitude of black birds was circling and&#10;clustering about the hood.  At that my heart gave a bound, and I began&#10;running along the road.&#10;&#10;I hurried through the red weed that choked St. Edmund's Terrace (I&#10;waded breast-high across a torrent of water that was rushing down from&#10;the waterworks towards the Albert Road), and emerged upon the grass&#10;before the rising of the sun.  Great mounds had been heaped about the&#10;crest of the hill, making a huge redoubt of it--it was the final and&#10;largest place the Martians had made--and from behind these heaps there&#10;rose a thin smoke against the sky.  Against the sky line an eager dog&#10;ran and disappeared.  The thought that had flashed into my mind grew&#10;real, grew credible.  I felt no fear, only a wild, trembling&#10;exultation, as I ran up the hill towards the motionless monster.  Out&#10;of the hood hung lank shreds of brown, at which the hungry birds&#10;pecked and tore.&#10;&#10;In another moment I had scrambled up the earthen rampart and stood&#10;upon its crest, and the interior of the redoubt was below me.  A&#10;mighty space it was, with gigantic machines here and there within it,&#10;huge mounds of material and strange shelter places.  And scattered&#10;about it, some in their overturned war-machines, some in the now rigid&#10;handling-machines, and a dozen of them stark and silent and laid in a&#10;row, were the Martians--_dead_!--slain by the putrefactive and disease&#10;bacteria against which their systems were unprepared; slain as the red&#10;weed was being slain; slain, after all man's devices had failed, by&#10;the humblest things that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this earth.&#10;&#10;For so it had come about, as indeed I and many men might have&#10;foreseen had not terror and disaster blinded our minds.  These&#10;germs of disease have taken toll of humanity since the beginning of&#10;things--taken toll of our prehuman ancestors since life began here.&#10;But by virtue of this natural selection of our kind we have developed&#10;resisting power; to no germs do we succumb without a struggle, and to&#10;many--those that cause putrefaction in dead matter, for instance--our&#10;living frames are altogether immune.  But there are no bacteria in&#10;Mars, and directly these invaders arrived, directly they drank and&#10;fed, our microscopic allies began to work their overthrow.  Already&#10;when I watched them they were irrevocably doomed, dying and rotting&#10;even as they went to and fro.  It was inevitable.  By the toll of a&#10;billion deaths man has bought his birthright of the earth, and it is&#10;his against all comers; it would still be his were the Martians ten&#10;times as mighty as they are.  For neither do men live nor die in vain.&#10;&#10;Here and there they were scattered, nearly fifty altogether, in&#10;that great gulf they had made, overtaken by a death that must have&#10;seemed to them as incomprehensible as any death could be.  To me also&#10;at that time this death was incomprehensible.  All I knew was that&#10;these things that had been alive and so terrible to men were dead.&#10;For a moment I believed that the destruction of Sennacherib had been&#10;repeated, that God had repented, that the Angel of Death had slain&#10;them in the night.&#10;&#10;I stood staring into the pit, and my heart lightened gloriously,&#10;even as the rising sun struck the world to fire about me with his&#10;rays.  The pit was still in darkness; the mighty engines, so great and&#10;wonderful in their power and complexity, so unearthly in their&#10;tortuous forms, rose weird and vague and strange out of the shadows&#10;towards the light.  A multitude of dogs, I could hear, fought over the&#10;bodies that lay darkly in the depth of the pit, far below me.  Across&#10;the pit on its farther lip, flat and vast and strange, lay the great&#10;flying-machine with which they had been experimenting upon our denser&#10;atmosphere when decay and death arrested them.  Death had come not a&#10;day too soon.  At the sound of a cawing overhead I looked up at the&#10;huge fighting-machine that would fight no more for ever, at the&#10;tattered red shreds of flesh that dripped down upon the overturned&#10;seats on the summit of Primrose Hill.&#10;&#10;I turned and looked down the slope of the hill to where, enhaloed&#10;now in birds, stood those other two Martians that I had seen&#10;overnight, just as death had overtaken them.  The one had died, even&#10;as it had been crying to its companions; perhaps it was the last to&#10;die, and its voice had gone on perpetually until the force of its&#10;machinery was exhausted.  They glittered now, harmless tripod towers&#10;of shining metal, in the brightness of the rising sun.&#10;&#10;All about the pit, and saved as by a miracle from everlasting&#10;destruction, stretched the great Mother of Cities.  Those who have only&#10;seen London veiled in her sombre robes of smoke can scarcely imagine&#10;the naked clearness and beauty of the silent wilderness of houses.&#10;&#10;Eastward, over the blackened ruins of the Albert Terrace and the&#10;splintered spire of the church, the sun blazed dazzling in a clear&#10;sky, and here and there some facet in the great wilderness of roofs&#10;caught the light and glared with a white intensity.&#10;&#10;Northward were Kilburn and Hampsted, blue and crowded with houses;&#10;westward the great city was dimmed; and southward, beyond the&#10;Martians, the green waves of Regent's Park, the Langham Hotel, the&#10;dome of the Albert Hall, the Imperial Institute, and the giant&#10;mansions of the Brompton Road came out clear and little in the&#10;sunrise, the jagged ruins of Westminster rising hazily beyond.  Far&#10;away and blue were the Surrey hills, and the towers of the Crystal&#10;Palace glittered like two silver rods.  The dome of St. Paul's was&#10;dark against the sunrise, and injured, I saw for the first time, by a&#10;huge gaping cavity on its western side.&#10;&#10;And as I looked at this wide expanse of houses and factories and&#10;churches, silent and abandoned; as I thought of the multitudinous&#10;hopes and efforts, the innumerable hosts of lives that had gone to&#10;build this human reef, and of the swift and ruthless destruction that&#10;had hung over it all; when I realised that the shadow had been rolled&#10;back, and that men might still live in the streets, and this dear vast&#10;dead city of mine be once more alive and powerful, I felt a wave of&#10;emotion that was near akin to tears.&#10;&#10;The torment was over.  Even that day the healing would begin.  The&#10;survivors of the people scattered over the country--leaderless,&#10;lawless, foodless, like sheep without a shepherd--the thousands who&#10;had fled by sea, would begin to return; the pulse of life, growing&#10;stronger and stronger, would beat again in the empty streets and pour&#10;across the vacant squares.  Whatever destruction was done, the hand of&#10;the destroyer was stayed.  All the gaunt wrecks, the blackened&#10;skeletons of houses that stared so dismally at the sunlit grass of the&#10;hill, would presently be echoing with the hammers of the restorers and&#10;ringing with the tapping of their trowels.  At the thought I extended&#10;my hands towards the sky and began thanking God.  In a year, thought&#10;I--in a year. . .&#10;&#10;With overwhelming force came the thought of myself, of my wife, and&#10;the old life of hope and tender helpfulness that had ceased for ever.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER NINE&#10;&#10;WRECKAGE&#10;&#10;&#10;And now comes the strangest thing in my story.  Yet, perhaps, it is&#10;not altogether strange.  I remember, clearly and coldly and vividly,&#10;all that I did that day until the time that I stood weeping and&#10;praising God upon the summit of Primrose Hill.  And then I forget.&#10;&#10;Of the next three days I know nothing.  I have learned since that,&#10;so far from my being the first discoverer of the Martian overthrow,&#10;several such wanderers as myself had already discovered this on the&#10;previous night.  One man--the first--had gone to St. Martin's-le-Grand,&#10;and, while I sheltered in the cabmen's hut, had contrived to&#10;telegraph to Paris.  Thence the joyful news had flashed all over the&#10;world; a thousand cities, chilled by ghastly apprehensions, suddenly&#10;flashed into frantic illuminations; they knew of it in Dublin,&#10;Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham, at the time when I stood upon the&#10;verge of the pit.  Already men, weeping with joy, as I have heard,&#10;shouting and staying their work to shake hands and shout, were making&#10;up trains, even as near as Crewe, to descend upon London.  The church&#10;bells that had ceased a fortnight since suddenly caught the news,&#10;until all England was bell-ringing.  Men on cycles, lean-faced,&#10;unkempt, scorched along every country lane shouting of unhoped&#10;deliverance, shouting to gaunt, staring figures of despair.  And for&#10;the food!  Across the Channel, across the Irish Sea, across the&#10;Atlantic, corn, bread, and meat were tearing to our relief.  All the&#10;shipping in the world seemed going Londonward in those days.  But of&#10;all this I have no memory.  I drifted--a demented man.  I found myself&#10;in a house of kindly people, who had found me on the third day&#10;wandering, weeping, and raving through the streets of St. John's Wood.&#10;They have told me since that I was singing some insane doggerel about&#10;&quot;The Last Man Left Alive! Hurrah!  The Last Man Left Alive!&quot;  Troubled&#10;as they were with their own affairs, these people, whose name, much as&#10;I would like to express my gratitude to them, I may not even give&#10;here, nevertheless cumbered themselves with me, sheltered me, and&#10;protected me from myself.  Apparently they had learned something of my&#10;story from me during the days of my lapse.&#10;&#10;Very gently, when my mind was assured again, did they break to me&#10;what they had learned of the fate of Leatherhead.  Two days after I&#10;was imprisoned it had been destroyed, with every soul in it, by a&#10;Martian.  He had swept it out of existence, as it seemed, without any&#10;provocation, as a boy might crush an ant hill, in the mere wantonness&#10;of power.&#10;&#10;I was a lonely man, and they were very kind to me.  I was a lonely&#10;man and a sad one, and they bore with me.  I remained with them four&#10;days after my recovery.  All that time I felt a vague, a growing&#10;craving to look once more on whatever remained of the little life that&#10;seemed so happy and bright in my past.  It was a mere hopeless desire&#10;to feast upon my misery.  They dissuaded me.  They did all they could&#10;to divert me from this morbidity.  But at last I could resist the&#10;impulse no longer, and, promising faithfully to return to them, and&#10;parting, as I will confess, from these four-day friends with tears, I&#10;went out again into the streets that had lately been so dark and&#10;strange and empty.&#10;&#10;Already they were busy with returning people; in places even there&#10;were shops open, and I saw a drinking fountain running water.&#10;&#10;I remember how mockingly bright the day seemed as I went back on my&#10;melancholy pilgrimage to the little house at Woking, how busy the&#10;streets and vivid the moving life about me.  So many people were&#10;abroad everywhere, busied in a thousand activities, that it seemed&#10;incredible that any great proportion of the population could have been&#10;slain.  But then I noticed how yellow were the skins of the people I&#10;met, how shaggy the hair of the men, how large and bright their eyes,&#10;and that every other man still wore his dirty rags.  Their faces&#10;seemed all with one of two expressions--a leaping exultation and&#10;energy or a grim resolution.  Save for the expression of the faces,&#10;London seemed a city of tramps.  The vestries were indiscriminately&#10;distributing bread sent us by the French government.  The ribs of the&#10;few horses showed dismally.  Haggard special constables with white&#10;badges stood at the corners of every street.  I saw little of the&#10;mischief wrought by the Martians until I reached Wellington Street,&#10;and there I saw the red weed clambering over the buttresses of&#10;Waterloo Bridge.&#10;&#10;At the corner of the bridge, too, I saw one of the common contrasts&#10;of that grotesque time--a sheet of paper flaunting against a thicket&#10;of the red weed, transfixed by a stick that kept it in place.  It was&#10;the placard of the first newspaper to resume publication--the _Daily&#10;Mail_.  I bought a copy for a blackened shilling I found in my pocket.&#10;Most of it was in blank, but the solitary compositor who did the thing&#10;had amused himself by making a grotesque scheme of advertisement&#10;stereo on the back page.  The matter he printed was emotional; the&#10;news organisation had not as yet found its way back.  I learned&#10;nothing fresh except that already in one week the examination of the&#10;Martian mechanisms had yielded astonishing results.  Among other&#10;things, the article assured me what I did not believe at the time,&#10;that the &quot;Secret of Flying,&quot; was discovered.  At Waterloo I found the&#10;free trains that were taking people to their homes.  The first rush&#10;was already over.  There were few people in the train, and I was in no&#10;mood for casual conversation.  I got a compartment to myself, and sat&#10;with folded arms, looking greyly at the sunlit devastation that flowed&#10;past the windows.  And just outside the terminus the train jolted over&#10;temporary rails, and on either side of the railway the houses were&#10;blackened ruins.  To Clapham Junction the face of London was grimy&#10;with powder of the Black Smoke, in spite of two days of thunderstorms&#10;and rain, and at Clapham Junction the line had been wrecked again;&#10;there were hundreds of out-of-work clerks and shopmen working side by&#10;side with the customary navvies, and we were jolted over a hasty&#10;relaying.&#10;&#10;All down the line from there the aspect of the country was gaunt&#10;and unfamiliar; Wimbledon particularly had suffered.  Walton, by virtue&#10;of its unburned pine woods, seemed the least hurt of any place along&#10;the line.  The Wandle, the Mole, every little stream, was a heaped&#10;mass of red weed, in appearance between butcher's meat and pickled&#10;cabbage.  The Surrey pine woods were too dry, however, for the festoons&#10;of the red climber.  Beyond Wimbledon, within sight of the line, in&#10;certain nursery grounds, were the heaped masses of earth about the&#10;sixth cylinder.  A number of people were standing about it, and some&#10;sappers were busy in the midst of it.  Over it flaunted a Union Jack,&#10;flapping cheerfully in the morning breeze.  The nursery grounds were&#10;everywhere crimson with the weed, a wide expanse of livid colour cut&#10;with purple shadows, and very painful to the eye.  One's gaze went&#10;with infinite relief from the scorched greys and sullen reds of the&#10;foreground to the blue-green softness of the eastward hills.&#10;&#10;The line on the London side of Woking station was still undergoing&#10;repair, so I descended at Byfleet station and took the road to&#10;Maybury, past the place where I and the artilleryman had talked to the&#10;hussars, and on by the spot where the Martian had appeared to me in&#10;the thunderstorm.  Here, moved by curiosity, I turned aside to find,&#10;among a tangle of red fronds, the warped and broken dog cart with the&#10;whitened bones of the horse scattered and gnawed.  For a time I stood&#10;regarding these vestiges. . . .&#10;&#10;Then I returned through the pine wood, neck-high with red weed here&#10;and there, to find the landlord of the Spotted Dog had already found&#10;burial, and so came home past the College Arms.  A man standing at an&#10;open cottage door greeted me by name as I passed.&#10;&#10;I looked at my house with a quick flash of hope that faded&#10;immediately.  The door had been forced; it was unfast and was opening&#10;slowly as I approached.&#10;&#10;It slammed again.  The curtains of my study fluttered out of the&#10;open window from which I and the artilleryman had watched the dawn.  No&#10;one had closed it since.  The smashed bushes were just as I had left&#10;them nearly four weeks ago.  I stumbled into the hall, and the house&#10;felt empty.  The stair carpet was ruffled and discoloured where I had&#10;crouched, soaked to the skin from the thunderstorm the night of the&#10;catastrophe.  Our muddy footsteps I saw still went up the stairs.&#10;&#10;I followed them to my study, and found lying on my writing-table&#10;still, with the selenite paper weight upon it, the sheet of work I had&#10;left on the afternoon of the opening of the cylinder.  For a space I&#10;stood reading over my abandoned arguments.  It was a paper on the&#10;probable development of Moral Ideas with the development of the&#10;civilising process; and the last sentence was the opening of a&#10;prophecy: &quot;In about two hundred years,&quot; I had written, &quot;we may&#10;expect----&quot;  The sentence ended abruptly.  I remembered my inability&#10;to fix my mind that morning, scarcely a month gone by, and how I had&#10;broken off to get my _Daily Chronicle_ from the newsboy.  I remembered&#10;how I went down to the garden gate as he came along, and how I had&#10;listened to his odd story of &quot;Men from Mars.&quot;&#10;&#10;I came down and went into the dining room.  There were the mutton&#10;and the bread, both far gone now in decay, and a beer bottle&#10;overturned, just as I and the artilleryman had left them.  My home was&#10;desolate.  I perceived the folly of the faint hope I had cherished so&#10;long.  And then a strange thing occurred.  &quot;It is no use,&quot; said a&#10;voice.  &quot;The house is deserted.  No one has been here these ten days.&#10;Do not stay here to torment yourself.  No one escaped but you.&quot;&#10;&#10;I was startled.  Had I spoken my thought aloud?  I turned, and the&#10;French window was open behind me.  I made a step to it, and stood&#10;looking out.&#10;&#10;And there, amazed and afraid, even as I stood amazed and afraid,&#10;were my cousin and my wife--my wife white and tearless.  She gave a&#10;faint cry.&#10;&#10;&quot;I came,&quot; she said.  &quot;I knew--knew----&quot;&#10;&#10;She put her hand to her throat--swayed.  I made a step forward, and&#10;caught her in my arms.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER TEN&#10;&#10;THE EPILOGUE&#10;&#10;&#10;I cannot but regret, now that I am concluding my story, how little&#10;I am able to contribute to the discussion of the many debatable&#10;questions which are still unsettled.  In one respect I shall certainly&#10;provoke criticism.  My particular province is speculative philosophy.&#10;My knowledge of comparative physiology is confined to a book or two,&#10;but it seems to me that Carver's suggestions as to the reason of the&#10;rapid death of the Martians is so probable as to be regarded almost as&#10;a proven conclusion.  I have assumed that in the body of my narrative.&#10;&#10;At any rate, in all the bodies of the Martians that were examined&#10;after the war, no bacteria except those already known as terrestrial&#10;species were found.  That they did not bury any of their dead, and the&#10;reckless slaughter they perpetrated, point also to an entire ignorance&#10;of the putrefactive process.  But probable as this seems, it is by no&#10;means a proven conclusion.&#10;&#10;Neither is the composition of the Black Smoke known, which the&#10;Martians used with such deadly effect, and the generator of the&#10;Heat-Rays remains a puzzle.  The terrible disasters at the Ealing&#10;and South Kensington laboratories have disinclined analysts for further&#10;investigations upon the latter.  Spectrum analysis of the black powder&#10;points unmistakably to the presence of an unknown element with a&#10;brilliant group of three lines in the green, and it is possible that&#10;it combines with argon to form a compound which acts at once with&#10;deadly effect upon some constituent in the blood.  But such unproven&#10;speculations will scarcely be of interest to the general reader, to&#10;whom this story is addressed.  None of the brown scum that drifted&#10;down the Thames after the destruction of Shepperton was examined at&#10;the time, and now none is forthcoming.&#10;&#10;The results of an anatomical examination of the Martians, so far&#10;as the prowling dogs had left such an examination possible, I have&#10;already given.  But everyone is familiar with the magnificent and&#10;almost complete specimen in spirits at the Natural History Museum, and&#10;the countless drawings that have been made from it; and beyond that&#10;the interest of their physiology and structure is purely scientific.&#10;&#10;A question of graver and universal interest is the possibility of&#10;another attack from the Martians.  I do not think that nearly enough&#10;attention is being given to this aspect of the matter.  At present the&#10;planet Mars is in conjunction, but with every return to opposition I,&#10;for one, anticipate a renewal of their adventure.  In any case, we&#10;should be prepared.  It seems to me that it should be possible to&#10;define the position of the gun from which the shots are discharged, to&#10;keep a sustained watch upon this part of the planet, and to anticipate&#10;the arrival of the next attack.&#10;&#10;In that case the cylinder might be destroyed with dynamite or&#10;artillery before it was sufficiently cool for the Martians to emerge,&#10;or they might be butchered by means of guns so soon as the screw&#10;opened.  It seems to me that they have lost a vast advantage in the&#10;failure of their first surprise.  Possibly they see it in the same&#10;light.&#10;&#10;Lessing has advanced excellent reasons for supposing that the&#10;Martians have actually succeeded in effecting a landing on the planet&#10;Venus.  Seven months ago now, Venus and Mars were in alignment with&#10;the sun; that is to say, Mars was in opposition from the point of view&#10;of an observer on Venus.  Subsequently a peculiar luminous and sinuous&#10;marking appeared on the unillumined half of the inner planet, and&#10;almost simultaneously a faint dark mark of a similar sinuous character&#10;was detected upon a photograph of the Martian disk.  One needs to see&#10;the drawings of these appearances in order to appreciate fully their&#10;remarkable resemblance in character.&#10;&#10;At any rate, whether we expect another invasion or not, our views&#10;of the human future must be greatly modified by these events.  We have&#10;learned now that we cannot regard this planet as being fenced in and a&#10;secure abiding place for Man; we can never anticipate the unseen good&#10;or evil that may come upon us suddenly out of space.  It may be that&#10;in the larger design of the universe this invasion from Mars is not&#10;without its ultimate benefit for men; it has robbed us of that serene&#10;confidence in the future which is the most fruitful source of&#10;decadence, the gifts to human science it has brought are enormous, and&#10;it has done much to promote the conception of the commonweal of&#10;mankind.  It may be that across the immensity of space the Martians&#10;have watched the fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned their&#10;lesson, and that on the planet Venus they have found a securer&#10;settlement.  Be that as it may, for many years yet there will&#10;certainly be no relaxation of the eager scrutiny of the Martian disk,&#10;and those fiery darts of the sky, the shooting stars, will bring with&#10;them as they fall an unavoidable apprehension to all the sons of men.&#10;&#10;The broadening of men's views that has resulted can scarcely be&#10;exaggerated.  Before the cylinder fell there was a general persuasion&#10;that through all the deep of space no life existed beyond the petty&#10;surface of our minute sphere.  Now we see further.  If the Martians&#10;can reach Venus, there is no reason to suppose that the thing is&#10;impossible for men, and when the slow cooling of the sun makes this&#10;earth uninhabitable, as at last it must do, it may be that the thread&#10;of life that has begun here will have streamed out and caught our&#10;sister planet within its toils.&#10;&#10;Dim and wonderful is the vision I have conjured up in my mind of&#10;life spreading slowly from this little seed bed of the solar system&#10;throughout the inanimate vastness of sidereal space.  But that is a&#10;remote dream.  It may be, on the other hand, that the destruction of&#10;the Martians is only a reprieve.  To them, and not to us, perhaps, is&#10;the future ordained.&#10;&#10;I must confess the stress and danger of the time have left an&#10;abiding sense of doubt and insecurity in my mind.  I sit in my study&#10;writing by lamplight, and suddenly I see again the healing valley&#10;below set with writhing flames, and feel the house behind and about me&#10;empty and desolate.  I go out into the Byfleet Road, and vehicles pass&#10;me, a butcher boy in a cart, a cabful of visitors, a workman on a&#10;bicycle, children going to school, and suddenly they become vague and&#10;unreal, and I hurry again with the artilleryman through the hot,&#10;brooding silence.  Of a night I see the black powder darkening the&#10;silent streets, and the contorted bodies shrouded in that layer; they&#10;rise upon me tattered and dog-bitten.  They gibber and grow fiercer,&#10;paler, uglier, mad distortions of humanity at last, and I wake, cold&#10;and wretched, in the darkness of the night.&#10;&#10;I go to London and see the busy multitudes in Fleet Street and the&#10;Strand, and it comes across my mind that they are but the ghosts of&#10;the past, haunting the streets that I have seen silent and wretched,&#10;going to and fro, phantasms in a dead city, the mockery of life in a&#10;galvanised body.  And strange, too, it is to stand on Primrose Hill,&#10;as I did but a day before writing this last chapter, to see the great&#10;province of houses, dim and blue through the haze of the smoke and&#10;mist, vanishing at last into the vague lower sky, to see the people&#10;walking to and fro among the flower beds on the hill, to see the&#10;sight-seers about the Martian machine that stands there still, to hear&#10;the tumult of playing children, and to recall the time when I saw it&#10;all bright and clear-cut, hard and silent, under the dawn of that last&#10;great day. . . .&#10;&#10;And strangest of all is it to hold my wife's hand again, and to think&#10;that I have counted her, and that she has counted me, among the dead.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The War of the Worlds, by H.

Contact the&#10;Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.&#10;&#10;1.F.&#10;&#10;1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable&#10;effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread&#10;public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm&#10;collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic&#10;works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain&#10;&quot;Defects,&quot; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or&#10;corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual&#10;property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a&#10;computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by&#10;your equipment.&#10;&#10;1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &quot;Right&#10;of Replacement or Refund&quot; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project&#10;Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project&#10;Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project&#10;Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all&#10;liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal&#10;fees.

INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the&#10;trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone&#10;providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance&#10;with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,&#10;promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,&#10;harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,&#10;that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do&#10;or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm&#10;work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any&#10;Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.&#10;&#10;&#10;Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm&#10;&#10;Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of&#10;electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers&#10;including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists&#10;because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from&#10;people in all walks of life.&#10;&#10;Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the&#10;assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's&#10;goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will&#10;remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project&#10;Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure&#10;and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.&#10;To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation&#10;and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4&#10;and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.&#10;&#10;&#10;Section 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg&#10;Literary Archive Foundation&#10;&#10;Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide&#10;spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of&#10;increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be&#10;freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest&#10;array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations&#10;($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt&#10;status with the IRS.&#10;&#10;The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating&#10;charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United&#10;States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a&#10;considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up&#10;with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations&#10;where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To&#10;SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any&#10;particular state visit http://pglaf.org&#10;&#10;While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we&#10;have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition&#10;against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who&#10;approach us with offers to donate.&#10;&#10;International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make&#10;any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from&#10;outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.&#10;&#10;Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation&#10;methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other&#10;ways including including checks, online payments and credit card&#10;donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate&#10;&#10;&#10;Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic&#10;works.&#10;&#10;Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm&#10;concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared&#10;with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project&#10;Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.&#10;&#10;Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed&#10;editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.&#10;unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily&#10;keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.&#10;&#10;Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:&#10;&#10;     http://www.gutenberg.net&#10;&#10;This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,&#10;including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary&#10;Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to&#10;subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.&#10;" creationDate="2022-12-21T10:51:41.162301" fileFormat="GUTEMBERG" fileName="WellsWarofTheWorlds.txt.gut" filePath="/home/biel/Documents/Q5/PROP/subgrup-prop33.2/data/novels/WellsWarofTheWorlds.txt.gut" modificationDate="2022-12-21T10:51:41.162301" title="The War of the Worlds"/>

G. Wells [1898]&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;I&#10;&#10;&#10;The Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him)&#10;was expounding a recondite matter to us. His grey eyes shone and&#10;twinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The&#10;fire burned brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent&#10;lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and&#10;passed in our glasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and&#10;caressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that&#10;luxurious after-dinner atmosphere when thought roams gracefully&#10;free of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in this&#10;way--marking the points with a lean forefinger--as we sat and lazily&#10;admired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it)&#10;and his fecundity.&#10;&#10;'You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two&#10;ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for&#10;instance, they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.'&#10;&#10;'Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?' &#10;said Filby, an argumentative person with red hair.&#10;&#10;'I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable&#10;ground for it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You&#10;know of course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness _nil_,&#10;has no real existence. They taught you that? Neither has a&#10;mathematical plane. These things are mere abstractions.'&#10;&#10;'That is all right,' said the Psychologist.&#10;&#10;'Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a&#10;real existence.'&#10;&#10;'There I object,' said Filby. 'Of course a solid body may exist. All&#10;real things--'&#10;&#10;'So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an _instantaneous_&#10;cube exist?'&#10;&#10;'Don't follow you,' said Filby.&#10;&#10;'Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real&#10;existence?'&#10;&#10;Filby became pensive. 'Clearly,' the Time Traveller proceeded, 'any&#10;real body must have extension in _four_ directions: it must have&#10;Length, Breadth, Thickness, and--Duration. But through a natural&#10;infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we&#10;incline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions,&#10;three which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time.&#10;There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between&#10;the former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that&#10;our consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the&#10;latter from the beginning to the end of our lives.'&#10;&#10;'That,' said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight&#10;his cigar over the lamp; 'that ... very clear indeed.'&#10;&#10;'Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,'&#10;continued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of&#10;cheerfulness. 'Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension,&#10;though some people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know&#10;they mean it. It is only another way of looking at Time. _There is&#10;no difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space&#10;except that our consciousness moves along it_. But some foolish&#10;people have got hold of the wrong side of that idea. You have all&#10;heard what they have to say about this Fourth Dimension?'&#10;&#10;'_I_ have not,' said the Provincial Mayor.&#10;&#10;'It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is&#10;spoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length,&#10;Breadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to&#10;three planes, each at right angles to the others. But some&#10;philosophical people have been asking why _three_ dimensions&#10;particularly--why not another direction at right angles to the other&#10;three?--and have even tried to construct a Four-Dimension geometry.&#10;Professor Simon Newcomb was expounding this to the New York&#10;Mathematical Society only a month or so ago. You know how on a flat&#10;surface, which has only two dimensions, we can represent a figure of&#10;a three-dimensional solid, and similarly they think that by models&#10;of three dimensions they could represent one of four--if they could&#10;master the perspective of the thing. See?'&#10;&#10;'I think so,' murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his&#10;brows, he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one&#10;who repeats mystic words. 'Yes, I think I see it now,' he said after&#10;some time, brightening in a quite transitory manner.&#10;&#10;'Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this&#10;geometry of Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results&#10;are curious. For instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight&#10;years old, another at fifteen, another at seventeen, another at&#10;twenty-three, and so on. All these are evidently sections, as it&#10;were, Three-Dimensional representations of his Four-Dimensioned&#10;being, which is a fixed and unalterable thing.&#10;&#10;'Scientific people,' proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause&#10;required for the proper assimilation of this, 'know very well that&#10;Time is only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram,&#10;a weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the&#10;movement of the barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night&#10;it fell, then this morning it rose again, and so gently upward to&#10;here. Surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of the&#10;dimensions of Space generally recognized? But certainly it traced&#10;such a line, and that line, therefore, we must conclude was along&#10;the Time-Dimension.'&#10;&#10;'But,' said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, 'if&#10;Time is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why&#10;has it always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot&#10;we move in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?'&#10;&#10;The Time Traveller smiled. 'Are you sure we can move freely in&#10;Space? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough,&#10;and men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two&#10;dimensions. But how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.'&#10;&#10;'Not exactly,' said the Medical Man. 'There are balloons.'&#10;&#10;'But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the&#10;inequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical&#10;movement.'&#10;&#10;'Still they could move a little up and down,' said the Medical Man.&#10;&#10;'Easier, far easier down than up.'&#10;&#10;'And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the&#10;present moment.'&#10;&#10;'My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where&#10;the whole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the&#10;present moment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have&#10;no dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform&#10;velocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel _down_&#10;if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth's surface.'&#10;&#10;'But the great difficulty is this,' interrupted the Psychologist.&#10;'You _can_ move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot&#10;move about in Time.'&#10;&#10;'That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say&#10;that we cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling&#10;an incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence:&#10;I become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of&#10;course we have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any&#10;more than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the&#10;ground. But a civilized man is better off than the savage in this&#10;respect. He can go up against gravitation in a balloon, and why&#10;should he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or&#10;accelerate his drift along the Time-Dimension, or even turn about&#10;and travel the other way?'&#10;&#10;'Oh, _this_,' began Filby, 'is all--'&#10;&#10;'Why not?' said the Time Traveller.&#10;&#10;'It's against reason,' said Filby.&#10;&#10;'What reason?' said the Time Traveller.&#10;&#10;'You can show black is white by argument,' said Filby, 'but you will&#10;never convince me.'&#10;&#10;'Possibly not,' said the Time Traveller. 'But now you begin to see&#10;the object of my investigations into the geometry of Four&#10;Dimensions. Long ago I had a vague inkling of a machine--'&#10;&#10;'To travel through Time!' exclaimed the Very Young Man.&#10;&#10;'That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time,&#10;as the driver determines.'&#10;&#10;Filby contented himself with laughter.&#10;&#10;'But I have experimental verification,' said the Time Traveller.&#10;&#10;'It would be remarkably convenient for the historian,' the&#10;Psychologist suggested. 'One might travel back and verify the&#10;accepted account of the Battle of Hastings, for instance!'&#10;&#10;'Don't you think you would attract attention?' said the Medical Man.&#10;'Our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.'&#10;&#10;'One might get one's Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,'&#10;the Very Young Man thought.&#10;&#10;'In which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go.&#10;The German scholars have improved Greek so much.'&#10;&#10;'Then there is the future,' said the Very Young Man. 'Just think!&#10;One might invest all one's money, leave it to accumulate at&#10;interest, and hurry on ahead!'&#10;&#10;'To discover a society,' said I, 'erected on a strictly communistic&#10;basis.'&#10;&#10;'Of all the wild extravagant theories!' began the Psychologist.&#10;&#10;'Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until--'&#10;&#10;'Experimental verification!' cried I. 'You are going to verify&#10;_that_?'&#10;&#10;'The experiment!' cried Filby, who was getting brain-weary.&#10;&#10;'Let's see your experiment anyhow,' said the Psychologist, 'though&#10;it's all humbug, you know.'&#10;&#10;The Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly,&#10;and with his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly&#10;out of the room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long&#10;passage to his laboratory.&#10;&#10;The Psychologist looked at us. 'I wonder what he's got?'&#10;&#10;'Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,' said the Medical Man, and&#10;Filby tried to tell us about a conjurer he had seen at Burslem; but&#10;before he had finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and&#10;Filby's anecdote collapsed.&#10;&#10;The thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering&#10;metallic framework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very&#10;delicately made. There was ivory in it, and some transparent&#10;crystalline substance. And now I must be explicit, for this that&#10;follows--unless his explanation is to be accepted--is an absolutely&#10;unaccountable thing. He took one of the small octagonal tables that&#10;were scattered about the room, and set it in front of the fire, with&#10;two legs on the hearthrug. On this table he placed the mechanism.&#10;Then he drew up a chair, and sat down. The only other object on the&#10;table was a small shaded lamp, the bright light of which fell upon&#10;the model. There were also perhaps a dozen candles about, two in&#10;brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces, so that&#10;the room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat in a low arm-chair&#10;nearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to be almost between&#10;the Time Traveller and the fireplace. Filby sat behind him, looking&#10;over his shoulder. The Medical Man and the Provincial Mayor watched&#10;him in profile from the right, the Psychologist from the left. The&#10;Very Young Man stood behind the Psychologist. We were all on the&#10;alert. It appears incredible to me that any kind of trick, however&#10;subtly conceived and however adroitly done, could have been played&#10;upon us under these conditions.&#10;&#10;The Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism. 'Well?'&#10;said the Psychologist.&#10;&#10;'This little affair,' said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows&#10;upon the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus,&#10;'is only a model. It is my plan for a machine to travel through&#10;time. You will notice that it looks singularly askew, and that there&#10;is an odd twinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in&#10;some way unreal.' He pointed to the part with his finger. 'Also,&#10;here is one little white lever, and here is another.'&#10;&#10;The Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing.&#10;'It's beautifully made,' he said.&#10;&#10;'It took two years to make,' retorted the Time Traveller. Then, when&#10;we had all imitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: 'Now I&#10;want you clearly to understand that this lever, being pressed over,&#10;sends the machine gliding into the future, and this other reverses&#10;the motion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller.&#10;Presently I am going to press the lever, and off the machine will&#10;go. It will vanish, pass into future Time, and disappear. Have a&#10;good look at the thing. Look at the table too, and satisfy&#10;yourselves there is no trickery. I don't want to waste this model,&#10;and then be told I'm a quack.'&#10;&#10;There was a minute's pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about to&#10;speak to me, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forth&#10;his finger towards the lever. 'No,' he said suddenly. 'Lend me your&#10;hand.' And turning to the Psychologist, he took that individual's&#10;hand in his own and told him to put out his forefinger. So that it&#10;was the Psychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine&#10;on its interminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I am&#10;absolutely certain there was no trickery. There was a breath of&#10;wind, and the lamp flame jumped. One of the candles on the mantel&#10;was blown out, and the little machine suddenly swung round, became&#10;indistinct, was seen as a ghost for a second perhaps, as an eddy of&#10;faintly glittering brass and ivory; and it was gone--vanished! Save&#10;for the lamp the table was bare.&#10;&#10;Everyone was silent for a minute. Then Filby said he was damned.&#10;&#10;The Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked&#10;under the table. At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully.&#10;'Well?' he said, with a reminiscence of the Psychologist. Then,&#10;getting up, he went to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and with his&#10;back to us began to fill his pipe.&#10;&#10;We stared at each other. 'Look here,' said the Medical Man, 'are you&#10;in earnest about this? Do you seriously believe that that machine&#10;has travelled into time?'&#10;&#10;'Certainly,' said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a spill at&#10;the fire. Then he turned, lighting his pipe, to look at the&#10;Psychologist's face. (The Psychologist, to show that he was not&#10;unhinged, helped himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut.)&#10;'What is more, I have a big machine nearly finished in there'--he&#10;indicated the laboratory--'and when that is put together I mean to&#10;have a journey on my own account.'&#10;&#10;'You mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?'&#10;said Filby.&#10;&#10;'Into the future or the past--I don't, for certain, know which.'&#10;&#10;After an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration. 'It must have&#10;gone into the past if it has gone anywhere,' he said.&#10;&#10;'Why?' said the Time Traveller.&#10;&#10;'Because I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it&#10;travelled into the future it would still be here all this time,&#10;since it must have travelled through this time.'&#10;&#10;'But,' I said, 'If it travelled into the past it would have been&#10;visible when we came first into this room; and last Thursday when we&#10;were here; and the Thursday before that; and so forth!'&#10;&#10;'Serious objections,' remarked the Provincial Mayor, with an air of&#10;impartiality, turning towards the Time Traveller.&#10;&#10;'Not a bit,' said the Time Traveller, and, to the Psychologist: 'You&#10;think. You can explain that. It's presentation below the threshold,&#10;you know, diluted presentation.'&#10;&#10;'Of course,' said the Psychologist, and reassured us. 'That's a&#10;simple point of psychology. I should have thought of it. It's plain&#10;enough, and helps the paradox delightfully. We cannot see it, nor&#10;can we appreciate this machine, any more than we can the spoke of&#10;a wheel spinning, or a bullet flying through the air. If it is&#10;travelling through time fifty times or a hundred times faster than&#10;we are, if it gets through a minute while we get through a second,&#10;the impression it creates will of course be only one-fiftieth or&#10;one-hundredth of what it would make if it were not travelling in&#10;time. That's plain enough.' He passed his hand through the space in&#10;which the machine had been. 'You see?' he said, laughing.&#10;&#10;We sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so. Then the&#10;Time Traveller asked us what we thought of it all.&#10;&#10;'It sounds plausible enough to-night,' said the Medical Man; 'but&#10;wait until to-morrow. Wait for the common sense of the morning.'&#10;&#10;'Would you like to see the Time Machine itself?' asked the Time&#10;Traveller. And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the&#10;way down the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory. I remember&#10;vividly the flickering light, his queer, broad head in silhouette,&#10;the dance of the shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but&#10;incredulous, and how there in the laboratory we beheld a larger&#10;edition of the little mechanism which we had seen vanish from before&#10;our eyes. Parts were of nickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainly&#10;been filed or sawn out of rock crystal. The thing was generally&#10;complete, but the twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the&#10;bench beside some sheets of drawings, and I took one up for a better&#10;look at it. Quartz it seemed to be.&#10;&#10;'Look here,' said the Medical Man, 'are you perfectly serious?&#10;Or is this a trick--like that ghost you showed us last Christmas?'&#10;&#10;'Upon that machine,' said the Time Traveller, holding the lamp&#10;aloft, 'I intend to explore time. Is that plain? I was never more&#10;serious in my life.'&#10;&#10;None of us quite knew how to take it.&#10;&#10;I caught Filby's eye over the shoulder of the Medical Man, and he&#10;winked at me solemnly.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;II&#10;&#10;&#10;I think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time&#10;Machine. The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who&#10;are too clever to be believed: you never felt that you saw all round&#10;him; you always suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in&#10;ambush, behind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and&#10;explained the matter in the Time Traveller's words, we should have&#10;shown _him_ far less scepticism. For we should have perceived his&#10;motives; a pork butcher could understand Filby. But the Time&#10;Traveller had more than a touch of whim among his elements, and we&#10;distrusted him. Things that would have made the frame of a less&#10;clever man seemed tricks in his hands. It is a mistake to do things&#10;too easily. The serious people who took him seriously never felt&#10;quite sure of his deportment; they were somehow aware that trusting&#10;their reputations for judgment with him was like furnishing a&#10;nursery with egg-shell china. So I don't think any of us said very&#10;much about time travelling in the interval between that Thursday and&#10;the next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in most of&#10;our minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical incredibleness,&#10;the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion it&#10;suggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied with the&#10;trick of the model. That I remember discussing with the Medical Man,&#10;whom I met on Friday at the Linnaean. He said he had seen a similar&#10;thing at Tubingen, and laid considerable stress on the blowing out&#10;of the candle. But how the trick was done he could not explain.&#10;&#10;The next Thursday I went again to Richmond--I suppose I was one of&#10;the Time Traveller's most constant guests--and, arriving late, found&#10;four or five men already assembled in his drawing-room. The Medical&#10;Man was standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand&#10;and his watch in the other. I looked round for the Time Traveller,&#10;and--'It's half-past seven now,' said the Medical Man. 'I suppose&#10;we'd better have dinner?'&#10;&#10;'Where's----?' said I, naming our host.&#10;&#10;'You've just come? It's rather odd. He's unavoidably detained. He&#10;asks me in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he's not&#10;back. Says he'll explain when he comes.'&#10;&#10;'It seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,' said the Editor of a&#10;well-known daily paper; and thereupon the Doctor rang the bell.&#10;&#10;The Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and myself&#10;who had attended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank, the&#10;Editor aforementioned, a certain journalist, and another--a quiet,&#10;shy man with a beard--whom I didn't know, and who, as far as my&#10;observation went, never opened his mouth all the evening. There was&#10;some speculation at the dinner-table about the Time Traveller's&#10;absence, and I suggested time travelling, in a half-jocular spirit.&#10;The Editor wanted that explained to him, and the Psychologist&#10;volunteered a wooden account of the 'ingenious paradox and trick' we&#10;had witnessed that day week. He was in the midst of his exposition&#10;when the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise. I&#10;was facing the door, and saw it first. 'Hallo!' I said. 'At last!'&#10;And the door opened wider, and the Time Traveller stood before us.&#10;I gave a cry of surprise. 'Good heavens! man, what's the matter?'&#10;cried the Medical Man, who saw him next. And the whole tableful&#10;turned towards the door.&#10;&#10;He was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and&#10;smeared with green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it&#10;seemed to me greyer--either with dust and dirt or because its colour&#10;had actually faded. His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown&#10;cut on it--a cut half healed; his expression was haggard and drawn,&#10;as by intense suffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway,&#10;as if he had been dazzled by the light. Then he came into the room.&#10;He walked with just such a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps.&#10;We stared at him in silence, expecting him to speak.&#10;&#10;He said not a word, but came painfully to the table, and made a&#10;motion towards the wine. The Editor filled a glass of champagne, and&#10;pushed it towards him. He drained it, and it seemed to do him good:&#10;for he looked round the table, and the ghost of his old smile&#10;flickered across his face. 'What on earth have you been up to, man?'&#10;said the Doctor. The Time Traveller did not seem to hear. 'Don't let&#10;me disturb you,' he said, with a certain faltering articulation.&#10;'I'm all right.' He stopped, held out his glass for more, and took&#10;it off at a draught. 'That's good,' he said. His eyes grew brighter,&#10;and a faint colour came into his cheeks. His glance flickered over&#10;our faces with a certain dull approval, and then went round the warm&#10;and comfortable room. Then he spoke again, still as it were feeling&#10;his way among his words. 'I'm going to wash and dress, and then I'll&#10;come down and explain things ... Save me some of that mutton. I'm&#10;starving for a bit of meat.'&#10;&#10;He looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, and hoped he&#10;was all right. The Editor began a question. 'Tell you presently,'&#10;said the Time Traveller. 'I'm--funny! Be all right in a minute.'&#10;&#10;He put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again&#10;I remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall,&#10;and standing up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out. He had&#10;nothing on them but a pair of tattered, blood-stained socks. Then the&#10;door closed upon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered&#10;how he detested any fuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my&#10;mind was wool-gathering. Then, 'Remarkable Behaviour of an Eminent&#10;Scientist,' I heard the Editor say, thinking (after his wont) in&#10;headlines. And this brought my attention back to the bright&#10;dinner-table.&#10;&#10;'What's the game?' said the Journalist. 'Has he been doing the&#10;Amateur Cadger? I don't follow.' I met the eye of the Psychologist,&#10;and read my own interpretation in his face. I thought of the Time&#10;Traveller limping painfully upstairs. I don't think any one else had&#10;noticed his lameness.&#10;&#10;The first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical&#10;Man, who rang the bell--the Time Traveller hated to have servants&#10;waiting at dinner--for a hot plate. At that the Editor turned to his&#10;knife and fork with a grunt, and the Silent Man followed suit. The&#10;dinner was resumed. Conversation was exclamatory for a little while,&#10;with gaps of wonderment; and then the Editor got fervent in his&#10;curiosity. 'Does our friend eke out his modest income with a&#10;crossing? or has he his Nebuchadnezzar phases?' he inquired. 'I feel&#10;assured it's this business of the Time Machine,' I said, and took up&#10;the Psychologist's account of our previous meeting. The new guests&#10;were frankly incredulous. The Editor raised objections. 'What _was_&#10;this time travelling? A man couldn't cover himself with dust by&#10;rolling in a paradox, could he?' And then, as the idea came home to&#10;him, he resorted to caricature. Hadn't they any clothes-brushes in&#10;the Future? The Journalist too, would not believe at any price, and&#10;joined the Editor in the easy work of heaping ridicule on the whole&#10;thing. They were both the new kind of journalist--very joyous,&#10;irreverent young men. 'Our Special Correspondent in the Day&#10;after To-morrow reports,' the Journalist was saying--or rather&#10;shouting--when the Time Traveller came back. He was dressed in&#10;ordinary evening clothes, and nothing save his haggard look remained&#10;of the change that had startled me.&#10;&#10;'I say,' said the Editor hilariously, 'these chaps here say you have&#10;been travelling into the middle of next week! Tell us all about&#10;little Rosebery, will you? What will you take for the lot?'&#10;&#10;The Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without a&#10;word. He smiled quietly, in his old way. 'Where's my mutton?' he&#10;said. 'What a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again!'&#10;&#10;'Story!' cried the Editor.&#10;&#10;'Story be damned!' said the Time Traveller. 'I want something to&#10;eat. I won't say a word until I get some peptone into my arteries.&#10;Thanks. And the salt.'&#10;&#10;'One word,' said I. 'Have you been time travelling?'&#10;&#10;'Yes,' said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding his&#10;head.&#10;&#10;'I'd give a shilling a line for a verbatim note,' said the Editor.&#10;The Time Traveller pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rang&#10;it with his fingernail; at which the Silent Man, who had been&#10;staring at his face, started convulsively, and poured him wine.&#10;The rest of the dinner was uncomfortable. For my own part, sudden&#10;questions kept on rising to my lips, and I dare say it was the same&#10;with the others. The Journalist tried to relieve the tension by&#10;telling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. The Time Traveller devoted his&#10;attention to his dinner, and displayed the appetite of a tramp.&#10;The Medical Man smoked a cigarette, and watched the Time Traveller&#10;through his eyelashes. The Silent Man seemed even more clumsy than&#10;usual, and drank champagne with regularity and determination out of&#10;sheer nervousness. At last the Time Traveller pushed his plate away,&#10;and looked round us. 'I suppose I must apologize,' he said. 'I was&#10;simply starving. I've had a most amazing time.' He reached out his&#10;hand for a cigar, and cut the end. 'But come into the smoking-room.&#10;It's too long a story to tell over greasy plates.' And ringing the&#10;bell in passing, he led the way into the adjoining room.&#10;&#10;'You have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?' he&#10;said to me, leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new&#10;guests.&#10;&#10;'But the thing's a mere paradox,' said the Editor.&#10;&#10;'I can't argue to-night. I don't mind telling you the story, but&#10;I can't argue. I will,' he went on, 'tell you the story of what&#10;has happened to me, if you like, but you must refrain from&#10;interruptions. I want to tell it. Badly. Most of it will sound like&#10;lying. So be it! It's true--every word of it, all the same. I was in&#10;my laboratory at four o'clock, and since then ... I've lived eight&#10;days ... such days as no human being ever lived before! I'm nearly&#10;worn out, but I shan't sleep till I've told this thing over to you.&#10;Then I shall go to bed. But no interruptions! Is it agreed?'&#10;&#10;'Agreed,' said the Editor, and the rest of us echoed 'Agreed.' And&#10;with that the Time Traveller began his story as I have set it forth.&#10;He sat back in his chair at first, and spoke like a weary man.&#10;Afterwards he got more animated. In writing it down I feel with only&#10;too much keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink--and, above all, my&#10;own inadequacy--to express its quality. You read, I will suppose,&#10;attentively enough; but you cannot see the speaker's white,&#10;sincere face in the bright circle of the little lamp, nor hear the&#10;intonation of his voice. You cannot know how his expression followed&#10;the turns of his story! Most of us hearers were in shadow, for the&#10;candles in the smoking-room had not been lighted, and only the face&#10;of the Journalist and the legs of the Silent Man from the knees&#10;downward were illuminated. At first we glanced now and again at each&#10;other. After a time we ceased to do that, and looked only at the&#10;Time Traveller's face.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;III&#10;&#10;&#10;'I told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the Time&#10;Machine, and showed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in the&#10;workshop. There it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one of&#10;the ivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest of&#10;it's sound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday, but on Friday,&#10;when the putting together was nearly done, I found that one of the&#10;nickel bars was exactly one inch too short, and this I had to get&#10;remade; so that the thing was not complete until this morning. It&#10;was at ten o'clock to-day that the first of all Time Machines began&#10;its career. I gave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put&#10;one more drop of oil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in the&#10;saddle. I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels&#10;much the same wonder at what will come next as I felt then. I took&#10;the starting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other,&#10;pressed the first, and almost immediately the second. I seemed to&#10;reel; I felt a nightmare sensation of falling; and, looking round,&#10;I saw the laboratory exactly as before. Had anything happened? For&#10;a moment I suspected that my intellect had tricked me. Then I noted&#10;the clock. A moment before, as it seemed, it had stood at a minute&#10;or so past ten; now it was nearly half-past three!&#10;&#10;'I drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both&#10;hands, and went off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went&#10;dark. Mrs. Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing&#10;me, towards the garden door. I suppose it took her a minute or so to&#10;traverse the place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room&#10;like a rocket. I pressed the lever over to its extreme position. The&#10;night came like the turning out of a lamp, and in another moment&#10;came to-morrow. The laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter&#10;and ever fainter. To-morrow night came black, then day again, night&#10;again, day again, faster and faster still. An eddying murmur filled&#10;my ears, and a strange, dumb confusedness descended on my mind.&#10;&#10;'I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time&#10;travelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling&#10;exactly like that one has upon a switchback--of a helpless headlong&#10;motion! I felt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent&#10;smash. As I put on pace, night followed day like the flapping of a&#10;black wing. The dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to&#10;fall away from me, and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky,&#10;leaping it every minute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed&#10;the laboratory had been destroyed and I had come into the open air.&#10;I had a dim impression of scaffolding, but I was already going too&#10;fast to be conscious of any moving things. The slowest snail that&#10;ever crawled dashed by too fast for me. The twinkling succession of&#10;darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye. Then, in the&#10;intermittent darknesses, I saw the moon spinning swiftly through her&#10;quarters from new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the circling&#10;stars. Presently, as I went on, still gaining velocity, the&#10;palpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness;&#10;the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a splendid luminous&#10;color like that of early twilight; the jerking sun became a streak&#10;of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter fluctuating&#10;band; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now and then a&#10;brighter circle flickering in the blue.&#10;&#10;'The landscape was misty and vague. I was still on the hill-side&#10;upon which this house now stands, and the shoulder rose above me&#10;grey and dim. I saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour,&#10;now brown, now green; they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away.&#10;I saw huge buildings rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams.&#10;The whole surface of the earth seemed changed--melting and flowing&#10;under my eyes. The little hands upon the dials that registered my&#10;speed raced round faster and faster. Presently I noted that the sun&#10;belt swayed up and down, from solstice to solstice, in a minute or&#10;less, and that consequently my pace was over a year a minute; and&#10;minute by minute the white snow flashed across the world, and&#10;vanished, and was followed by the bright, brief green of spring.&#10;&#10;'The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now. They&#10;merged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked&#10;indeed a clumsy swaying of the machine, for which I was unable to&#10;account. But my mind was too confused to attend to it, so with a&#10;kind of madness growing upon me, I flung myself into futurity. At&#10;first I scarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything but&#10;these new sensations. But presently a fresh series of impressions&#10;grew up in my mind--a certain curiosity and therewith a certain&#10;dread--until at last they took complete possession of me. What&#10;strange developments of humanity, what wonderful advances upon our&#10;rudimentary civilization, I thought, might not appear when I came to&#10;look nearly into the dim elusive world that raced and fluctuated&#10;before my eyes! I saw great and splendid architecture rising about&#10;me, more massive than any buildings of our own time, and yet, as it&#10;seemed, built of glimmer and mist. I saw a richer green flow up the&#10;hill-side, and remain there, without any wintry intermission. Even&#10;through the veil of my confusion the earth seemed very fair. And so&#10;my mind came round to the business of stopping.&#10;&#10;'The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some&#10;substance in the space which I, or the machine, occupied. So long&#10;as I travelled at a high velocity through time, this scarcely&#10;mattered; I was, so to speak, attenuated--was slipping like a vapour&#10;through the interstices of intervening substances! But to come to&#10;a stop involved the jamming of myself, molecule by molecule, into&#10;whatever lay in my way; meant bringing my atoms into such intimate&#10;contact with those of the obstacle that a profound chemical&#10;reaction--possibly a far-reaching explosion--would result, and blow&#10;myself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions--into the&#10;Unknown. This possibility had occurred to me again and again while I&#10;was making the machine; but then I had cheerfully accepted it as an&#10;unavoidable risk--one of the risks a man has got to take! Now the&#10;risk was inevitable, I no longer saw it in the same cheerful light.&#10;The fact is that, insensibly, the absolute strangeness of everything,&#10;the sickly jarring and swaying of the machine, above all, the&#10;feeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely upset my nerve. I told&#10;myself that I could never stop, and with a gust of petulance I&#10;resolved to stop forthwith. Like an impatient fool, I lugged over&#10;the lever, and incontinently the thing went reeling over, and I was&#10;flung headlong through the air.&#10;&#10;'There was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears. I may have&#10;been stunned for a moment. A pitiless hail was hissing round me,&#10;and I was sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine.&#10;Everything still seemed grey, but presently I remarked that the&#10;confusion in my ears was gone. I looked round me. I was on what&#10;seemed to be a little lawn in a garden, surrounded by rhododendron&#10;bushes, and I noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms were&#10;dropping in a shower under the beating of the hail-stones. The&#10;rebounding, dancing hail hung in a cloud over the machine, and drove&#10;along the ground like smoke. In a moment I was wet to the skin.&#10;&quot;Fine hospitality,&quot; said I, &quot;to a man who has travelled innumerable&#10;years to see you.&quot;&#10;&#10;'Presently I thought what a fool I was to get wet. I stood up and&#10;looked round me. A colossal figure, carved apparently in some white&#10;stone, loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy&#10;downpour. But all else of the world was invisible.&#10;&#10;'My sensations would be hard to describe. As the columns of hail&#10;grew thinner, I saw the white figure more distinctly. It was very&#10;large, for a silver birch-tree touched its shoulder. It was of white&#10;marble, in shape something like a winged sphinx, but the wings,&#10;instead of being carried vertically at the sides, were spread so&#10;that it seemed to hover. The pedestal, it appeared to me, was of&#10;bronze, and was thick with verdigris. It chanced that the face was&#10;towards me; the sightless eyes seemed to watch me; there was the&#10;faint shadow of a smile on the lips. It was greatly weather-worn,&#10;and that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease. I stood&#10;looking at it for a little space--half a minute, perhaps, or half an&#10;hour. It seemed to advance and to recede as the hail drove before it&#10;denser or thinner. At last I tore my eyes from it for a moment and&#10;saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare, and that the sky was&#10;lightening with the promise of the sun.&#10;&#10;'I looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the full&#10;temerity of my voyage came suddenly upon me. What might appear when&#10;that hazy curtain was altogether withdrawn? What might not have&#10;happened to men? What if cruelty had grown into a common passion?&#10;What if in this interval the race had lost its manliness and had&#10;developed into something inhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly&#10;powerful? I might seem some old-world savage animal, only the more&#10;dreadful and disgusting for our common likeness--a foul creature to&#10;be incontinently slain.&#10;&#10;'Already I saw other vast shapes--huge buildings with intricate&#10;parapets and tall columns, with a wooded hill-side dimly creeping&#10;in upon me through the lessening storm. I was seized with a panic&#10;fear. I turned frantically to the Time Machine, and strove hard to&#10;readjust it. As I did so the shafts of the sun smote through the&#10;thunderstorm. The grey downpour was swept aside and vanished like&#10;the trailing garments of a ghost. Above me, in the intense blue&#10;of the summer sky, some faint brown shreds of cloud whirled into&#10;nothingness. The great buildings about me stood out clear and&#10;distinct, shining with the wet of the thunderstorm, and picked out&#10;in white by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses. I&#10;felt naked in a strange world. I felt as perhaps a bird may feel in&#10;the clear air, knowing the hawk wings above and will swoop. My fear&#10;grew to frenzy. I took a breathing space, set my teeth, and again&#10;grappled fiercely, wrist and knee, with the machine. It gave under&#10;my desperate onset and turned over. It struck my chin violently. One&#10;hand on the saddle, the other on the lever, I stood panting heavily&#10;in attitude to mount again.&#10;&#10;'But with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered. I&#10;looked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote&#10;future. In a circular opening, high up in the wall of the nearer&#10;house, I saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes. They had&#10;seen me, and their faces were directed towards me.&#10;&#10;'Then I heard voices approaching me. Coming through the bushes by&#10;the White Sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running. One of&#10;these emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon&#10;which I stood with my machine. He was a slight creature--perhaps&#10;four feet high--clad in a purple tunic, girdled at the waist with a&#10;leather belt. Sandals or buskins--I could not clearly distinguish&#10;which--were on his feet; his legs were bare to the knees, and his&#10;head was bare. Noticing that, I noticed for the first time how warm&#10;the air was.&#10;&#10;'He struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, but&#10;indescribably frail. His flushed face reminded me of the more&#10;beautiful kind of consumptive--that hectic beauty of which we used&#10;to hear so much. At the sight of him I suddenly regained confidence.&#10;I took my hands from the machine.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;IV&#10;&#10;&#10;'In another moment we were standing face to face, I and this fragile&#10;thing out of futurity. He came straight up to me and laughed into my&#10;eyes. The absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at&#10;once. Then he turned to the two others who were following him and&#10;spoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue.&#10;&#10;'There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps&#10;eight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me. One of them&#10;addressed me. It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice was&#10;too harsh and deep for them. So I shook my head, and, pointing to my&#10;ears, shook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and then&#10;touched my hand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my&#10;back and shoulders. They wanted to make sure I was real. There was&#10;nothing in this at all alarming. Indeed, there was something in&#10;these pretty little people that inspired confidence--a graceful&#10;gentleness, a certain childlike ease. And besides, they looked so&#10;frail that I could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them&#10;about like nine-pins. But I made a sudden motion to warn them when I&#10;saw their little pink hands feeling at the Time Machine. Happily&#10;then, when it was not too late, I thought of a danger I had hitherto&#10;forgotten, and reaching over the bars of the machine I unscrewed the&#10;little levers that would set it in motion, and put these in my&#10;pocket. Then I turned again to see what I could do in the way of&#10;communication.&#10;&#10;'And then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw some&#10;further peculiarities in their Dresden-china type of prettiness.&#10;Their hair, which was uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at the&#10;neck and cheek; there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the&#10;face, and their ears were singularly minute. The mouths were small,&#10;with bright red, rather thin lips, and the little chins ran to a&#10;point. The eyes were large and mild; and--this may seem egotism on&#10;my part--I fancied even that there was a certain lack of the&#10;interest I might have expected in them.&#10;&#10;'As they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood&#10;round me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I&#10;began the conversation. I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself.&#10;Then hesitating for a moment how to express time, I pointed to the&#10;sun. At once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and&#10;white followed my gesture, and then astonished me by imitating the&#10;sound of thunder.&#10;&#10;'For a moment I was staggered, though the import of his gesture was&#10;plain enough. The question had come into my mind abruptly: were&#10;these creatures fools? You may hardly understand how it took me.&#10;You see I had always anticipated that the people of the year Eight&#10;Hundred and Two Thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in&#10;knowledge, art, everything. Then one of them suddenly asked me a&#10;question that showed him to be on the intellectual level of one of&#10;our five-year-old children--asked me, in fact, if I had come from&#10;the sun in a thunderstorm! It let loose the judgment I had suspended&#10;upon their clothes, their frail light limbs, and fragile features.&#10;A flow of disappointment rushed across my mind. For a moment I felt&#10;that I had built the Time Machine in vain.&#10;&#10;'I nodded, pointed to the sun, and gave them such a vivid rendering&#10;of a thunderclap as startled them. They all withdrew a pace or so&#10;and bowed. Then came one laughing towards me, carrying a chain of&#10;beautiful flowers altogether new to me, and put it about my neck.&#10;The idea was received with melodious applause; and presently they&#10;were all running to and fro for flowers, and laughingly flinging&#10;them upon me until I was almost smothered with blossom. You who&#10;have never seen the like can scarcely imagine what delicate and&#10;wonderful flowers countless years of culture had created. Then&#10;someone suggested that their plaything should be exhibited in the&#10;nearest building, and so I was led past the sphinx of white marble,&#10;which had seemed to watch me all the while with a smile at my&#10;astonishment, towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone. As I&#10;went with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a&#10;profoundly grave and intellectual posterity came, with irresistible&#10;merriment, to my mind.&#10;&#10;'The building had a huge entry, and was altogether of colossal&#10;dimensions. I was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of&#10;little people, and with the big open portals that yawned before me&#10;shadowy and mysterious. My general impression of the world I saw&#10;over their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and&#10;flowers, a long neglected and yet weedless garden. I saw a number&#10;of tall spikes of strange white flowers, measuring a foot perhaps&#10;across the spread of the waxen petals. They grew scattered, as if&#10;wild, among the variegated shrubs, but, as I say, I did not examine&#10;them closely at this time. The Time Machine was left deserted on the&#10;turf among the rhododendrons.&#10;&#10;'The arch of the doorway was richly carved, but naturally I did&#10;not observe the carving very narrowly, though I fancied I saw&#10;suggestions of old Phoenician decorations as I passed through, and&#10;it struck me that they were very badly broken and weather-worn.&#10;Several more brightly clad people met me in the doorway, and so we&#10;entered, I, dressed in dingy nineteenth-century garments, looking&#10;grotesque enough, garlanded with flowers, and surrounded by an&#10;eddying mass of bright, soft-colored robes and shining white limbs,&#10;in a melodious whirl of laughter and laughing speech.&#10;&#10;'The big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with&#10;brown. The roof was in shadow, and the windows, partially glazed&#10;with coloured glass and partially unglazed, admitted a tempered&#10;light. The floor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white&#10;metal, not plates nor slabs--blocks, and it was so much worn, as I&#10;judged by the going to and fro of past generations, as to be deeply&#10;channelled along the more frequented ways. Transverse to the length&#10;were innumerable tables made of slabs of polished stone, raised&#10;perhaps a foot from the floor, and upon these were heaps of fruits.&#10;Some I recognized as a kind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange,&#10;but for the most part they were strange.&#10;&#10;'Between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions.&#10;Upon these my conductors seated themselves, signing for me to do&#10;likewise. With a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the&#10;fruit with their hands, flinging peel and stalks, and so forth, into&#10;the round openings in the sides of the tables. I was not loath to&#10;follow their example, for I felt thirsty and hungry. As I did so I&#10;surveyed the hall at my leisure.&#10;&#10;'And perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look.&#10;The stained-glass windows, which displayed only a geometrical&#10;pattern, were broken in many places, and the curtains that hung&#10;across the lower end were thick with dust. And it caught my eye that&#10;the corner of the marble table near me was fractured. Nevertheless,&#10;the general effect was extremely rich and picturesque. There were,&#10;perhaps, a couple of hundred people dining in the hall, and most of&#10;them, seated as near to me as they could come, were watching me with&#10;interest, their little eyes shining over the fruit they were eating.&#10;All were clad in the same soft and yet strong, silky material.&#10;&#10;'Fruit, by the by, was all their diet. These people of the remote&#10;future were strict vegetarians, and while I was with them, in spite&#10;of some carnal cravings, I had to be frugivorous also. Indeed, I&#10;found afterwards that horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, had followed the&#10;Ichthyosaurus into extinction. But the fruits were very delightful;&#10;one, in particular, that seemed to be in season all the time I was&#10;there--a floury thing in a three-sided husk--was especially good,&#10;and I made it my staple. At first I was puzzled by all these strange&#10;fruits, and by the strange flowers I saw, but later I began to&#10;perceive their import.&#10;&#10;'However, I am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future&#10;now. So soon as my appetite was a little checked, I determined to&#10;make a resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of&#10;mine. Clearly that was the next thing to do. The fruits seemed a&#10;convenient thing to begin upon, and holding one of these up I began&#10;a series of interrogative sounds and gestures. I had some&#10;considerable difficulty in conveying my meaning. At first my efforts&#10;met with a stare of surprise or inextinguishable laughter, but&#10;presently a fair-haired little creature seemed to grasp my intention&#10;and repeated a name. They had to chatter and explain the business&#10;at great length to each other, and my first attempts to make the&#10;exquisite little sounds of their language caused an immense amount&#10;of amusement. However, I felt like a schoolmaster amidst children,&#10;and persisted, and presently I had a score of noun substantives at&#10;least at my command; and then I got to demonstrative pronouns, and&#10;even the verb &quot;to eat.&quot; But it was slow work, and the little people&#10;soon tired and wanted to get away from my interrogations, so I&#10;determined, rather of necessity, to let them give their lessons in&#10;little doses when they felt inclined. And very little doses I found&#10;they were before long, for I never met people more indolent or more&#10;easily fatigued.&#10;&#10;'A queer thing I soon discovered about my little hosts, and that was&#10;their lack of interest. They would come to me with eager cries of&#10;astonishment, like children, but like children they would soon stop&#10;examining me and wander away after some other toy. The dinner and my&#10;conversational beginnings ended, I noted for the first time that&#10;almost all those who had surrounded me at first were gone. It is&#10;odd, too, how speedily I came to disregard these little people. I&#10;went out through the portal into the sunlit world again as soon as&#10;my hunger was satisfied. I was continually meeting more of these men&#10;of the future, who would follow me a little distance, chatter and&#10;laugh about me, and, having smiled and gesticulated in a friendly&#10;way, leave me again to my own devices.&#10;&#10;'The calm of evening was upon the world as I emerged from the great&#10;hall, and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun.&#10;At first things were very confusing. Everything was so entirely&#10;different from the world I had known--even the flowers. The big&#10;building I had left was situated on the slope of a broad river&#10;valley, but the Thames had shifted perhaps a mile from its present&#10;position. I resolved to mount to the summit of a crest, perhaps a&#10;mile and a half away, from which I could get a wider view of this&#10;our planet in the year Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred&#10;and One A.D. For that, I should explain, was the date the little&#10;dials of my machine recorded.&#10;&#10;'As I walked I was watching for every impression that could possibly&#10;help to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which I&#10;found the world--for ruinous it was. A little way up the hill, for&#10;instance, was a great heap of granite, bound together by masses of&#10;aluminium, a vast labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled&#10;heaps, amidst which were thick heaps of very beautiful pagoda-like&#10;plants--nettles possibly--but wonderfully tinted with brown about&#10;the leaves, and incapable of stinging. It was evidently the derelict&#10;remains of some vast structure, to what end built I could not&#10;determine. It was here that I was destined, at a later date, to have&#10;a very strange experience--the first intimation of a still stranger&#10;discovery--but of that I will speak in its proper place.&#10;&#10;'Looking round with a sudden thought, from a terrace on which I&#10;rested for a while, I realized that there were no small houses to be&#10;seen. Apparently the single house, and possibly even the household,&#10;had vanished. Here and there among the greenery were palace-like&#10;buildings, but the house and the cottage, which form such&#10;characteristic features of our own English landscape, had&#10;disappeared.&#10;&#10;'&quot;Communism,&quot; said I to myself.&#10;&#10;'And on the heels of that came another thought. I looked at the&#10;half-dozen little figures that were following me. Then, in a flash,&#10;I perceived that all had the same form of costume, the same soft&#10;hairless visage, and the same girlish rotundity of limb. It may seem&#10;strange, perhaps, that I had not noticed this before. But everything&#10;was so strange. Now, I saw the fact plainly enough. In costume, and&#10;in all the differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the&#10;sexes from each other, these people of the future were alike. And&#10;the children seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their&#10;parents. I judged, then, that the children of that time were&#10;extremely precocious, physically at least, and I found afterwards&#10;abundant verification of my opinion.&#10;&#10;'Seeing the ease and security in which these people were living, I&#10;felt that this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what&#10;one would expect; for the strength of a man and the softness of a&#10;woman, the institution of the family, and the differentiation of&#10;occupations are mere militant necessities of an age of physical&#10;force; where population is balanced and abundant, much childbearing&#10;becomes an evil rather than a blessing to the State; where&#10;violence comes but rarely and off-spring are secure, there is less&#10;necessity--indeed there is no necessity--for an efficient family,&#10;and the specialization of the sexes with reference to their&#10;children's needs disappears. We see some beginnings of this even&#10;in our own time, and in this future age it was complete. This, I&#10;must remind you, was my speculation at the time. Later, I was to&#10;appreciate how far it fell short of the reality.&#10;&#10;'While I was musing upon these things, my attention was attracted by&#10;a pretty little structure, like a well under a cupola. I thought in&#10;a transitory way of the oddness of wells still existing, and then&#10;resumed the thread of my speculations. There were no large buildings&#10;towards the top of the hill, and as my walking powers were evidently&#10;miraculous, I was presently left alone for the first time. With a&#10;strange sense of freedom and adventure I pushed on up to the crest.&#10;&#10;'There I found a seat of some yellow metal that I did not recognize,&#10;corroded in places with a kind of pinkish rust and half smothered&#10;in soft moss, the arm-rests cast and filed into the resemblance of&#10;griffins' heads. I sat down on it, and I surveyed the broad view of&#10;our old world under the sunset of that long day. It was as sweet and&#10;fair a view as I have ever seen. The sun had already gone below the&#10;horizon and the west was flaming gold, touched with some horizontal&#10;bars of purple and crimson. Below was the valley of the Thames, in&#10;which the river lay like a band of burnished steel. I have already&#10;spoken of the great palaces dotted about among the variegated&#10;greenery, some in ruins and some still occupied. Here and there rose&#10;a white or silvery figure in the waste garden of the earth, here and&#10;there came the sharp vertical line of some cupola or obelisk. There&#10;were no hedges, no signs of proprietary rights, no evidences of&#10;agriculture; the whole earth had become a garden.&#10;&#10;'So watching, I began to put my interpretation upon the things I had&#10;seen, and as it shaped itself to me that evening, my interpretation&#10;was something in this way. (Afterwards I found I had got only a&#10;half-truth--or only a glimpse of one facet of the truth.)&#10;&#10;'It seemed to me that I had happened upon humanity upon the wane.&#10;The ruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind. For the&#10;first time I began to realize an odd consequence of the social&#10;effort in which we are at present engaged. And yet, come to think,&#10;it is a logical consequence enough. Strength is the outcome of need;&#10;security sets a premium on feebleness. The work of ameliorating the&#10;conditions of life--the true civilizing process that makes life more&#10;and more secure--had gone steadily on to a climax. One triumph of a&#10;united humanity over Nature had followed another. Things that are&#10;now mere dreams had become projects deliberately put in hand and&#10;carried forward. And the harvest was what I saw!&#10;&#10;'After all, the sanitation and the agriculture of to-day are still&#10;in the rudimentary stage. The science of our time has attacked but&#10;a little department of the field of human disease, but even so,&#10;it spreads its operations very steadily and persistently. Our&#10;agriculture and horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and&#10;cultivate perhaps a score or so of wholesome plants, leaving the&#10;greater number to fight out a balance as they can. We improve our&#10;favourite plants and animals--and how few they are--gradually by&#10;selective breeding; now a new and better peach, now a seedless&#10;grape, now a sweeter and larger flower, now a more convenient breed&#10;of cattle. We improve them gradually, because our ideals are vague&#10;and tentative, and our knowledge is very limited; because Nature,&#10;too, is shy and slow in our clumsy hands. Some day all this will&#10;be better organized, and still better. That is the drift of the&#10;current in spite of the eddies. The whole world will be intelligent,&#10;educated, and co-operating; things will move faster and faster&#10;towards the subjugation of Nature. In the end, wisely and carefully&#10;we shall readjust the balance of animal and vegetable life to suit&#10;our human needs.&#10;&#10;'This adjustment, I say, must have been done, and done well; done&#10;indeed for all Time, in the space of Time across which my machine&#10;had leaped. The air was free from gnats, the earth from weeds or&#10;fungi; everywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers;&#10;brilliant butterflies flew hither and thither. The ideal of&#10;preventive medicine was attained. Diseases had been stamped out. I&#10;saw no evidence of any contagious diseases during all my stay. And I&#10;shall have to tell you later that even the processes of putrefaction&#10;and decay had been profoundly affected by these changes.&#10;&#10;'Social triumphs, too, had been effected. I saw mankind housed in&#10;splendid shelters, gloriously clothed, and as yet I had found them&#10;engaged in no toil. There were no signs of struggle, neither social&#10;nor economical struggle. The shop, the advertisement, traffic, all&#10;that commerce which constitutes the body of our world, was gone. It&#10;was natural on that golden evening that I should jump at the idea of&#10;a social paradise. The difficulty of increasing population had been&#10;met, I guessed, and population had ceased to increase.&#10;&#10;'But with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to&#10;the change. What, unless biological science is a mass of errors, is&#10;the cause of human intelligence and vigour? Hardship and freedom:&#10;conditions under which the active, strong, and subtle survive and&#10;the weaker go to the wall; conditions that put a premium upon the&#10;loyal alliance of capable men, upon self-restraint, patience, and&#10;decision. And the institution of the family, and the emotions that&#10;arise therein, the fierce jealousy, the tenderness for offspring,&#10;parental self-devotion, all found their justification and support in&#10;the imminent dangers of the young. _Now_, where are these imminent&#10;dangers? There is a sentiment arising, and it will grow, against&#10;connubial jealousy, against fierce maternity, against passion&#10;of all sorts; unnecessary things now, and things that make us&#10;uncomfortable, savage survivals, discords in a refined and pleasant&#10;life.&#10;&#10;'I thought of the physical slightness of the people, their lack of&#10;intelligence, and those big abundant ruins, and it strengthened my&#10;belief in a perfect conquest of Nature. For after the battle comes&#10;Quiet. Humanity had been strong, energetic, and intelligent, and had&#10;used all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under which&#10;it lived. And now came the reaction of the altered conditions.&#10;&#10;'Under the new conditions of perfect comfort and security, that&#10;restless energy, that with us is strength, would become weakness.&#10;Even in our own time certain tendencies and desires, once necessary&#10;to survival, are a constant source of failure. Physical courage and&#10;the love of battle, for instance, are no great help--may even be&#10;hindrances--to a civilized man. And in a state of physical balance&#10;and security, power, intellectual as well as physical, would be out&#10;of place. For countless years I judged there had been no danger of&#10;war or solitary violence, no danger from wild beasts, no wasting&#10;disease to require strength of constitution, no need of toil. For&#10;such a life, what we should call the weak are as well equipped as&#10;the strong, are indeed no longer weak. Better equipped indeed they&#10;are, for the strong would be fretted by an energy for which there&#10;was no outlet. No doubt the exquisite beauty of the buildings I saw&#10;was the outcome of the last surgings of the now purposeless energy&#10;of mankind before it settled down into perfect harmony with the&#10;conditions under which it lived--the flourish of that triumph which&#10;began the last great peace. This has ever been the fate of energy in&#10;security; it takes to art and to eroticism, and then come languor&#10;and decay.&#10;&#10;'Even this artistic impetus would at last die away--had almost died&#10;in the Time I saw. To adorn themselves with flowers, to dance, to&#10;sing in the sunlight: so much was left of the artistic spirit, and&#10;no more. Even that would fade in the end into a contented&#10;inactivity. We are kept keen on the grindstone of pain and&#10;necessity, and, it seemed to me, that here was that hateful&#10;grindstone broken at last!&#10;&#10;'As I stood there in the gathering dark I thought that in this&#10;simple explanation I had mastered the problem of the world--mastered&#10;the whole secret of these delicious people. Possibly the checks they&#10;had devised for the increase of population had succeeded too well,&#10;and their numbers had rather diminished than kept stationary.&#10;That would account for the abandoned ruins. Very simple was my&#10;explanation, and plausible enough--as most wrong theories are!&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;V&#10;&#10;&#10;'As I stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man, the&#10;full moon, yellow and gibbous, came up out of an overflow of silver&#10;light in the north-east. The bright little figures ceased to move&#10;about below, a noiseless owl flitted by, and I shivered with the&#10;chill of the night. I determined to descend and find where I could&#10;sleep.&#10;&#10;'I looked for the building I knew. Then my eye travelled along to&#10;the figure of the White Sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze, growing&#10;distinct as the light of the rising moon grew brighter. I could see&#10;the silver birch against it. There was the tangle of rhododendron&#10;bushes, black in the pale light, and there was the little lawn.&#10;I looked at the lawn again. A queer doubt chilled my complacency.&#10;&quot;No,&quot; said I stoutly to myself, &quot;that was not the lawn.&quot;&#10;&#10;'But it _was_ the lawn. For the white leprous face of the sphinx was&#10;towards it. Can you imagine what I felt as this conviction came&#10;home to me? But you cannot. The Time Machine was gone!&#10;&#10;'At once, like a lash across the face, came the possibility of&#10;losing my own age, of being left helpless in this strange new world.&#10;The bare thought of it was an actual physical sensation. I could&#10;feel it grip me at the throat and stop my breathing. In another&#10;moment I was in a passion of fear and running with great leaping&#10;strides down the slope. Once I fell headlong and cut my face; I lost&#10;no time in stanching the blood, but jumped up and ran on, with a&#10;warm trickle down my cheek and chin. All the time I ran I was saying&#10;to myself: &quot;They have moved it a little, pushed it under the bushes&#10;out of the way.&quot; Nevertheless, I ran with all my might. All the&#10;time, with the certainty that sometimes comes with excessive dread,&#10;I knew that such assurance was folly, knew instinctively that the&#10;machine was removed out of my reach. My breath came with pain. I&#10;suppose I covered the whole distance from the hill crest to the&#10;little lawn, two miles perhaps, in ten minutes. And I am not a young&#10;man. I cursed aloud, as I ran, at my confident folly in leaving the&#10;machine, wasting good breath thereby. I cried aloud, and none&#10;answered. Not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlit&#10;world.&#10;&#10;'When I reached the lawn my worst fears were realized. Not a trace&#10;of the thing was to be seen. I felt faint and cold when I faced the&#10;empty space among the black tangle of bushes. I ran round it&#10;furiously, as if the thing might be hidden in a corner, and then&#10;stopped abruptly, with my hands clutching my hair. Above me towered&#10;the sphinx, upon the bronze pedestal, white, shining, leprous, in&#10;the light of the rising moon. It seemed to smile in mockery of my&#10;dismay.&#10;&#10;'I might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had put&#10;the mechanism in some shelter for me, had I not felt assured of&#10;their physical and intellectual inadequacy. That is what dismayed&#10;me: the sense of some hitherto unsuspected power, through whose&#10;intervention my invention had vanished. Yet, for one thing I felt&#10;assured: unless some other age had produced its exact duplicate,&#10;the machine could not have moved in time. The attachment of the&#10;levers--I will show you the method later--prevented any one from&#10;tampering with it in that way when they were removed. It had moved,&#10;and was hid, only in space. But then, where could it be?&#10;&#10;'I think I must have had a kind of frenzy. I remember running&#10;violently in and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx,&#10;and startling some white animal that, in the dim light, I took for a&#10;small deer. I remember, too, late that night, beating the bushes&#10;with my clenched fist until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding&#10;from the broken twigs. Then, sobbing and raving in my anguish of&#10;mind, I went down to the great building of stone. The big hall was&#10;dark, silent, and deserted. I slipped on the uneven floor, and fell&#10;over one of the malachite tables, almost breaking my shin. I lit a&#10;match and went on past the dusty curtains, of which I have told you.&#10;&#10;'There I found a second great hall covered with cushions, upon&#10;which, perhaps, a score or so of the little people were sleeping. I&#10;have no doubt they found my second appearance strange enough, coming&#10;suddenly out of the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises and the&#10;splutter and flare of a match. For they had forgotten about matches.&#10;&quot;Where is my Time Machine?&quot; I began, bawling like an angry child,&#10;laying hands upon them and shaking them up together. It must have&#10;been very queer to them. Some laughed, most of them looked sorely&#10;frightened. When I saw them standing round me, it came into my head&#10;that I was doing as foolish a thing as it was possible for me to do&#10;under the circumstances, in trying to revive the sensation of fear.&#10;For, reasoning from their daylight behaviour, I thought that fear&#10;must be forgotten.&#10;&#10;'Abruptly, I dashed down the match, and, knocking one of the people&#10;over in my course, went blundering across the big dining-hall again,&#10;out under the moonlight. I heard cries of terror and their little&#10;feet running and stumbling this way and that. I do not remember all&#10;I did as the moon crept up the sky. I suppose it was the unexpected&#10;nature of my loss that maddened me. I felt hopelessly cut off from&#10;my own kind--a strange animal in an unknown world. I must have raved&#10;to and fro, screaming and crying upon God and Fate. I have a memory&#10;of horrible fatigue, as the long night of despair wore away; of&#10;looking in this impossible place and that; of groping among moon-lit&#10;ruins and touching strange creatures in the black shadows; at last,&#10;of lying on the ground near the sphinx and weeping with absolute&#10;wretchedness. I had nothing left but misery. Then I slept, and when&#10;I woke again it was full day, and a couple of sparrows were hopping&#10;round me on the turf within reach of my arm.&#10;&#10;'I sat up in the freshness of the morning, trying to remember how&#10;I had got there, and why I had such a profound sense of desertion&#10;and despair. Then things came clear in my mind. With the plain,&#10;reasonable daylight, I could look my circumstances fairly in the&#10;face. I saw the wild folly of my frenzy overnight, and I could&#10;reason with myself. &quot;Suppose the worst?&quot; I said. &quot;Suppose the&#10;machine altogether lost--perhaps destroyed? It behoves me to be&#10;calm and patient, to learn the way of the people, to get a clear&#10;idea of the method of my loss, and the means of getting materials&#10;and tools; so that in the end, perhaps, I may make another.&quot; That&#10;would be my only hope, perhaps, but better than despair. And, after&#10;all, it was a beautiful and curious world.&#10;&#10;'But probably, the machine had only been taken away. Still, I must&#10;be calm and patient, find its hiding-place, and recover it by force&#10;or cunning. And with that I scrambled to my feet and looked about&#10;me, wondering where I could bathe. I felt weary, stiff, and&#10;travel-soiled. The freshness of the morning made me desire an equal&#10;freshness. I had exhausted my emotion. Indeed, as I went about&#10;my business, I found myself wondering at my intense excitement&#10;overnight. I made a careful examination of the ground about the&#10;little lawn. I wasted some time in futile questionings, conveyed, as&#10;well as I was able, to such of the little people as came by. They&#10;all failed to understand my gestures; some were simply stolid, some&#10;thought it was a jest and laughed at me. I had the hardest task in&#10;the world to keep my hands off their pretty laughing faces. It was&#10;a foolish impulse, but the devil begotten of fear and blind anger&#10;was ill curbed and still eager to take advantage of my perplexity.&#10;The turf gave better counsel. I found a groove ripped in it, about&#10;midway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of my feet&#10;where, on arrival, I had struggled with the overturned machine.&#10;There were other signs of removal about, with queer narrow&#10;footprints like those I could imagine made by a sloth. This directed&#10;my closer attention to the pedestal. It was, as I think I have said,&#10;of bronze. It was not a mere block, but highly decorated with deep&#10;framed panels on either side. I went and rapped at these. The&#10;pedestal was hollow. Examining the panels with care I found them&#10;discontinuous with the frames. There were no handles or keyholes,&#10;but possibly the panels, if they were doors, as I supposed, opened&#10;from within. One thing was clear enough to my mind. It took no very&#10;great mental effort to infer that my Time Machine was inside that&#10;pedestal. But how it got there was a different problem.&#10;&#10;'I saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the bushes&#10;and under some blossom-covered apple-trees towards me. I turned&#10;smiling to them and beckoned them to me. They came, and then,&#10;pointing to the bronze pedestal, I tried to intimate my wish to open&#10;it. But at my first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly. I&#10;don't know how to convey their expression to you. Suppose you were&#10;to use a grossly improper gesture to a delicate-minded woman--it is&#10;how she would look. They went off as if they had received the last&#10;possible insult. I tried a sweet-looking little chap in white next,&#10;with exactly the same result. Somehow, his manner made me feel&#10;ashamed of myself. But, as you know, I wanted the Time Machine, and&#10;I tried him once more. As he turned off, like the others, my temper&#10;got the better of me. In three strides I was after him, had him by&#10;the loose part of his robe round the neck, and began dragging him&#10;towards the sphinx. Then I saw the horror and repugnance of his&#10;face, and all of a sudden I let him go.&#10;&#10;'But I was not beaten yet. I banged with my fist at the bronze&#10;panels. I thought I heard something stir inside--to be explicit,&#10;I thought I heard a sound like a chuckle--but I must have been&#10;mistaken. Then I got a big pebble from the river, and came and&#10;hammered till I had flattened a coil in the decorations, and the&#10;verdigris came off in powdery flakes. The delicate little people&#10;must have heard me hammering in gusty outbreaks a mile away on&#10;either hand, but nothing came of it. I saw a crowd of them upon the&#10;slopes, looking furtively at me. At last, hot and tired, I sat down&#10;to watch the place. But I was too restless to watch long; I am too&#10;Occidental for a long vigil. I could work at a problem for years,&#10;but to wait inactive for twenty-four hours--that is another matter.&#10;&#10;'I got up after a time, and began walking aimlessly through the&#10;bushes towards the hill again. &quot;Patience,&quot; said I to myself. &quot;If you&#10;want your machine again you must leave that sphinx alone. If they&#10;mean to take your machine away, it's little good your wrecking their&#10;bronze panels, and if they don't, you will get it back as soon as&#10;you can ask for it. To sit among all those unknown things before a&#10;puzzle like that is hopeless. That way lies monomania. Face this&#10;world. Learn its ways, watch it, be careful of too hasty guesses&#10;at its meaning. In the end you will find clues to it all.&quot; Then&#10;suddenly the humour of the situation came into my mind: the thought&#10;of the years I had spent in study and toil to get into the future&#10;age, and now my passion of anxiety to get out of it. I had made&#10;myself the most complicated and the most hopeless trap that ever a&#10;man devised. Although it was at my own expense, I could not help&#10;myself. I laughed aloud.&#10;&#10;'Going through the big palace, it seemed to me that the little&#10;people avoided me. It may have been my fancy, or it may have had&#10;something to do with my hammering at the gates of bronze. Yet I felt&#10;tolerably sure of the avoidance. I was careful, however, to show no&#10;concern and to abstain from any pursuit of them, and in the course&#10;of a day or two things got back to the old footing. I made what&#10;progress I could in the language, and in addition I pushed my&#10;explorations here and there. Either I missed some subtle point or&#10;their language was excessively simple--almost exclusively composed&#10;of concrete substantives and verbs. There seemed to be few, if any,&#10;abstract terms, or little use of figurative language. Their&#10;sentences were usually simple and of two words, and I failed to&#10;convey or understand any but the simplest propositions. I determined&#10;to put the thought of my Time Machine and the mystery of the bronze&#10;doors under the sphinx as much as possible in a corner of memory,&#10;until my growing knowledge would lead me back to them in a natural&#10;way. Yet a certain feeling, you may understand, tethered me in a&#10;circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival.&#10;&#10;'So far as I could see, all the world displayed the same exuberant&#10;richness as the Thames valley. From every hill I climbed I saw the&#10;same abundance of splendid buildings, endlessly varied in material&#10;and style, the same clustering thickets of evergreens, the same&#10;blossom-laden trees and tree-ferns. Here and there water shone like&#10;silver, and beyond, the land rose into blue undulating hills, and&#10;so faded into the serenity of the sky. A peculiar feature, which&#10;presently attracted my attention, was the presence of certain&#10;circular wells, several, as it seemed to me, of a very great depth.&#10;One lay by the path up the hill, which I had followed during my&#10;first walk. Like the others, it was rimmed with bronze, curiously&#10;wrought, and protected by a little cupola from the rain. Sitting by&#10;the side of these wells, and peering down into the shafted darkness,&#10;I could see no gleam of water, nor could I start any reflection&#10;with a lighted match. But in all of them I heard a certain sound:&#10;a thud--thud--thud, like the beating of some big engine; and I&#10;discovered, from the flaring of my matches, that a steady current of&#10;air set down the shafts. Further, I threw a scrap of paper into the&#10;throat of one, and, instead of fluttering slowly down, it was at&#10;once sucked swiftly out of sight.&#10;&#10;'After a time, too, I came to connect these wells with tall towers&#10;standing here and there upon the slopes; for above them there was&#10;often just such a flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day above&#10;a sun-scorched beach. Putting things together, I reached a strong&#10;suggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation, whose&#10;true import it was difficult to imagine. I was at first inclined to&#10;associate it with the sanitary apparatus of these people. It was an&#10;obvious conclusion, but it was absolutely wrong.&#10;&#10;'And here I must admit that I learned very little of drains and&#10;bells and modes of conveyance, and the like conveniences, during my&#10;time in this real future. In some of these visions of Utopias and&#10;coming times which I have read, there is a vast amount of detail&#10;about building, and social arrangements, and so forth. But while&#10;such details are easy enough to obtain when the whole world is&#10;contained in one's imagination, they are altogether inaccessible to&#10;a real traveller amid such realities as I found here. Conceive the&#10;tale of London which a negro, fresh from Central Africa, would take&#10;back to his tribe! What would he know of railway companies, of&#10;social movements, of telephone and telegraph wires, of the Parcels&#10;Delivery Company, and postal orders and the like? Yet we, at least,&#10;should be willing enough to explain these things to him! And even of&#10;what he knew, how much could he make his untravelled friend either&#10;apprehend or believe? Then, think how narrow the gap between a negro&#10;and a white man of our own times, and how wide the interval between&#10;myself and these of the Golden Age! I was sensible of much which was&#10;unseen, and which contributed to my comfort; but save for a general&#10;impression of automatic organization, I fear I can convey very&#10;little of the difference to your mind.&#10;&#10;'In the matter of sepulture, for instance, I could see no signs of&#10;crematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs. But it occurred to me&#10;that, possibly, there might be cemeteries (or crematoria) somewhere&#10;beyond the range of my explorings. This, again, was a question I&#10;deliberately put to myself, and my curiosity was at first entirely&#10;defeated upon the point. The thing puzzled me, and I was led to make&#10;a further remark, which puzzled me still more: that aged and infirm&#10;among this people there were none.&#10;&#10;'I must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an&#10;automatic civilization and a decadent humanity did not long endure.&#10;Yet I could think of no other. Let me put my difficulties. The&#10;several big palaces I had explored were mere living places, great&#10;dining-halls and sleeping apartments. I could find no machinery, no&#10;appliances of any kind. Yet these people were clothed in pleasant&#10;fabrics that must at times need renewal, and their sandals, though&#10;undecorated, were fairly complex specimens of metalwork. Somehow&#10;such things must be made. And the little people displayed no vestige&#10;of a creative tendency. There were no shops, no workshops, no sign&#10;of importations among them. They spent all their time in playing&#10;gently, in bathing in the river, in making love in a half-playful&#10;fashion, in eating fruit and sleeping. I could not see how things&#10;were kept going.&#10;&#10;'Then, again, about the Time Machine: something, I knew not what,&#10;had taken it into the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx. Why? For&#10;the life of me I could not imagine. Those waterless wells, too,&#10;those flickering pillars. I felt I lacked a clue. I felt--how shall&#10;I put it? Suppose you found an inscription, with sentences here and&#10;there in excellent plain English, and interpolated therewith, others&#10;made up of words, of letters even, absolutely unknown to you? Well,&#10;on the third day of my visit, that was how the world of Eight&#10;Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One presented itself to&#10;me!&#10;&#10;'That day, too, I made a friend--of a sort. It happened that, as I&#10;was watching some of the little people bathing in a shallow, one of&#10;them was seized with cramp and began drifting downstream. The main&#10;current ran rather swiftly, but not too strongly for even a moderate&#10;swimmer. It will give you an idea, therefore, of the strange&#10;deficiency in these creatures, when I tell you that none made the&#10;slightest attempt to rescue the weakly crying little thing which&#10;was drowning before their eyes. When I realized this, I hurriedly&#10;slipped off my clothes, and, wading in at a point lower down, I&#10;caught the poor mite and drew her safe to land. A little rubbing of&#10;the limbs soon brought her round, and I had the satisfaction of&#10;seeing she was all right before I left her. I had got to such a low&#10;estimate of her kind that I did not expect any gratitude from her.&#10;In that, however, I was wrong.&#10;&#10;'This happened in the morning. In the afternoon I met my little&#10;woman, as I believe it was, as I was returning towards my centre&#10;from an exploration, and she received me with cries of delight and&#10;presented me with a big garland of flowers--evidently made for me&#10;and me alone. The thing took my imagination. Very possibly I had&#10;been feeling desolate. At any rate I did my best to display my&#10;appreciation of the gift. We were soon seated together in a little&#10;stone arbour, engaged in conversation, chiefly of smiles. The&#10;creature's friendliness affected me exactly as a child's might have&#10;done. We passed each other flowers, and she kissed my hands. I did&#10;the same to hers. Then I tried talk, and found that her name was&#10;Weena, which, though I don't know what it meant, somehow seemed&#10;appropriate enough. That was the beginning of a queer friendship&#10;which lasted a week, and ended--as I will tell you!&#10;&#10;'She was exactly like a child. She wanted to be with me always. She&#10;tried to follow me everywhere, and on my next journey out and about&#10;it went to my heart to tire her down, and leave her at last,&#10;exhausted and calling after me rather plaintively. But the problems&#10;of the world had to be mastered. I had not, I said to myself, come&#10;into the future to carry on a miniature flirtation. Yet her distress&#10;when I left her was very great, her expostulations at the parting&#10;were sometimes frantic, and I think, altogether, I had as much&#10;trouble as comfort from her devotion. Nevertheless she was, somehow,&#10;a very great comfort. I thought it was mere childish affection that&#10;made her cling to me. Until it was too late, I did not clearly know&#10;what I had inflicted upon her when I left her. Nor until it was too&#10;late did I clearly understand what she was to me. For, by merely&#10;seeming fond of me, and showing in her weak, futile way that she&#10;cared for me, the little doll of a creature presently gave my return&#10;to the neighbourhood of the White Sphinx almost the feeling of&#10;coming home; and I would watch for her tiny figure of white and gold&#10;so soon as I came over the hill.&#10;&#10;'It was from her, too, that I learned that fear had not yet left the&#10;world. She was fearless enough in the daylight, and she had the&#10;oddest confidence in me; for once, in a foolish moment, I made&#10;threatening grimaces at her, and she simply laughed at them. But she&#10;dreaded the dark, dreaded shadows, dreaded black things. Darkness&#10;to her was the one thing dreadful. It was a singularly passionate&#10;emotion, and it set me thinking and observing. I discovered then,&#10;among other things, that these little people gathered into the great&#10;houses after dark, and slept in droves. To enter upon them without a&#10;light was to put them into a tumult of apprehension. I never found&#10;one out of doors, or one sleeping alone within doors, after dark.&#10;Yet I was still such a blockhead that I missed the lesson of that&#10;fear, and in spite of Weena's distress I insisted upon sleeping away&#10;from these slumbering multitudes.&#10;&#10;'It troubled her greatly, but in the end her odd affection for me&#10;triumphed, and for five of the nights of our acquaintance, including&#10;the last night of all, she slept with her head pillowed on my arm.&#10;But my story slips away from me as I speak of her. It must have been&#10;the night before her rescue that I was awakened about dawn. I had&#10;been restless, dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned, and&#10;that sea anemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps.&#10;I woke with a start, and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal&#10;had just rushed out of the chamber. I tried to get to sleep again,&#10;but I felt restless and uncomfortable. It was that dim grey hour&#10;when things are just creeping out of darkness, when everything is&#10;colourless and clear cut, and yet unreal. I got up, and went down&#10;into the great hall, and so out upon the flagstones in front of the&#10;palace. I thought I would make a virtue of necessity, and see the&#10;sunrise.&#10;&#10;'The moon was setting, and the dying moonlight and the first pallor&#10;of dawn were mingled in a ghastly half-light. The bushes were inky&#10;black, the ground a sombre grey, the sky colourless and cheerless.&#10;And up the hill I thought I could see ghosts. There several times,&#10;as I scanned the slope, I saw white figures. Twice I fancied I saw&#10;a solitary white, ape-like creature running rather quickly up the&#10;hill, and once near the ruins I saw a leash of them carrying some&#10;dark body. They moved hastily. I did not see what became of them.&#10;It seemed that they vanished among the bushes. The dawn was still&#10;indistinct, you must understand. I was feeling that chill,&#10;uncertain, early-morning feeling you may have known. I doubted&#10;my eyes.&#10;&#10;'As the eastern sky grew brighter, and the light of the day came on&#10;and its vivid colouring returned upon the world once more, I scanned&#10;the view keenly. But I saw no vestige of my white figures. They were&#10;mere creatures of the half light. &quot;They must have been ghosts,&quot; I&#10;said; &quot;I wonder whence they dated.&quot; For a queer notion of Grant&#10;Allen's came into my head, and amused me. If each generation die and&#10;leave ghosts, he argued, the world at last will get overcrowded with&#10;them. On that theory they would have grown innumerable some Eight&#10;Hundred Thousand Years hence, and it was no great wonder to see four&#10;at once. But the jest was unsatisfying, and I was thinking of these&#10;figures all the morning, until Weena's rescue drove them out of my&#10;head. I associated them in some indefinite way with the white animal&#10;I had startled in my first passionate search for the Time Machine.&#10;But Weena was a pleasant substitute. Yet all the same, they were&#10;soon destined to take far deadlier possession of my mind.&#10;&#10;'I think I have said how much hotter than our own was the weather&#10;of this Golden Age. I cannot account for it. It may be that the sun&#10;was hotter, or the earth nearer the sun. It is usual to assume that&#10;the sun will go on cooling steadily in the future. But people,&#10;unfamiliar with such speculations as those of the younger Darwin,&#10;forget that the planets must ultimately fall back one by one into&#10;the parent body. As these catastrophes occur, the sun will blaze&#10;with renewed energy; and it may be that some inner planet had&#10;suffered this fate. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the&#10;sun was very much hotter than we know it.&#10;&#10;'Well, one very hot morning--my fourth, I think--as I was seeking&#10;shelter from the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great&#10;house where I slept and fed, there happened this strange thing:&#10;Clambering among these heaps of masonry, I found a narrow gallery,&#10;whose end and side windows were blocked by fallen masses of stone.&#10;By contrast with the brilliancy outside, it seemed at first&#10;impenetrably dark to me. I entered it groping, for the change from&#10;light to blackness made spots of colour swim before me. Suddenly I&#10;halted spellbound. A pair of eyes, luminous by reflection against&#10;the daylight without, was watching me out of the darkness.&#10;&#10;'The old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me. I clenched&#10;my hands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs. I was&#10;afraid to turn. Then the thought of the absolute security in which&#10;humanity appeared to be living came to my mind. And then I&#10;remembered that strange terror of the dark. Overcoming my fear to&#10;some extent, I advanced a step and spoke. I will admit that my&#10;voice was harsh and ill-controlled. I put out my hand and touched&#10;something soft. At once the eyes darted sideways, and something&#10;white ran past me. I turned with my heart in my mouth, and saw a&#10;queer little ape-like figure, its head held down in a peculiar&#10;manner, running across the sunlit space behind me. It blundered&#10;against a block of granite, staggered aside, and in a moment was&#10;hidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of ruined masonry.&#10;&#10;'My impression of it is, of course, imperfect; but I know it was a&#10;dull white, and had strange large greyish-red eyes; also that there&#10;was flaxen hair on its head and down its back. But, as I say, it&#10;went too fast for me to see distinctly. I cannot even say whether it&#10;ran on all-fours, or only with its forearms held very low. After an&#10;instant's pause I followed it into the second heap of ruins. I could&#10;not find it at first; but, after a time in the profound obscurity, I&#10;came upon one of those round well-like openings of which I have told&#10;you, half closed by a fallen pillar. A sudden thought came to me.&#10;Could this Thing have vanished down the shaft? I lit a match, and,&#10;looking down, I saw a small, white, moving creature, with large&#10;bright eyes which regarded me steadfastly as it retreated. It made&#10;me shudder. It was so like a human spider! It was clambering down&#10;the wall, and now I saw for the first time a number of metal foot&#10;and hand rests forming a kind of ladder down the shaft. Then the&#10;light burned my fingers and fell out of my hand, going out as it&#10;dropped, and when I had lit another the little monster had&#10;disappeared.&#10;&#10;'I do not know how long I sat peering down that well. It was not for&#10;some time that I could succeed in persuading myself that the thing I&#10;had seen was human. But, gradually, the truth dawned on me: that&#10;Man had not remained one species, but had differentiated into two&#10;distinct animals: that my graceful children of the Upper-world were&#10;not the sole descendants of our generation, but that this bleached,&#10;obscene, nocturnal Thing, which had flashed before me, was also heir&#10;to all the ages.&#10;&#10;'I thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an&#10;underground ventilation. I began to suspect their true import. And&#10;what, I wondered, was this Lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly&#10;balanced organization? How was it related to the indolent serenity&#10;of the beautiful Upper-worlders? And what was hidden down there,&#10;at the foot of that shaft? I sat upon the edge of the well telling&#10;myself that, at any rate, there was nothing to fear, and that there&#10;I must descend for the solution of my difficulties. And withal I&#10;was absolutely afraid to go! As I hesitated, two of the beautiful&#10;Upper-world people came running in their amorous sport across the&#10;daylight in the shadow. The male pursued the female, flinging&#10;flowers at her as he ran.&#10;&#10;'They seemed distressed to find me, my arm against the overturned&#10;pillar, peering down the well. Apparently it was considered bad form&#10;to remark these apertures; for when I pointed to this one, and tried&#10;to frame a question about it in their tongue, they were still more&#10;visibly distressed and turned away. But they were interested by my&#10;matches, and I struck some to amuse them. I tried them again about&#10;the well, and again I failed. So presently I left them, meaning to&#10;go back to Weena, and see what I could get from her. But my mind was&#10;already in revolution; my guesses and impressions were slipping and&#10;sliding to a new adjustment. I had now a clue to the import of these&#10;wells, to the ventilating towers, to the mystery of the ghosts; to&#10;say nothing of a hint at the meaning of the bronze gates and the&#10;fate of the Time Machine! And very vaguely there came a suggestion&#10;towards the solution of the economic problem that had puzzled me.&#10;&#10;'Here was the new view. Plainly, this second species of Man was&#10;subterranean. There were three circumstances in particular which&#10;made me think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome&#10;of a long-continued underground habit. In the first place, there was&#10;the bleached look common in most animals that live largely in the&#10;dark--the white fish of the Kentucky caves, for instance. Then,&#10;those large eyes, with that capacity for reflecting light, are&#10;common features of nocturnal things--witness the owl and the cat.&#10;And last of all, that evident confusion in the sunshine, that hasty&#10;yet fumbling awkward flight towards dark shadow, and that peculiar&#10;carriage of the head while in the light--all reinforced the theory&#10;of an extreme sensitiveness of the retina.&#10;&#10;'Beneath my feet, then, the earth must be tunnelled enormously, and&#10;these tunnellings were the habitat of the new race. The presence of&#10;ventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopes--everywhere, in&#10;fact, except along the river valley--showed how universal were its&#10;ramifications. What so natural, then, as to assume that it was in&#10;this artificial Underworld that such work as was necessary to the&#10;comfort of the daylight race was done? The notion was so plausible&#10;that I at once accepted it, and went on to assume the _how_ of this&#10;splitting of the human species. I dare say you will anticipate the&#10;shape of my theory; though, for myself, I very soon felt that it&#10;fell far short of the truth.&#10;&#10;'At first, proceeding from the problems of our own age, it seemed&#10;clear as daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present&#10;merely temporary and social difference between the Capitalist and&#10;the Labourer, was the key to the whole position. No doubt it will&#10;seem grotesque enough to you--and wildly incredible!--and yet even&#10;now there are existing circumstances to point that way. There is&#10;a tendency to utilize underground space for the less ornamental&#10;purposes of civilization; there is the Metropolitan Railway in&#10;London, for instance, there are new electric railways, there are&#10;subways, there are underground workrooms and restaurants, and they&#10;increase and multiply. Evidently, I thought, this tendency had&#10;increased till Industry had gradually lost its birthright in the&#10;sky. I mean that it had gone deeper and deeper into larger and ever&#10;larger underground factories, spending a still-increasing amount of&#10;its time therein, till, in the end--! Even now, does not an East-end&#10;worker live in such artificial conditions as practically to be cut&#10;off from the natural surface of the earth?&#10;&#10;'Again, the exclusive tendency of richer people--due, no doubt, to&#10;the increasing refinement of their education, and the widening gulf&#10;between them and the rude violence of the poor--is already leading&#10;to the closing, in their interest, of considerable portions of the&#10;surface of the land. About London, for instance, perhaps half the&#10;prettier country is shut in against intrusion. And this same&#10;widening gulf--which is due to the length and expense of the higher&#10;educational process and the increased facilities for and temptations&#10;towards refined habits on the part of the rich--will make that&#10;exchange between class and class, that promotion by intermarriage&#10;which at present retards the splitting of our species along lines&#10;of social stratification, less and less frequent. So, in the end,&#10;above ground you must have the Haves, pursuing pleasure and comfort&#10;and beauty, and below ground the Have-nots, the Workers getting&#10;continually adapted to the conditions of their labour. Once they&#10;were there, they would no doubt have to pay rent, and not a little&#10;of it, for the ventilation of their caverns; and if they refused,&#10;they would starve or be suffocated for arrears. Such of them as were&#10;so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would die; and, in&#10;the end, the balance being permanent, the survivors would become as&#10;well adapted to the conditions of underground life, and as happy in&#10;their way, as the Upper-world people were to theirs. As it seemed to&#10;me, the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed naturally&#10;enough.&#10;&#10;'The great triumph of Humanity I had dreamed of took a different&#10;shape in my mind. It had been no such triumph of moral education and&#10;general co-operation as I had imagined. Instead, I saw a real&#10;aristocracy, armed with a perfected science and working to a logical&#10;conclusion the industrial system of to-day. Its triumph had not been&#10;simply a triumph over Nature, but a triumph over Nature and the&#10;fellow-man. This, I must warn you, was my theory at the time. I had&#10;no convenient cicerone in the pattern of the Utopian books. My&#10;explanation may be absolutely wrong. I still think it is the&#10;most plausible one. But even on this supposition the balanced&#10;civilization that was at last attained must have long since passed&#10;its zenith, and was now far fallen into decay. The too-perfect&#10;security of the Upper-worlders had led them to a slow movement of&#10;degeneration, to a general dwindling in size, strength, and&#10;intelligence. That I could see clearly enough already. What had&#10;happened to the Under-grounders I did not yet suspect; but from what&#10;I had seen of the Morlocks--that, by the by, was the name by which&#10;these creatures were called--I could imagine that the modification&#10;of the human type was even far more profound than among the &quot;Eloi,&quot;&#10;the beautiful race that I already knew.&#10;&#10;'Then came troublesome doubts. Why had the Morlocks taken my Time&#10;Machine? For I felt sure it was they who had taken it. Why, too, if&#10;the Eloi were masters, could they not restore the machine to me? And&#10;why were they so terribly afraid of the dark? I proceeded, as I have&#10;said, to question Weena about this Under-world, but here again I was&#10;disappointed. At first she would not understand my questions, and&#10;presently she refused to answer them. She shivered as though the&#10;topic was unendurable. And when I pressed her, perhaps a little&#10;harshly, she burst into tears. They were the only tears, except my&#10;own, I ever saw in that Golden Age. When I saw them I ceased&#10;abruptly to trouble about the Morlocks, and was only concerned in&#10;banishing these signs of the human inheritance from Weena's eyes.&#10;And very soon she was smiling and clapping her hands, while I&#10;solemnly burned a match.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;VI&#10;&#10;&#10;'It may seem odd to you, but it was two days before I could follow&#10;up the new-found clue in what was manifestly the proper way. I felt&#10;a peculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies. They were just the&#10;half-bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in&#10;spirit in a zoological museum. And they were filthily cold to the&#10;touch. Probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic&#10;influence of the Eloi, whose disgust of the Morlocks I now began&#10;to appreciate.&#10;&#10;'The next night I did not sleep well. Probably my health was a&#10;little disordered. I was oppressed with perplexity and doubt. Once&#10;or twice I had a feeling of intense fear for which I could perceive&#10;no definite reason. I remember creeping noiselessly into the great&#10;hall where the little people were sleeping in the moonlight--that&#10;night Weena was among them--and feeling reassured by their presence.&#10;It occurred to me even then, that in the course of a few days the&#10;moon must pass through its last quarter, and the nights grow dark,&#10;when the appearances of these unpleasant creatures from below, these&#10;whitened Lemurs, this new vermin that had replaced the old, might be&#10;more abundant. And on both these days I had the restless feeling of&#10;one who shirks an inevitable duty. I felt assured that the Time&#10;Machine was only to be recovered by boldly penetrating these&#10;underground mysteries. Yet I could not face the mystery. If only I&#10;had had a companion it would have been different. But I was so&#10;horribly alone, and even to clamber down into the darkness of the&#10;well appalled me. I don't know if you will understand my feeling,&#10;but I never felt quite safe at my back.&#10;&#10;'It was this restlessness, this insecurity, perhaps, that drove me&#10;further and further afield in my exploring expeditions. Going to the&#10;south-westward towards the rising country that is now called Combe&#10;Wood, I observed far off, in the direction of nineteenth-century&#10;Banstead, a vast green structure, different in character from any&#10;I had hitherto seen. It was larger than the largest of the palaces&#10;or ruins I knew, and the facade had an Oriental look: the face&#10;of it having the lustre, as well as the pale-green tint, a kind&#10;of bluish-green, of a certain type of Chinese porcelain. This&#10;difference in aspect suggested a difference in use, and I was minded&#10;to push on and explore. But the day was growing late, and I had come&#10;upon the sight of the place after a long and tiring circuit; so I&#10;resolved to hold over the adventure for the following day, and I&#10;returned to the welcome and the caresses of little Weena. But next&#10;morning I perceived clearly enough that my curiosity regarding the&#10;Palace of Green Porcelain was a piece of self-deception, to enable&#10;me to shirk, by another day, an experience I dreaded. I resolved I&#10;would make the descent without further waste of time, and started&#10;out in the early morning towards a well near the ruins of granite&#10;and aluminium.&#10;&#10;'Little Weena ran with me. She danced beside me to the well, but&#10;when she saw me lean over the mouth and look downward, she seemed&#10;strangely disconcerted. &quot;Good-bye, little Weena,&quot; I said, kissing&#10;her; and then putting her down, I began to feel over the parapet&#10;for the climbing hooks. Rather hastily, I may as well confess, for&#10;I feared my courage might leak away! At first she watched me in&#10;amazement. Then she gave a most piteous cry, and running to me, she&#10;began to pull at me with her little hands. I think her opposition&#10;nerved me rather to proceed. I shook her off, perhaps a little&#10;roughly, and in another moment I was in the throat of the well. I&#10;saw her agonized face over the parapet, and smiled to reassure her.&#10;Then I had to look down at the unstable hooks to which I clung.&#10;&#10;'I had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards. The&#10;descent was effected by means of metallic bars projecting from&#10;the sides of the well, and these being adapted to the needs of&#10;a creature much smaller and lighter than myself, I was speedily&#10;cramped and fatigued by the descent. And not simply fatigued! One of&#10;the bars bent suddenly under my weight, and almost swung me off into&#10;the blackness beneath. For a moment I hung by one hand, and after&#10;that experience I did not dare to rest again. Though my arms and&#10;back were presently acutely painful, I went on clambering down the&#10;sheer descent with as quick a motion as possible. Glancing upward,&#10;I saw the aperture, a small blue disk, in which a star was visible,&#10;while little Weena's head showed as a round black projection. The&#10;thudding sound of a machine below grew louder and more oppressive.&#10;Everything save that little disk above was profoundly dark, and when&#10;I looked up again Weena had disappeared.&#10;&#10;'I was in an agony of discomfort. I had some thought of trying to go&#10;up the shaft again, and leave the Under-world alone. But even while&#10;I turned this over in my mind I continued to descend. At last, with&#10;intense relief, I saw dimly coming up, a foot to the right of me, a&#10;slender loophole in the wall. Swinging myself in, I found it was the&#10;aperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which I could lie down and&#10;rest. It was not too soon. My arms ached, my back was cramped, and I&#10;was trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall. Besides this, the&#10;unbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes. The air&#10;was full of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air down the&#10;shaft.&#10;&#10;'I do not know how long I lay. I was roused by a soft hand touching&#10;my face. Starting up in the darkness I snatched at my matches and,&#10;hastily striking one, I saw three stooping white creatures similar&#10;to the one I had seen above ground in the ruin, hastily retreating&#10;before the light. Living, as they did, in what appeared to me&#10;impenetrable darkness, their eyes were abnormally large and&#10;sensitive, just as are the pupils of the abysmal fishes, and they&#10;reflected the light in the same way. I have no doubt they could see&#10;me in that rayless obscurity, and they did not seem to have any fear&#10;of me apart from the light. But, so soon as I struck a match in&#10;order to see them, they fled incontinently, vanishing into dark&#10;gutters and tunnels, from which their eyes glared at me in the&#10;strangest fashion.&#10;&#10;'I tried to call to them, but the language they had was apparently&#10;different from that of the Over-world people; so that I was needs&#10;left to my own unaided efforts, and the thought of flight before&#10;exploration was even then in my mind. But I said to myself, &quot;You are&#10;in for it now,&quot; and, feeling my way along the tunnel, I found the&#10;noise of machinery grow louder. Presently the walls fell away from&#10;me, and I came to a large open space, and striking another match,&#10;saw that I had entered a vast arched cavern, which stretched into&#10;utter darkness beyond the range of my light. The view I had of it&#10;was as much as one could see in the burning of a match.&#10;&#10;'Necessarily my memory is vague. Great shapes like big machines rose&#10;out of the dimness, and cast grotesque black shadows, in which dim&#10;spectral Morlocks sheltered from the glare. The place, by the by,&#10;was very stuffy and oppressive, and the faint halitus of freshly&#10;shed blood was in the air. Some way down the central vista was a&#10;little table of white metal, laid with what seemed a meal. The&#10;Morlocks at any rate were carnivorous! Even at the time, I remember&#10;wondering what large animal could have survived to furnish the red&#10;joint I saw. It was all very indistinct: the heavy smell, the big&#10;unmeaning shapes, the obscene figures lurking in the shadows, and&#10;only waiting for the darkness to come at me again! Then the match&#10;burned down, and stung my fingers, and fell, a wriggling red spot&#10;in the blackness.&#10;&#10;'I have thought since how particularly ill-equipped I was for such&#10;an experience. When I had started with the Time Machine, I had&#10;started with the absurd assumption that the men of the Future would&#10;certainly be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances.&#10;I had come without arms, without medicine, without anything to&#10;smoke--at times I missed tobacco frightfully--even without enough&#10;matches. If only I had thought of a Kodak! I could have flashed that&#10;glimpse of the Underworld in a second, and examined it at leisure.&#10;But, as it was, I stood there with only the weapons and the powers&#10;that Nature had endowed me with--hands, feet, and teeth; these, and&#10;four safety-matches that still remained to me.&#10;&#10;'I was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the&#10;dark, and it was only with my last glimpse of light I discovered&#10;that my store of matches had run low. It had never occurred to me&#10;until that moment that there was any need to economize them, and I&#10;had wasted almost half the box in astonishing the Upper-worlders, to&#10;whom fire was a novelty. Now, as I say, I had four left, and while I&#10;stood in the dark, a hand touched mine, lank fingers came feeling&#10;over my face, and I was sensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour. I&#10;fancied I heard the breathing of a crowd of those dreadful little&#10;beings about me. I felt the box of matches in my hand being gently&#10;disengaged, and other hands behind me plucking at my clothing. The&#10;sense of these unseen creatures examining me was indescribably&#10;unpleasant. The sudden realization of my ignorance of their ways of&#10;thinking and doing came home to me very vividly in the darkness. I&#10;shouted at them as loudly as I could. They started away, and then&#10;I could feel them approaching me again. They clutched at me more&#10;boldly, whispering odd sounds to each other. I shivered violently,&#10;and shouted again--rather discordantly. This time they were not so&#10;seriously alarmed, and they made a queer laughing noise as they came&#10;back at me. I will confess I was horribly frightened. I determined&#10;to strike another match and escape under the protection of its&#10;glare. I did so, and eking out the flicker with a scrap of paper&#10;from my pocket, I made good my retreat to the narrow tunnel. But I&#10;had scarce entered this when my light was blown out and in the&#10;blackness I could hear the Morlocks rustling like wind among leaves,&#10;and pattering like the rain, as they hurried after me.&#10;&#10;'In a moment I was clutched by several hands, and there was no&#10;mistaking that they were trying to haul me back. I struck another&#10;light, and waved it in their dazzled faces. You can scarce imagine&#10;how nauseatingly inhuman they looked--those pale, chinless faces&#10;and great, lidless, pinkish-grey eyes!--as they stared in their&#10;blindness and bewilderment. But I did not stay to look, I promise&#10;you: I retreated again, and when my second match had ended, I struck&#10;my third. It had almost burned through when I reached the opening&#10;into the shaft. I lay down on the edge, for the throb of the great&#10;pump below made me giddy. Then I felt sideways for the projecting&#10;hooks, and, as I did so, my feet were grasped from behind, and I&#10;was violently tugged backward. I lit my last match ... and it&#10;incontinently went out. But I had my hand on the climbing bars now,&#10;and, kicking violently, I disengaged myself from the clutches of the&#10;Morlocks and was speedily clambering up the shaft, while they stayed&#10;peering and blinking up at me: all but one little wretch who&#10;followed me for some way, and well-nigh secured my boot as a trophy.&#10;&#10;'That climb seemed interminable to me. With the last twenty or&#10;thirty feet of it a deadly nausea came upon me. I had the greatest&#10;difficulty in keeping my hold. The last few yards was a frightful&#10;struggle against this faintness. Several times my head swam, and I&#10;felt all the sensations of falling. At last, however, I got over the&#10;well-mouth somehow, and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding&#10;sunlight. I fell upon my face. Even the soil smelt sweet and clean.&#10;Then I remember Weena kissing my hands and ears, and the voices of&#10;others among the Eloi. Then, for a time, I was insensible.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;VII&#10;&#10;&#10;'Now, indeed, I seemed in a worse case than before. Hitherto,&#10;except during my night's anguish at the loss of the Time Machine,&#10;I had felt a sustaining hope of ultimate escape, but that hope was&#10;staggered by these new discoveries. Hitherto I had merely thought&#10;myself impeded by the childish simplicity of the little people, and&#10;by some unknown forces which I had only to understand to overcome;&#10;but there was an altogether new element in the sickening quality of&#10;the Morlocks--a something inhuman and malign. Instinctively I&#10;loathed them. Before, I had felt as a man might feel who had fallen&#10;into a pit: my concern was with the pit and how to get out of it.&#10;Now I felt like a beast in a trap, whose enemy would come upon him&#10;soon.&#10;&#10;'The enemy I dreaded may surprise you. It was the darkness of the&#10;new moon. Weena had put this into my head by some at first&#10;incomprehensible remarks about the Dark Nights. It was not now&#10;such a very difficult problem to guess what the coming Dark Nights&#10;might mean. The moon was on the wane: each night there was a longer&#10;interval of darkness. And I now understood to some slight degree at&#10;least the reason of the fear of the little Upper-world people for&#10;the dark. I wondered vaguely what foul villainy it might be that&#10;the Morlocks did under the new moon. I felt pretty sure now that&#10;my second hypothesis was all wrong. The Upper-world people might&#10;once have been the favoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks their&#10;mechanical servants: but that had long since passed away. The two&#10;species that had resulted from the evolution of man were sliding&#10;down towards, or had already arrived at, an altogether new&#10;relationship. The Eloi, like the Carolingian kings, had decayed&#10;to a mere beautiful futility. They still possessed the earth on&#10;sufferance: since the Morlocks, subterranean for innumerable&#10;generations, had come at last to find the daylit surface&#10;intolerable. And the Morlocks made their garments, I inferred, and&#10;maintained them in their habitual needs, perhaps through the&#10;survival of an old habit of service. They did it as a standing horse&#10;paws with his foot, or as a man enjoys killing animals in sport:&#10;because ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on the&#10;organism. But, clearly, the old order was already in part reversed.&#10;The Nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace. Ages ago,&#10;thousands of generations ago, man had thrust his brother man out of&#10;the ease and the sunshine. And now that brother was coming back&#10;changed! Already the Eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew.&#10;They were becoming reacquainted with Fear. And suddenly there came&#10;into my head the memory of the meat I had seen in the Under-world.&#10;It seemed odd how it floated into my mind: not stirred up as it&#10;were by the current of my meditations, but coming in almost like a&#10;question from outside. I tried to recall the form of it. I had a&#10;vague sense of something familiar, but I could not tell what it was&#10;at the time.&#10;&#10;'Still, however helpless the little people in the presence of their&#10;mysterious Fear, I was differently constituted. I came out of this&#10;age of ours, this ripe prime of the human race, when Fear does not&#10;paralyse and mystery has lost its terrors. I at least would defend&#10;myself. Without further delay I determined to make myself arms and a&#10;fastness where I might sleep. With that refuge as a base, I could&#10;face this strange world with some of that confidence I had lost in&#10;realizing to what creatures night by night I lay exposed. I felt&#10;I could never sleep again until my bed was secure from them. I&#10;shuddered with horror to think how they must already have examined&#10;me.&#10;&#10;'I wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the Thames, but&#10;found nothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible. All&#10;the buildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterous&#10;climbers as the Morlocks, to judge by their wells, must be. Then the&#10;tall pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain and the polished&#10;gleam of its walls came back to my memory; and in the evening,&#10;taking Weena like a child upon my shoulder, I went up the hills&#10;towards the south-west. The distance, I had reckoned, was seven or&#10;eight miles, but it must have been nearer eighteen. I had first seen&#10;the place on a moist afternoon when distances are deceptively&#10;diminished. In addition, the heel of one of my shoes was loose, and&#10;a nail was working through the sole--they were comfortable old shoes&#10;I wore about indoors--so that I was lame. And it was already long&#10;past sunset when I came in sight of the palace, silhouetted black&#10;against the pale yellow of the sky.&#10;&#10;'Weena had been hugely delighted when I began to carry her, but&#10;after a while she desired me to let her down, and ran along by the&#10;side of me, occasionally darting off on either hand to pick flowers&#10;to stick in my pockets. My pockets had always puzzled Weena, but at&#10;the last she had concluded that they were an eccentric kind of vase&#10;for floral decoration. At least she utilized them for that purpose.&#10;And that reminds me! In changing my jacket I found...'&#10;&#10;The Time Traveller paused, put his hand into his pocket, and&#10;silently placed two withered flowers, not unlike very large white&#10;mallows, upon the little table. Then he resumed his narrative.&#10;&#10;'As the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over&#10;the hill crest towards Wimbledon, Weena grew tired and wanted to&#10;return to the house of grey stone. But I pointed out the distant&#10;pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain to her, and contrived to&#10;make her understand that we were seeking a refuge there from her&#10;Fear. You know that great pause that comes upon things before the&#10;dusk? Even the breeze stops in the trees. To me there is always an&#10;air of expectation about that evening stillness. The sky was clear,&#10;remote, and empty save for a few horizontal bars far down in the&#10;sunset. Well, that night the expectation took the colour of my&#10;fears. In that darkling calm my senses seemed preternaturally&#10;sharpened. I fancied I could even feel the hollowness of the ground&#10;beneath my feet: could, indeed, almost see through it the Morlocks&#10;on their ant-hill going hither and thither and waiting for the dark.&#10;In my excitement I fancied that they would receive my invasion of&#10;their burrows as a declaration of war. And why had they taken my&#10;Time Machine?&#10;&#10;'So we went on in the quiet, and the twilight deepened into night.&#10;The clear blue of the distance faded, and one star after another&#10;came out. The ground grew dim and the trees black. Weena's fears and&#10;her fatigue grew upon her. I took her in my arms and talked to her&#10;and caressed her. Then, as the darkness grew deeper, she put her&#10;arms round my neck, and, closing her eyes, tightly pressed her face&#10;against my shoulder. So we went down a long slope into a valley, and&#10;there in the dimness I almost walked into a little river. This I&#10;waded, and went up the opposite side of the valley, past a number&#10;of sleeping houses, and by a statue--a Faun, or some such figure,&#10;_minus_ the head. Here too were acacias. So far I had seen nothing of&#10;the Morlocks, but it was yet early in the night, and the darker hours&#10;before the old moon rose were still to come.&#10;&#10;'From the brow of the next hill I saw a thick wood spreading wide&#10;and black before me. I hesitated at this. I could see no end to&#10;it, either to the right or the left. Feeling tired--my feet, in&#10;particular, were very sore--I carefully lowered Weena from my&#10;shoulder as I halted, and sat down upon the turf. I could no&#10;longer see the Palace of Green Porcelain, and I was in doubt of my&#10;direction. I looked into the thickness of the wood and thought of&#10;what it might hide. Under that dense tangle of branches one would&#10;be out of sight of the stars. Even were there no other lurking&#10;danger--a danger I did not care to let my imagination loose&#10;upon--there would still be all the roots to stumble over and the&#10;tree-boles to strike against.&#10;&#10;'I was very tired, too, after the excitements of the day; so I&#10;decided that I would not face it, but would pass the night upon the&#10;open hill.&#10;&#10;'Weena, I was glad to find, was fast asleep. I carefully wrapped her&#10;in my jacket, and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise. The&#10;hill-side was quiet and deserted, but from the black of the wood&#10;there came now and then a stir of living things. Above me shone the&#10;stars, for the night was very clear. I felt a certain sense of&#10;friendly comfort in their twinkling. All the old constellations&#10;had gone from the sky, however: that slow movement which is&#10;imperceptible in a hundred human lifetimes, had long since&#10;rearranged them in unfamiliar groupings. But the Milky Way, it&#10;seemed to me, was still the same tattered streamer of star-dust as&#10;of yore. Southward (as I judged it) was a very bright red star that&#10;was new to me; it was even more splendid than our own green Sirius.&#10;And amid all these scintillating points of light one bright planet&#10;shone kindly and steadily like the face of an old friend.&#10;&#10;'Looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all&#10;the gravities of terrestrial life. I thought of their unfathomable&#10;distance, and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of&#10;the unknown past into the unknown future. I thought of the great&#10;precessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes. Only forty&#10;times had that silent revolution occurred during all the years that&#10;I had traversed. And during these few revolutions all the activity,&#10;all the traditions, the complex organizations, the nations,&#10;languages, literatures, aspirations, even the mere memory of Man as&#10;I knew him, had been swept out of existence. Instead were these&#10;frail creatures who had forgotten their high ancestry, and the white&#10;Things of which I went in terror. Then I thought of the Great Fear&#10;that was between the two species, and for the first time, with a&#10;sudden shiver, came the clear knowledge of what the meat I had seen&#10;might be. Yet it was too horrible! I looked at little Weena sleeping&#10;beside me, her face white and starlike under the stars, and&#10;forthwith dismissed the thought.&#10;&#10;'Through that long night I held my mind off the Morlocks as well as&#10;I could, and whiled away the time by trying to fancy I could find&#10;signs of the old constellations in the new confusion. The sky kept&#10;very clear, except for a hazy cloud or so. No doubt I dozed at&#10;times. Then, as my vigil wore on, came a faintness in the eastward&#10;sky, like the reflection of some colourless fire, and the old moon&#10;rose, thin and peaked and white. And close behind, and overtaking&#10;it, and overflowing it, the dawn came, pale at first, and then&#10;growing pink and warm. No Morlocks had approached us. Indeed, I had&#10;seen none upon the hill that night. And in the confidence of renewed&#10;day it almost seemed to me that my fear had been unreasonable. I&#10;stood up and found my foot with the loose heel swollen at the ankle&#10;and painful under the heel; so I sat down again, took off my shoes,&#10;and flung them away.&#10;&#10;'I awakened Weena, and we went down into the wood, now green and&#10;pleasant instead of black and forbidding. We found some fruit&#10;wherewith to break our fast. We soon met others of the dainty ones,&#10;laughing and dancing in the sunlight as though there was no such&#10;thing in nature as the night. And then I thought once more of the&#10;meat that I had seen. I felt assured now of what it was, and from&#10;the bottom of my heart I pitied this last feeble rill from the great&#10;flood of humanity. Clearly, at some time in the Long-Ago of human&#10;decay the Morlocks' food had run short. Possibly they had lived on&#10;rats and such-like vermin. Even now man is far less discriminating&#10;and exclusive in his food than he was--far less than any monkey. His&#10;prejudice against human flesh is no deep-seated instinct. And so&#10;these inhuman sons of men----! I tried to look at the thing in a&#10;scientific spirit. After all, they were less human and more remote&#10;than our cannibal ancestors of three or four thousand years ago.&#10;And the intelligence that would have made this state of things a&#10;torment had gone. Why should I trouble myself? These Eloi were mere&#10;fatted cattle, which the ant-like Morlocks preserved and preyed&#10;upon--probably saw to the breeding of. And there was Weena dancing&#10;at my side!&#10;&#10;'Then I tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming&#10;upon me, by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human&#10;selfishness. Man had been content to live in ease and delight upon&#10;the labours of his fellow-man, had taken Necessity as his watchword&#10;and excuse, and in the fullness of time Necessity had come home to&#10;him. I even tried a Carlyle-like scorn of this wretched aristocracy&#10;in decay. But this attitude of mind was impossible. However great&#10;their intellectual degradation, the Eloi had kept too much of the&#10;human form not to claim my sympathy, and to make me perforce a&#10;sharer in their degradation and their Fear.&#10;&#10;'I had at that time very vague ideas as to the course I should&#10;pursue. My first was to secure some safe place of refuge, and to&#10;make myself such arms of metal or stone as I could contrive. That&#10;necessity was immediate. In the next place, I hoped to procure some&#10;means of fire, so that I should have the weapon of a torch at hand,&#10;for nothing, I knew, would be more efficient against these Morlocks.&#10;Then I wanted to arrange some contrivance to break open the doors of&#10;bronze under the White Sphinx. I had in mind a battering ram. I had&#10;a persuasion that if I could enter those doors and carry a blaze of&#10;light before me I should discover the Time Machine and escape. I&#10;could not imagine the Morlocks were strong enough to move it far&#10;away. Weena I had resolved to bring with me to our own time. And&#10;turning such schemes over in my mind I pursued our way towards the&#10;building which my fancy had chosen as our dwelling.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;VIII&#10;&#10;&#10;'I found the Palace of Green Porcelain, when we approached it about&#10;noon, deserted and falling into ruin. Only ragged vestiges of glass&#10;remained in its windows, and great sheets of the green facing had&#10;fallen away from the corroded metallic framework. It lay very high&#10;upon a turfy down, and looking north-eastward before I entered it, I&#10;was surprised to see a large estuary, or even creek, where I judged&#10;Wandsworth and Battersea must once have been. I thought then--though&#10;I never followed up the thought--of what might have happened, or&#10;might be happening, to the living things in the sea.&#10;&#10;'The material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeed&#10;porcelain, and along the face of it I saw an inscription in some&#10;unknown character. I thought, rather foolishly, that Weena might&#10;help me to interpret this, but I only learned that the bare idea of&#10;writing had never entered her head. She always seemed to me, I&#10;fancy, more human than she was, perhaps because her affection was so&#10;human.&#10;&#10;'Within the big valves of the door--which were open and broken--we&#10;found, instead of the customary hall, a long gallery lit by many&#10;side windows. At the first glance I was reminded of a museum.&#10;The tiled floor was thick with dust, and a remarkable array of&#10;miscellaneous objects was shrouded in the same grey covering. Then&#10;I perceived, standing strange and gaunt in the centre of the hall,&#10;what was clearly the lower part of a huge skeleton. I recognized&#10;by the oblique feet that it was some extinct creature after the&#10;fashion of the Megatherium. The skull and the upper bones lay&#10;beside it in the thick dust, and in one place, where rain-water had&#10;dropped through a leak in the roof, the thing itself had been worn&#10;away. Further in the gallery was the huge skeleton barrel of a&#10;Brontosaurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Going towards the&#10;side I found what appeared to be sloping shelves, and clearing away&#10;the thick dust, I found the old familiar glass cases of our own&#10;time. But they must have been air-tight to judge from the fair&#10;preservation of some of their contents.&#10;&#10;'Clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter-day South&#10;Kensington! Here, apparently, was the Palaeontological Section,&#10;and a very splendid array of fossils it must have been, though the&#10;inevitable process of decay that had been staved off for a time, and&#10;had, through the extinction of bacteria and fungi, lost ninety-nine&#10;hundredths of its force, was nevertheless, with extreme sureness if&#10;with extreme slowness at work again upon all its treasures. Here and&#10;there I found traces of the little people in the shape of rare&#10;fossils broken to pieces or threaded in strings upon reeds. And the&#10;cases had in some instances been bodily removed--by the Morlocks as&#10;I judged. The place was very silent. The thick dust deadened our&#10;footsteps. Weena, who had been rolling a sea urchin down the sloping&#10;glass of a case, presently came, as I stared about me, and very&#10;quietly took my hand and stood beside me.&#10;&#10;'And at first I was so much surprised by this ancient monument of an&#10;intellectual age, that I gave no thought to the possibilities it&#10;presented. Even my preoccupation about the Time Machine receded a&#10;little from my mind.&#10;&#10;'To judge from the size of the place, this Palace of Green Porcelain&#10;had a great deal more in it than a Gallery of Palaeontology;&#10;possibly historical galleries; it might be, even a library! To me,&#10;at least in my present circumstances, these would be vastly more&#10;interesting than this spectacle of oldtime geology in decay.&#10;Exploring, I found another short gallery running transversely to the&#10;first. This appeared to be devoted to minerals, and the sight of a&#10;block of sulphur set my mind running on gunpowder. But I could find&#10;no saltpeter; indeed, no nitrates of any kind. Doubtless they had&#10;deliquesced ages ago. Yet the sulphur hung in my mind, and set up a&#10;train of thinking. As for the rest of the contents of that gallery,&#10;though on the whole they were the best preserved of all I saw, I had&#10;little interest. I am no specialist in mineralogy, and I went on&#10;down a very ruinous aisle running parallel to the first hall I had&#10;entered. Apparently this section had been devoted to natural&#10;history, but everything had long since passed out of recognition. A&#10;few shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had once been stuffed&#10;animals, desiccated mummies in jars that had once held spirit, a&#10;brown dust of departed plants: that was all! I was sorry for that,&#10;because I should have been glad to trace the patent readjustments by&#10;which the conquest of animated nature had been attained. Then we&#10;came to a gallery of simply colossal proportions, but singularly&#10;ill-lit, the floor of it running downward at a slight angle from the&#10;end at which I entered. At intervals white globes hung from the&#10;ceiling--many of them cracked and smashed--which suggested that&#10;originally the place had been artificially lit. Here I was more in&#10;my element, for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of&#10;big machines, all greatly corroded and many broken down, but some&#10;still fairly complete. You know I have a certain weakness for&#10;mechanism, and I was inclined to linger among these; the more so as&#10;for the most part they had the interest of puzzles, and I could make&#10;only the vaguest guesses at what they were for. I fancied that if&#10;I could solve their puzzles I should find myself in possession of&#10;powers that might be of use against the Morlocks.&#10;&#10;'Suddenly Weena came very close to my side. So suddenly that she&#10;startled me. Had it not been for her I do not think I should have&#10;noticed that the floor of the gallery sloped at all. [Footnote: It&#10;may be, of course, that the floor did not slope, but that the museum&#10;was built into the side of a hill.--ED.] The end I had come in at&#10;was quite above ground, and was lit by rare slit-like windows. As&#10;you went down the length, the ground came up against these windows,&#10;until at last there was a pit like the &quot;area&quot; of a London house&#10;before each, and only a narrow line of daylight at the top. I went&#10;slowly along, puzzling about the machines, and had been too intent&#10;upon them to notice the gradual diminution of the light, until&#10;Weena's increasing apprehensions drew my attention. Then I saw that&#10;the gallery ran down at last into a thick darkness. I hesitated, and&#10;then, as I looked round me, I saw that the dust was less abundant&#10;and its surface less even. Further away towards the dimness, it&#10;appeared to be broken by a number of small narrow footprints. My&#10;sense of the immediate presence of the Morlocks revived at that.&#10;I felt that I was wasting my time in the academic examination of&#10;machinery. I called to mind that it was already far advanced in the&#10;afternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge, and no means&#10;of making a fire. And then down in the remote blackness of the&#10;gallery I heard a peculiar pattering, and the same odd noises I had&#10;heard down the well.&#10;&#10;'I took Weena's hand. Then, struck with a sudden idea, I left her&#10;and turned to a machine from which projected a lever not unlike&#10;those in a signal-box. Clambering upon the stand, and grasping this&#10;lever in my hands, I put all my weight upon it sideways. Suddenly&#10;Weena, deserted in the central aisle, began to whimper. I had judged&#10;the strength of the lever pretty correctly, for it snapped after a&#10;minute's strain, and I rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than&#10;sufficient, I judged, for any Morlock skull I might encounter. And I&#10;longed very much to kill a Morlock or so. Very inhuman, you may&#10;think, to want to go killing one's own descendants! But it was&#10;impossible, somehow, to feel any humanity in the things. Only my&#10;disinclination to leave Weena, and a persuasion that if I began to&#10;slake my thirst for murder my Time Machine might suffer, restrained&#10;me from going straight down the gallery and killing the brutes I&#10;heard.&#10;&#10;'Well, mace in one hand and Weena in the other, I went out of that&#10;gallery and into another and still larger one, which at the first&#10;glance reminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags.&#10;The brown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it, I&#10;presently recognized as the decaying vestiges of books. They had&#10;long since dropped to pieces, and every semblance of print had left&#10;them. But here and there were warped boards and cracked metallic&#10;clasps that told the tale well enough. Had I been a literary man I&#10;might, perhaps, have moralized upon the futility of all ambition.&#10;But as it was, the thing that struck me with keenest force was the&#10;enormous waste of labour to which this sombre wilderness of rotting&#10;paper testified. At the time I will confess that I thought chiefly&#10;of the _Philosophical Transactions_ and my own seventeen papers upon&#10;physical optics.&#10;&#10;'Then, going up a broad staircase, we came to what may once have&#10;been a gallery of technical chemistry. And here I had not a little&#10;hope of useful discoveries. Except at one end where the roof had&#10;collapsed, this gallery was well preserved. I went eagerly to every&#10;unbroken case. And at last, in one of the really air-tight cases,&#10;I found a box of matches. Very eagerly I tried them. They were&#10;perfectly good. They were not even damp. I turned to Weena. &quot;Dance,&quot;&#10;I cried to her in her own tongue. For now I had a weapon indeed&#10;against the horrible creatures we feared. And so, in that derelict&#10;museum, upon the thick soft carpeting of dust, to Weena's huge&#10;delight, I solemnly performed a kind of composite dance, whistling&#10;_The Land of the Leal_ as cheerfully as I could. In part it was a&#10;modest _cancan_, in part a step dance, in part a skirt-dance (so far&#10;as my tail-coat permitted), and in part original. For I am naturally&#10;inventive, as you know.&#10;&#10;'Now, I still think that for this box of matches to have escaped&#10;the wear of time for immemorial years was a most strange, as for&#10;me it was a most fortunate thing. Yet, oddly enough, I found a far&#10;unlikelier substance, and that was camphor. I found it in a sealed&#10;jar, that by chance, I suppose, had been really hermetically sealed.&#10;I fancied at first that it was paraffin wax, and smashed the glass&#10;accordingly. But the odour of camphor was unmistakable. In the&#10;universal decay this volatile substance had chanced to survive,&#10;perhaps through many thousands of centuries. It reminded me of a&#10;sepia painting I had once seen done from the ink of a fossil&#10;Belemnite that must have perished and become fossilized millions&#10;of years ago. I was about to throw it away, but I remembered that&#10;it was inflammable and burned with a good bright flame--was, in&#10;fact, an excellent candle--and I put it in my pocket. I found no&#10;explosives, however, nor any means of breaking down the bronze&#10;doors. As yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing I had&#10;chanced upon. Nevertheless I left that gallery greatly elated.&#10;&#10;'I cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon. It would&#10;require a great effort of memory to recall my explorations in at all&#10;the proper order. I remember a long gallery of rusting stands of&#10;arms, and how I hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a&#10;sword. I could not carry both, however, and my bar of iron promised&#10;best against the bronze gates. There were numbers of guns, pistols,&#10;and rifles. The most were masses of rust, but many were of some&#10;new metal, and still fairly sound. But any cartridges or powder&#10;there may once have been had rotted into dust. One corner I saw was&#10;charred and shattered; perhaps, I thought, by an explosion among the&#10;specimens. In another place was a vast array of idols--Polynesian,&#10;Mexican, Grecian, Phoenician, every country on earth I should think.&#10;And here, yielding to an irresistible impulse, I wrote my name upon&#10;the nose of a steatite monster from South America that particularly&#10;took my fancy.&#10;&#10;'As the evening drew on, my interest waned. I went through gallery&#10;after gallery, dusty, silent, often ruinous, the exhibits sometimes&#10;mere heaps of rust and lignite, sometimes fresher. In one place I&#10;suddenly found myself near the model of a tin-mine, and then by the&#10;merest accident I discovered, in an air-tight case, two dynamite&#10;cartridges! I shouted &quot;Eureka!&quot; and smashed the case with joy. Then&#10;came a doubt. I hesitated. Then, selecting a little side gallery,&#10;I made my essay. I never felt such a disappointment as I did in&#10;waiting five, ten, fifteen minutes for an explosion that never came.&#10;Of course the things were dummies, as I might have guessed from&#10;their presence. I really believe that had they not been so, I should&#10;have rushed off incontinently and blown Sphinx, bronze doors, and&#10;(as it proved) my chances of finding the Time Machine, all together&#10;into non-existence.&#10;&#10;'It was after that, I think, that we came to a little open court&#10;within the palace. It was turfed, and had three fruit-trees. So we&#10;rested and refreshed ourselves. Towards sunset I began to consider&#10;our position. Night was creeping upon us, and my inaccessible&#10;hiding-place had still to be found. But that troubled me very little&#10;now. I had in my possession a thing that was, perhaps, the best of&#10;all defences against the Morlocks--I had matches! I had the camphor&#10;in my pocket, too, if a blaze were needed. It seemed to me that&#10;the best thing we could do would be to pass the night in the open,&#10;protected by a fire. In the morning there was the getting of the&#10;Time Machine. Towards that, as yet, I had only my iron mace. But&#10;now, with my growing knowledge, I felt very differently towards&#10;those bronze doors. Up to this, I had refrained from forcing them,&#10;largely because of the mystery on the other side. They had never&#10;impressed me as being very strong, and I hoped to find my bar of&#10;iron not altogether inadequate for the work.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;IX&#10;&#10;&#10;'We emerged from the palace while the sun was still in part above&#10;the horizon. I was determined to reach the White Sphinx early the&#10;next morning, and ere the dusk I purposed pushing through the woods&#10;that had stopped me on the previous journey. My plan was to go as&#10;far as possible that night, and then, building a fire, to sleep&#10;in the protection of its glare. Accordingly, as we went along I&#10;gathered any sticks or dried grass I saw, and presently had my arms&#10;full of such litter. Thus loaded, our progress was slower than I had&#10;anticipated, and besides Weena was tired. And I began to suffer from&#10;sleepiness too; so that it was full night before we reached the&#10;wood. Upon the shrubby hill of its edge Weena would have stopped,&#10;fearing the darkness before us; but a singular sense of impending&#10;calamity, that should indeed have served me as a warning, drove me&#10;onward. I had been without sleep for a night and two days, and I was&#10;feverish and irritable. I felt sleep coming upon me, and the&#10;Morlocks with it.&#10;&#10;'While we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, and dim&#10;against their blackness, I saw three crouching figures. There was&#10;scrub and long grass all about us, and I did not feel safe from&#10;their insidious approach. The forest, I calculated, was rather&#10;less than a mile across. If we could get through it to the bare&#10;hill-side, there, as it seemed to me, was an altogether safer&#10;resting-place; I thought that with my matches and my camphor I could&#10;contrive to keep my path illuminated through the woods. Yet it was&#10;evident that if I was to flourish matches with my hands I should&#10;have to abandon my firewood; so, rather reluctantly, I put it down.&#10;And then it came into my head that I would amaze our friends behind&#10;by lighting it. I was to discover the atrocious folly of this&#10;proceeding, but it came to my mind as an ingenious move for covering&#10;our retreat.&#10;&#10;'I don't know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must&#10;be in the absence of man and in a temperate climate. The sun's&#10;heat is rarely strong enough to burn, even when it is focused by&#10;dewdrops, as is sometimes the case in more tropical districts.&#10;Lightning may blast and blacken, but it rarely gives rise to&#10;widespread fire. Decaying vegetation may occasionally smoulder with&#10;the heat of its fermentation, but this rarely results in flame. In&#10;this decadence, too, the art of fire-making had been forgotten on&#10;the earth. The red tongues that went licking up my heap of wood were&#10;an altogether new and strange thing to Weena.&#10;&#10;'She wanted to run to it and play with it. I believe she would have&#10;cast herself into it had I not restrained her. But I caught her up,&#10;and in spite of her struggles, plunged boldly before me into the&#10;wood. For a little way the glare of my fire lit the path. Looking&#10;back presently, I could see, through the crowded stems, that from my&#10;heap of sticks the blaze had spread to some bushes adjacent, and a&#10;curved line of fire was creeping up the grass of the hill. I laughed&#10;at that, and turned again to the dark trees before me. It was very&#10;black, and Weena clung to me convulsively, but there was still, as&#10;my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, sufficient light for me to&#10;avoid the stems. Overhead it was simply black, except where a gap of&#10;remote blue sky shone down upon us here and there. I struck none of&#10;my matches because I had no hand free. Upon my left arm I carried my&#10;little one, in my right hand I had my iron bar.&#10;&#10;'For some way I heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet,&#10;the faint rustle of the breeze above, and my own breathing and the&#10;throb of the blood-vessels in my ears. Then I seemed to know of a&#10;pattering about me. I pushed on grimly. The pattering grew more&#10;distinct, and then I caught the same queer sound and voices I had&#10;heard in the Under-world. There were evidently several of the&#10;Morlocks, and they were closing in upon me. Indeed, in another&#10;minute I felt a tug at my coat, then something at my arm. And Weena&#10;shivered violently, and became quite still.&#10;&#10;'It was time for a match. But to get one I must put her down. I did&#10;so, and, as I fumbled with my pocket, a struggle began in the&#10;darkness about my knees, perfectly silent on her part and with the&#10;same peculiar cooing sounds from the Morlocks. Soft little hands,&#10;too, were creeping over my coat and back, touching even my neck.&#10;Then the match scratched and fizzed. I held it flaring, and saw the&#10;white backs of the Morlocks in flight amid the trees. I hastily took&#10;a lump of camphor from my pocket, and prepared to light it as soon&#10;as the match should wane. Then I looked at Weena. She was lying&#10;clutching my feet and quite motionless, with her face to the ground.&#10;With a sudden fright I stooped to her. She seemed scarcely to&#10;breathe. I lit the block of camphor and flung it to the ground,&#10;and as it split and flared up and drove back the Morlocks and the&#10;shadows, I knelt down and lifted her. The wood behind seemed full of&#10;the stir and murmur of a great company!&#10;&#10;'She seemed to have fainted. I put her carefully upon my shoulder&#10;and rose to push on, and then there came a horrible realization. In&#10;manoeuvring with my matches and Weena, I had turned myself about&#10;several times, and now I had not the faintest idea in what direction&#10;lay my path. For all I knew, I might be facing back towards the&#10;Palace of Green Porcelain. I found myself in a cold sweat. I had to&#10;think rapidly what to do. I determined to build a fire and encamp&#10;where we were. I put Weena, still motionless, down upon a turfy&#10;bole, and very hastily, as my first lump of camphor waned, I began&#10;collecting sticks and leaves. Here and there out of the darkness&#10;round me the Morlocks' eyes shone like carbuncles.&#10;&#10;'The camphor flickered and went out. I lit a match, and as I did so,&#10;two white forms that had been approaching Weena dashed hastily away.&#10;One was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me, and I&#10;felt his bones grind under the blow of my fist. He gave a whoop of&#10;dismay, staggered a little way, and fell down. I lit another piece&#10;of camphor, and went on gathering my bonfire. Presently I noticed&#10;how dry was some of the foliage above me, for since my arrival&#10;on the Time Machine, a matter of a week, no rain had fallen. So,&#10;instead of casting about among the trees for fallen twigs, I began&#10;leaping up and dragging down branches. Very soon I had a choking&#10;smoky fire of green wood and dry sticks, and could economize my&#10;camphor. Then I turned to where Weena lay beside my iron mace. I&#10;tried what I could to revive her, but she lay like one dead. I could&#10;not even satisfy myself whether or not she breathed.&#10;&#10;'Now, the smoke of the fire beat over towards me, and it must have&#10;made me heavy of a sudden. Moreover, the vapour of camphor was in&#10;the air. My fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so. I&#10;felt very weary after my exertion, and sat down. The wood, too, was&#10;full of a slumbrous murmur that I did not understand. I seemed just&#10;to nod and open my eyes. But all was dark, and the Morlocks had&#10;their hands upon me. Flinging off their clinging fingers I hastily&#10;felt in my pocket for the match-box, and--it had gone! Then they&#10;gripped and closed with me again. In a moment I knew what had&#10;happened. I had slept, and my fire had gone out, and the bitterness&#10;of death came over my soul. The forest seemed full of the smell of&#10;burning wood. I was caught by the neck, by the hair, by the arms,&#10;and pulled down. It was indescribably horrible in the darkness to&#10;feel all these soft creatures heaped upon me. I felt as if I was in&#10;a monstrous spider's web. I was overpowered, and went down. I felt&#10;little teeth nipping at my neck. I rolled over, and as I did so my&#10;hand came against my iron lever. It gave me strength. I struggled&#10;up, shaking the human rats from me, and, holding the bar short,&#10;I thrust where I judged their faces might be. I could feel the&#10;succulent giving of flesh and bone under my blows, and for a moment&#10;I was free.&#10;&#10;'The strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard&#10;fighting came upon me. I knew that both I and Weena were lost, but I&#10;determined to make the Morlocks pay for their meat. I stood with my&#10;back to a tree, swinging the iron bar before me. The whole wood was&#10;full of the stir and cries of them. A minute passed. Their voices&#10;seemed to rise to a higher pitch of excitement, and their movements&#10;grew faster. Yet none came within reach. I stood glaring at the&#10;blackness. Then suddenly came hope. What if the Morlocks were&#10;afraid? And close on the heels of that came a strange thing. The&#10;darkness seemed to grow luminous. Very dimly I began to see the&#10;Morlocks about me--three battered at my feet--and then I recognized,&#10;with incredulous surprise, that the others were running, in an&#10;incessant stream, as it seemed, from behind me, and away through the&#10;wood in front. And their backs seemed no longer white, but reddish.&#10;As I stood agape, I saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap&#10;of starlight between the branches, and vanish. And at that I&#10;understood the smell of burning wood, the slumbrous murmur that was&#10;growing now into a gusty roar, the red glow, and the Morlocks'&#10;flight.&#10;&#10;'Stepping out from behind my tree and looking back, I saw, through&#10;the black pillars of the nearer trees, the flames of the burning&#10;forest. It was my first fire coming after me. With that I looked for&#10;Weena, but she was gone. The hissing and crackling behind me, the&#10;explosive thud as each fresh tree burst into flame, left little&#10;time for reflection. My iron bar still gripped, I followed in the&#10;Morlocks' path. It was a close race. Once the flames crept forward&#10;so swiftly on my right as I ran that I was outflanked and had to&#10;strike off to the left. But at last I emerged upon a small open&#10;space, and as I did so, a Morlock came blundering towards me, and&#10;past me, and went on straight into the fire!&#10;&#10;'And now I was to see the most weird and horrible thing, I think, of&#10;all that I beheld in that future age. This whole space was as bright&#10;as day with the reflection of the fire. In the centre was a hillock&#10;or tumulus, surmounted by a scorched hawthorn. Beyond this was&#10;another arm of the burning forest, with yellow tongues already&#10;writhing from it, completely encircling the space with a fence of&#10;fire. Upon the hill-side were some thirty or forty Morlocks, dazzled&#10;by the light and heat, and blundering hither and thither against&#10;each other in their bewilderment. At first I did not realize their&#10;blindness, and struck furiously at them with my bar, in a frenzy of&#10;fear, as they approached me, killing one and crippling several more.&#10;But when I had watched the gestures of one of them groping under the&#10;hawthorn against the red sky, and heard their moans, I was assured&#10;of their absolute helplessness and misery in the glare, and I struck&#10;no more of them.&#10;&#10;'Yet every now and then one would come straight towards me, setting&#10;loose a quivering horror that made me quick to elude him. At one&#10;time the flames died down somewhat, and I feared the foul creatures&#10;would presently be able to see me. I was thinking of beginning the&#10;fight by killing some of them before this should happen; but the&#10;fire burst out again brightly, and I stayed my hand. I walked about&#10;the hill among them and avoided them, looking for some trace of&#10;Weena. But Weena was gone.&#10;&#10;'At last I sat down on the summit of the hillock, and watched this&#10;strange incredible company of blind things groping to and fro, and&#10;making uncanny noises to each other, as the glare of the fire beat&#10;on them. The coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky, and&#10;through the rare tatters of that red canopy, remote as though they&#10;belonged to another universe, shone the little stars. Two or three&#10;Morlocks came blundering into me, and I drove them off with blows&#10;of my fists, trembling as I did so.&#10;&#10;'For the most part of that night I was persuaded it was a nightmare.&#10;I bit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake. I beat&#10;the ground with my hands, and got up and sat down again, and&#10;wandered here and there, and again sat down. Then I would fall to&#10;rubbing my eyes and calling upon God to let me awake. Thrice I saw&#10;Morlocks put their heads down in a kind of agony and rush into the&#10;flames. But, at last, above the subsiding red of the fire, above the&#10;streaming masses of black smoke and the whitening and blackening&#10;tree stumps, and the diminishing numbers of these dim creatures,&#10;came the white light of the day.&#10;&#10;'I searched again for traces of Weena, but there were none. It was&#10;plain that they had left her poor little body in the forest. I&#10;cannot describe how it relieved me to think that it had escaped the&#10;awful fate to which it seemed destined. As I thought of that, I was&#10;almost moved to begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about&#10;me, but I contained myself. The hillock, as I have said, was a kind&#10;of island in the forest. From its summit I could now make out&#10;through a haze of smoke the Palace of Green Porcelain, and from that&#10;I could get my bearings for the White Sphinx. And so, leaving the&#10;remnant of these damned souls still going hither and thither and&#10;moaning, as the day grew clearer, I tied some grass about my feet&#10;and limped on across smoking ashes and among black stems, that still&#10;pulsated internally with fire, towards the hiding-place of the Time&#10;Machine. I walked slowly, for I was almost exhausted, as well as&#10;lame, and I felt the intensest wretchedness for the horrible death&#10;of little Weena. It seemed an overwhelming calamity. Now, in this&#10;old familiar room, it is more like the sorrow of a dream than an&#10;actual loss. But that morning it left me absolutely lonely&#10;again--terribly alone. I began to think of this house of mine, of&#10;this fireside, of some of you, and with such thoughts came a longing&#10;that was pain.&#10;&#10;'But as I walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morning&#10;sky, I made a discovery. In my trouser pocket were still some loose&#10;matches. The box must have leaked before it was lost.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;X&#10;&#10;&#10;'About eight or nine in the morning I came to the same seat of&#10;yellow metal from which I had viewed the world upon the evening of&#10;my arrival. I thought of my hasty conclusions upon that evening and&#10;could not refrain from laughing bitterly at my confidence. Here&#10;was the same beautiful scene, the same abundant foliage, the same&#10;splendid palaces and magnificent ruins, the same silver river&#10;running between its fertile banks. The gay robes of the beautiful&#10;people moved hither and thither among the trees. Some were bathing&#10;in exactly the place where I had saved Weena, and that suddenly gave&#10;me a keen stab of pain. And like blots upon the landscape rose the&#10;cupolas above the ways to the Under-world. I understood now what all&#10;the beauty of the Over-world people covered. Very pleasant was their&#10;day, as pleasant as the day of the cattle in the field. Like the&#10;cattle, they knew of no enemies and provided against no needs. And&#10;their end was the same.&#10;&#10;'I grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect had&#10;been. It had committed suicide. It had set itself steadfastly&#10;towards comfort and ease, a balanced society with security and&#10;permanency as its watchword, it had attained its hopes--to come&#10;to this at last. Once, life and property must have reached almost&#10;absolute safety. The rich had been assured of his wealth and&#10;comfort, the toiler assured of his life and work. No doubt in that&#10;perfect world there had been no unemployed problem, no social&#10;question left unsolved. And a great quiet had followed.&#10;&#10;'It is a law of nature we overlook, that intellectual versatility&#10;is the compensation for change, danger, and trouble. An animal&#10;perfectly in harmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism.&#10;Nature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are&#10;useless. There is no intelligence where there is no change and no&#10;need of change. Only those animals partake of intelligence that have&#10;to meet a huge variety of needs and dangers.&#10;&#10;'So, as I see it, the Upper-world man had drifted towards his&#10;feeble prettiness, and the Under-world to mere mechanical industry.&#10;But that perfect state had lacked one thing even for mechanical&#10;perfection--absolute permanency. Apparently as time went on, the&#10;feeding of the Under-world, however it was effected, had become&#10;disjointed. Mother Necessity, who had been staved off for a&#10;few thousand years, came back again, and she began below. The&#10;Under-world being in contact with machinery, which, however perfect,&#10;still needs some little thought outside habit, had probably retained&#10;perforce rather more initiative, if less of every other human&#10;character, than the Upper. And when other meat failed them, they&#10;turned to what old habit had hitherto forbidden. So I say I saw it&#10;in my last view of the world of Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven&#10;Hundred and One. It may be as wrong an explanation as mortal wit&#10;could invent. It is how the thing shaped itself to me, and as that I&#10;give it to you.&#10;&#10;'After the fatigues, excitements, and terrors of the past days, and&#10;in spite of my grief, this seat and the tranquil view and the warm&#10;sunlight were very pleasant. I was very tired and sleepy, and soon&#10;my theorizing passed into dozing. Catching myself at that, I took my&#10;own hint, and spreading myself out upon the turf I had a long and&#10;refreshing sleep.&#10;&#10;'I awoke a little before sunsetting. I now felt safe against being&#10;caught napping by the Morlocks, and, stretching myself, I came on&#10;down the hill towards the White Sphinx. I had my crowbar in one&#10;hand, and the other hand played with the matches in my pocket.&#10;&#10;'And now came a most unexpected thing. As I approached the pedestal&#10;of the sphinx I found the bronze valves were open. They had slid&#10;down into grooves.&#10;&#10;'At that I stopped short before them, hesitating to enter.&#10;&#10;'Within was a small apartment, and on a raised place in the corner&#10;of this was the Time Machine. I had the small levers in my pocket.&#10;So here, after all my elaborate preparations for the siege of the&#10;White Sphinx, was a meek surrender. I threw my iron bar away, almost&#10;sorry not to use it.&#10;&#10;'A sudden thought came into my head as I stooped towards the portal.&#10;For once, at least, I grasped the mental operations of the Morlocks.&#10;Suppressing a strong inclination to laugh, I stepped through the&#10;bronze frame and up to the Time Machine. I was surprised to find it&#10;had been carefully oiled and cleaned. I have suspected since that&#10;the Morlocks had even partially taken it to pieces while trying in&#10;their dim way to grasp its purpose.&#10;&#10;'Now as I stood and examined it, finding a pleasure in the mere&#10;touch of the contrivance, the thing I had expected happened. The&#10;bronze panels suddenly slid up and struck the frame with a clang.&#10;I was in the dark--trapped. So the Morlocks thought. At that I&#10;chuckled gleefully.&#10;&#10;'I could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came towards&#10;me. Very calmly I tried to strike the match. I had only to fix on&#10;the levers and depart then like a ghost. But I had overlooked one&#10;little thing. The matches were of that abominable kind that light&#10;only on the box.&#10;&#10;'You may imagine how all my calm vanished. The little brutes were&#10;close upon me. One touched me. I made a sweeping blow in the dark at&#10;them with the levers, and began to scramble into the saddle of the&#10;machine. Then came one hand upon me and then another. Then I had&#10;simply to fight against their persistent fingers for my levers, and&#10;at the same time feel for the studs over which these fitted. One,&#10;indeed, they almost got away from me. As it slipped from my hand,&#10;I had to butt in the dark with my head--I could hear the Morlock's&#10;skull ring--to recover it. It was a nearer thing than the fight in&#10;the forest, I think, this last scramble.&#10;&#10;'But at last the lever was fitted and pulled over. The clinging&#10;hands slipped from me. The darkness presently fell from my eyes.&#10;I found myself in the same grey light and tumult I have already&#10;described.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;XI&#10;&#10;&#10;'I have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comes&#10;with time travelling. And this time I was not seated properly in the&#10;saddle, but sideways and in an unstable fashion. For an indefinite&#10;time I clung to the machine as it swayed and vibrated, quite&#10;unheeding how I went, and when I brought myself to look at the dials&#10;again I was amazed to find where I had arrived. One dial records&#10;days, and another thousands of days, another millions of days, and&#10;another thousands of millions. Now, instead of reversing the levers,&#10;I had pulled them over so as to go forward with them, and when I&#10;came to look at these indicators I found that the thousands hand was&#10;sweeping round as fast as the seconds hand of a watch--into&#10;futurity.&#10;&#10;'As I drove on, a peculiar change crept over the appearance of&#10;things. The palpitating greyness grew darker; then--though I was&#10;still travelling with prodigious velocity--the blinking succession&#10;of day and night, which was usually indicative of a slower pace,&#10;returned, and grew more and more marked. This puzzled me very much&#10;at first. The alternations of night and day grew slower and slower,&#10;and so did the passage of the sun across the sky, until they seemed&#10;to stretch through centuries. At last a steady twilight brooded over&#10;the earth, a twilight only broken now and then when a comet glared&#10;across the darkling sky. The band of light that had indicated the&#10;sun had long since disappeared; for the sun had ceased to set--it&#10;simply rose and fell in the west, and grew ever broader and more&#10;red. All trace of the moon had vanished. The circling of the stars,&#10;growing slower and slower, had given place to creeping points of&#10;light. At last, some time before I stopped, the sun, red and very&#10;large, halted motionless upon the horizon, a vast dome glowing with&#10;a dull heat, and now and then suffering a momentary extinction. At&#10;one time it had for a little while glowed more brilliantly again,&#10;but it speedily reverted to its sullen red heat. I perceived by this&#10;slowing down of its rising and setting that the work of the tidal&#10;drag was done. The earth had come to rest with one face to the sun,&#10;even as in our own time the moon faces the earth. Very cautiously,&#10;for I remembered my former headlong fall, I began to reverse&#10;my motion. Slower and slower went the circling hands until the&#10;thousands one seemed motionless and the daily one was no longer a&#10;mere mist upon its scale. Still slower, until the dim outlines of a&#10;desolate beach grew visible.&#10;&#10;'I stopped very gently and sat upon the Time Machine, looking round.&#10;The sky was no longer blue. North-eastward it was inky black,&#10;and out of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale&#10;white stars. Overhead it was a deep Indian red and starless, and&#10;south-eastward it grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where, cut by&#10;the horizon, lay the huge hull of the sun, red and motionless. The&#10;rocks about me were of a harsh reddish colour, and all the trace of&#10;life that I could see at first was the intensely green vegetation&#10;that covered every projecting point on their south-eastern face. It&#10;was the same rich green that one sees on forest moss or on the&#10;lichen in caves: plants which like these grow in a perpetual&#10;twilight.&#10;&#10;'The machine was standing on a sloping beach. The sea stretched away&#10;to the south-west, to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the&#10;wan sky. There were no breakers and no waves, for not a breath of&#10;wind was stirring. Only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a&#10;gentle breathing, and showed that the eternal sea was still moving&#10;and living. And along the margin where the water sometimes broke was&#10;a thick incrustation of salt--pink under the lurid sky. There was a&#10;sense of oppression in my head, and I noticed that I was breathing&#10;very fast. The sensation reminded me of my only experience of&#10;mountaineering, and from that I judged the air to be more rarefied&#10;than it is now.&#10;&#10;'Far away up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream, and saw a&#10;thing like a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into&#10;the sky and, circling, disappear over some low hillocks beyond. The&#10;sound of its voice was so dismal that I shivered and seated myself&#10;more firmly upon the machine. Looking round me again, I saw that,&#10;quite near, what I had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving&#10;slowly towards me. Then I saw the thing was really a monstrous&#10;crab-like creature. Can you imagine a crab as large as yonder table,&#10;with its many legs moving slowly and uncertainly, its big claws&#10;swaying, its long antennae, like carters' whips, waving and feeling,&#10;and its stalked eyes gleaming at you on either side of its metallic&#10;front? Its back was corrugated and ornamented with ungainly bosses,&#10;and a greenish incrustation blotched it here and there. I could see&#10;the many palps of its complicated mouth flickering and feeling as it&#10;moved.&#10;&#10;'As I stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me, I felt&#10;a tickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there. I tried to&#10;brush it away with my hand, but in a moment it returned, and almost&#10;immediately came another by my ear. I struck at this, and caught&#10;something threadlike. It was drawn swiftly out of my hand. With a&#10;frightful qualm, I turned, and I saw that I had grasped the antenna&#10;of another monster crab that stood just behind me. Its evil eyes&#10;were wriggling on their stalks, its mouth was all alive with&#10;appetite, and its vast ungainly claws, smeared with an algal slime,&#10;were descending upon me. In a moment my hand was on the lever, and&#10;I had placed a month between myself and these monsters. But I was&#10;still on the same beach, and I saw them distinctly now as soon as I&#10;stopped. Dozens of them seemed to be crawling here and there, in the&#10;sombre light, among the foliated sheets of intense green.&#10;&#10;'I cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over&#10;the world. The red eastern sky, the northward blackness, the salt&#10;Dead Sea, the stony beach crawling with these foul, slow-stirring&#10;monsters, the uniform poisonous-looking green of the lichenous&#10;plants, the thin air that hurts one's lungs: all contributed to an&#10;appalling effect. I moved on a hundred years, and there was the same&#10;red sun--a little larger, a little duller--the same dying sea, the&#10;same chill air, and the same crowd of earthy crustacea creeping in&#10;and out among the green weed and the red rocks. And in the westward&#10;sky, I saw a curved pale line like a vast new moon.&#10;&#10;'So I travelled, stopping ever and again, in great strides of a&#10;thousand years or more, drawn on by the mystery of the earth's fate,&#10;watching with a strange fascination the sun grow larger and duller&#10;in the westward sky, and the life of the old earth ebb away. At&#10;last, more than thirty million years hence, the huge red-hot dome of&#10;the sun had come to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling&#10;heavens. Then I stopped once more, for the crawling multitude of&#10;crabs had disappeared, and the red beach, save for its livid green&#10;liverworts and lichens, seemed lifeless. And now it was flecked with&#10;white. A bitter cold assailed me. Rare white flakes ever and again&#10;came eddying down. To the north-eastward, the glare of snow lay&#10;under the starlight of the sable sky and I could see an undulating&#10;crest of hillocks pinkish white. There were fringes of ice along the&#10;sea margin, with drifting masses further out; but the main expanse&#10;of that salt ocean, all bloody under the eternal sunset, was still&#10;unfrozen.&#10;&#10;'I looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained. A&#10;certain indefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of the&#10;machine. But I saw nothing moving, in earth or sky or sea. The green&#10;slime on the rocks alone testified that life was not extinct. A&#10;shallow sandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded&#10;from the beach. I fancied I saw some black object flopping about&#10;upon this bank, but it became motionless as I looked at it, and I&#10;judged that my eye had been deceived, and that the black object was&#10;merely a rock. The stars in the sky were intensely bright and seemed&#10;to me to twinkle very little.&#10;&#10;'Suddenly I noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun&#10;had changed; that a concavity, a bay, had appeared in the curve. I&#10;saw this grow larger. For a minute perhaps I stared aghast at this&#10;blackness that was creeping over the day, and then I realized that&#10;an eclipse was beginning. Either the moon or the planet Mercury was&#10;passing across the sun's disk. Naturally, at first I took it to be&#10;the moon, but there is much to incline me to believe that what I&#10;really saw was the transit of an inner planet passing very near to&#10;the earth.&#10;&#10;'The darkness grew apace; a cold wind began to blow in freshening&#10;gusts from the east, and the showering white flakes in the air&#10;increased in number. From the edge of the sea came a ripple and&#10;whisper. Beyond these lifeless sounds the world was silent. Silent?&#10;It would be hard to convey the stillness of it. All the sounds of&#10;man, the bleating of sheep, the cries of birds, the hum of insects,&#10;the stir that makes the background of our lives--all that was over.&#10;As the darkness thickened, the eddying flakes grew more abundant,&#10;dancing before my eyes; and the cold of the air more intense. At&#10;last, one by one, swiftly, one after the other, the white peaks of&#10;the distant hills vanished into blackness. The breeze rose to a&#10;moaning wind. I saw the black central shadow of the eclipse sweeping&#10;towards me. In another moment the pale stars alone were visible. All&#10;else was rayless obscurity. The sky was absolutely black.&#10;&#10;'A horror of this great darkness came on me. The cold, that smote&#10;to my marrow, and the pain I felt in breathing, overcame me. I&#10;shivered, and a deadly nausea seized me. Then like a red-hot bow&#10;in the sky appeared the edge of the sun. I got off the machine to&#10;recover myself. I felt giddy and incapable of facing the return&#10;journey. As I stood sick and confused I saw again the moving thing&#10;upon the shoal--there was no mistake now that it was a moving&#10;thing--against the red water of the sea. It was a round thing, the&#10;size of a football perhaps, or, it may be, bigger, and tentacles&#10;trailed down from it; it seemed black against the weltering&#10;blood-red water, and it was hopping fitfully about. Then I felt I&#10;was fainting. But a terrible dread of lying helpless in that remote&#10;and awful twilight sustained me while I clambered upon the saddle.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;XII&#10;&#10;&#10;'So I came back. For a long time I must have been insensible upon&#10;the machine. The blinking succession of the days and nights was&#10;resumed, the sun got golden again, the sky blue. I breathed with&#10;greater freedom. The fluctuating contours of the land ebbed and&#10;flowed. The hands spun backward upon the dials. At last I saw again&#10;the dim shadows of houses, the evidences of decadent humanity.&#10;These, too, changed and passed, and others came. Presently, when the&#10;million dial was at zero, I slackened speed. I began to recognize&#10;our own pretty and familiar architecture, the thousands hand ran back&#10;to the starting-point, the night and day flapped slower and slower.&#10;Then the old walls of the laboratory came round me. Very gently,&#10;now, I slowed the mechanism down.&#10;&#10;'I saw one little thing that seemed odd to me. I think I have told&#10;you that when I set out, before my velocity became very high, Mrs.&#10;Watchett had walked across the room, travelling, as it seemed to me,&#10;like a rocket. As I returned, I passed again across that minute when&#10;she traversed the laboratory. But now her every motion appeared to&#10;be the exact inversion of her previous ones. The door at the lower&#10;end opened, and she glided quietly up the laboratory, back foremost,&#10;and disappeared behind the door by which she had previously entered.&#10;Just before that I seemed to see Hillyer for a moment; but he passed&#10;like a flash.&#10;&#10;'Then I stopped the machine, and saw about me again the old familiar&#10;laboratory, my tools, my appliances just as I had left them. I got&#10;off the thing very shakily, and sat down upon my bench. For several&#10;minutes I trembled violently. Then I became calmer. Around me was&#10;my old workshop again, exactly as it had been. I might have slept&#10;there, and the whole thing have been a dream.&#10;&#10;'And yet, not exactly! The thing had started from the south-east&#10;corner of the laboratory. It had come to rest again in the&#10;north-west, against the wall where you saw it. That gives you the&#10;exact distance from my little lawn to the pedestal of the White&#10;Sphinx, into which the Morlocks had carried my machine.&#10;&#10;'For a time my brain went stagnant. Presently I got up and came&#10;through the passage here, limping, because my heel was still&#10;painful, and feeling sorely begrimed. I saw the _Pall Mall Gazette_&#10;on the table by the door. I found the date was indeed to-day, and&#10;looking at the timepiece, saw the hour was almost eight o'clock. I&#10;heard your voices and the clatter of plates. I hesitated--I felt so&#10;sick and weak. Then I sniffed good wholesome meat, and opened the&#10;door on you. You know the rest. I washed, and dined, and now I am&#10;telling you the story.&#10;&#10;'I know,' he said, after a pause, 'that all this will be absolutely&#10;incredible to you. To me the one incredible thing is that I am here&#10;to-night in this old familiar room looking into your friendly faces&#10;and telling you these strange adventures.'&#10;&#10;He looked at the Medical Man. 'No. I cannot expect you to believe&#10;it. Take it as a lie--or a prophecy. Say I dreamed it in the&#10;workshop. Consider I have been speculating upon the destinies of our&#10;race until I have hatched this fiction. Treat my assertion of its&#10;truth as a mere stroke of art to enhance its interest. And taking&#10;it as a story, what do you think of it?'&#10;&#10;He took up his pipe, and began, in his old accustomed manner, to tap&#10;with it nervously upon the bars of the grate. There was a momentary&#10;stillness. Then chairs began to creak and shoes to scrape upon the&#10;carpet. I took my eyes off the Time Traveller's face, and looked&#10;round at his audience. They were in the dark, and little spots of&#10;colour swam before them. The Medical Man seemed absorbed in the&#10;contemplation of our host. The Editor was looking hard at the end&#10;of his cigar--the sixth. The Journalist fumbled for his watch. The&#10;others, as far as I remember, were motionless.&#10;&#10;The Editor stood up with a sigh. 'What a pity it is you're not&#10;a writer of stories!' he said, putting his hand on the Time&#10;Traveller's shoulder.&#10;&#10;'You don't believe it?'&#10;&#10;'Well----'&#10;&#10;'I thought not.'&#10;&#10;The Time Traveller turned to us. 'Where are the matches?' he said.&#10;He lit one and spoke over his pipe, puffing. 'To tell you the truth&#10;... I hardly believe it myself.... And yet...'&#10;&#10;His eye fell with a mute inquiry upon the withered white flowers&#10;upon the little table. Then he turned over the hand holding his&#10;pipe, and I saw he was looking at some half-healed scars on his&#10;knuckles.&#10;&#10;The Medical Man rose, came to the lamp, and examined the flowers.&#10;'The gynaeceum's odd,' he said. The Psychologist leant forward to&#10;see, holding out his hand for a specimen.&#10;&#10;'I'm hanged if it isn't a quarter to one,' said the Journalist.&#10;'How shall we get home?'&#10;&#10;'Plenty of cabs at the station,' said the Psychologist.&#10;&#10;'It's a curious thing,' said the Medical Man; 'but I certainly don't&#10;know the natural order of these flowers. May I have them?'&#10;&#10;The Time Traveller hesitated. Then suddenly: 'Certainly not.'&#10;&#10;'Where did you really get them?' said the Medical Man.&#10;&#10;The Time Traveller put his hand to his head. He spoke like one who&#10;was trying to keep hold of an idea that eluded him. 'They were put&#10;into my pocket by Weena, when I travelled into Time.' He stared&#10;round the room. 'I'm damned if it isn't all going. This room and you&#10;and the atmosphere of every day is too much for my memory. Did I&#10;ever make a Time Machine, or a model of a Time Machine? Or is it all&#10;only a dream? They say life is a dream, a precious poor dream at&#10;times--but I can't stand another that won't fit. It's madness. And&#10;where did the dream come from? ... I must look at that machine. If&#10;there is one!'&#10;&#10;He caught up the lamp swiftly, and carried it, flaring red, through&#10;the door into the corridor. We followed him. There in the flickering&#10;light of the lamp was the machine sure enough, squat, ugly, and&#10;askew; a thing of brass, ebony, ivory, and translucent glimmering&#10;quartz. Solid to the touch--for I put out my hand and felt the rail&#10;of it--and with brown spots and smears upon the ivory, and bits of&#10;grass and moss upon the lower parts, and one rail bent awry.&#10;&#10;The Time Traveller put the lamp down on the bench, and ran his hand&#10;along the damaged rail. 'It's all right now,' he said. 'The story I&#10;told you was true. I'm sorry to have brought you out here in the&#10;cold.' He took up the lamp, and, in an absolute silence, we&#10;returned to the smoking-room.&#10;&#10;He came into the hall with us and helped the Editor on with his&#10;coat. The Medical Man looked into his face and, with a certain&#10;hesitation, told him he was suffering from overwork, at which he&#10;laughed hugely. I remember him standing in the open doorway, bawling&#10;good night.&#10;&#10;I shared a cab with the Editor. He thought the tale a 'gaudy lie.'&#10;For my own part I was unable to come to a conclusion. The story was&#10;so fantastic and incredible, the telling so credible and sober. I&#10;lay awake most of the night thinking about it. I determined to go&#10;next day and see the Time Traveller again. I was told he was in the&#10;laboratory, and being on easy terms in the house, I went up to him.&#10;The laboratory, however, was empty. I stared for a minute at the&#10;Time Machine and put out my hand and touched the lever. At that the&#10;squat substantial-looking mass swayed like a bough shaken by the&#10;wind. Its instability startled me extremely, and I had a queer&#10;reminiscence of the childish days when I used to be forbidden to&#10;meddle. I came back through the corridor. The Time Traveller met me&#10;in the smoking-room. He was coming from the house. He had a small&#10;camera under one arm and a knapsack under the other. He laughed when&#10;he saw me, and gave me an elbow to shake. 'I'm frightfully busy,'&#10;said he, 'with that thing in there.'&#10;&#10;'But is it not some hoax?' I said. 'Do you really travel through&#10;time?'&#10;&#10;'Really and truly I do.' And he looked frankly into my eyes. He&#10;hesitated. His eye wandered about the room. 'I only want half an&#10;hour,' he said. 'I know why you came, and it's awfully good of you.&#10;There's some magazines here. If you'll stop to lunch I'll prove you&#10;this time travelling up to the hilt, specimen and all. If you'll&#10;forgive my leaving you now?'&#10;&#10;I consented, hardly comprehending then the full import of his words,&#10;and he nodded and went on down the corridor. I heard the door of&#10;the laboratory slam, seated myself in a chair, and took up a daily&#10;paper. What was he going to do before lunch-time? Then suddenly&#10;I was reminded by an advertisement that I had promised to meet&#10;Richardson, the publisher, at two. I looked at my watch, and saw&#10;that I could barely save that engagement. I got up and went down the&#10;passage to tell the Time Traveller.&#10;&#10;As I took hold of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation,&#10;oddly truncated at the end, and a click and a thud. A gust of air&#10;whirled round me as I opened the door, and from within came the&#10;sound of broken glass falling on the floor. The Time Traveller was&#10;not there. I seemed to see a ghostly, indistinct figure sitting in&#10;a whirling mass of black and brass for a moment--a figure so&#10;transparent that the bench behind with its sheets of drawings was&#10;absolutely distinct; but this phantasm vanished as I rubbed my eyes.&#10;The Time Machine had gone. Save for a subsiding stir of dust, the&#10;further end of the laboratory was empty. A pane of the skylight had,&#10;apparently, just been blown in.&#10;&#10;I felt an unreasonable amazement. I knew that something strange had&#10;happened, and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange&#10;thing might be. As I stood staring, the door into the garden opened,&#10;and the man-servant appeared.&#10;&#10;We looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. 'Has Mr. ----&#10;gone out that way?' said I.&#10;&#10;'No, sir. No one has come out this way. I was expecting to find him&#10;here.'&#10;&#10;At that I understood. At the risk of disappointing Richardson I&#10;stayed on, waiting for the Time Traveller; waiting for the second,&#10;perhaps still stranger story, and the specimens and photographs he&#10;would bring with him. But I am beginning now to fear that I must&#10;wait a lifetime. The Time Traveller vanished three years ago. And,&#10;as everybody knows now, he has never returned.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;EPILOGUE&#10;&#10;&#10;One cannot choose but wonder. Will he ever return? It may be that he&#10;swept back into the past, and fell among the blood-drinking, hairy&#10;savages of the Age of Unpolished Stone; into the abysses of the&#10;Cretaceous Sea; or among the grotesque saurians, the huge reptilian&#10;brutes of the Jurassic times. He may even now--if I may use the&#10;phrase--be wandering on some plesiosaurus-haunted Oolitic coral&#10;reef, or beside the lonely saline lakes of the Triassic Age. Or did&#10;he go forward, into one of the nearer ages, in which men are still&#10;men, but with the riddles of our own time answered and its wearisome&#10;problems solved? Into the manhood of the race: for I, for my own&#10;part, cannot think that these latter days of weak experiment,&#10;fragmentary theory, and mutual discord are indeed man's culminating&#10;time! I say, for my own part. He, I know--for the question had been&#10;discussed among us long before the Time Machine was made--thought&#10;but cheerlessly of the Advancement of Mankind, and saw in the&#10;growing pile of civilization only a foolish heaping that must&#10;inevitably fall back upon and destroy its makers in the end. If that&#10;is so, it remains for us to live as though it were not so. But to me&#10;the future is still black and blank--is a vast ignorance, lit at a&#10;few casual places by the memory of his story. And I have by me, for&#10;my comfort, two strange white flowers--shrivelled now, and brown and&#10;flat and brittle--to witness that even when mind and strength had&#10;gone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived on in the heart&#10;of man.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;End of Project Gutenberg's The Time Machine, by H.

I was then a child of but five years, yet I well remember the&#10;tall, dark, smooth-faced, athletic man whom I called Uncle Jack.&#10;&#10;He seemed always to be laughing; and he entered into the sports of the&#10;children with the same hearty good fellowship he displayed toward those&#10;pastimes in which the men and women of his own age indulged; or he&#10;would sit for an hour at a time entertaining my old grandmother with&#10;stories of his strange, wild life in all parts of the world.  We all&#10;loved him, and our slaves fairly worshipped the ground he trod.&#10;&#10;He was a splendid specimen of manhood, standing a good two inches over&#10;six feet, broad of shoulder and narrow of hip, with the carriage of the&#10;trained fighting man.  His features were regular and clear cut, his&#10;hair black and closely cropped, while his eyes were of a steel gray,&#10;reflecting a strong and loyal character, filled with fire and&#10;initiative.  His manners were perfect, and his courtliness was that of&#10;a typical southern gentleman of the highest type.&#10;&#10;His horsemanship, especially after hounds, was a marvel and delight&#10;even in that country of magnificent horsemen.  I have often heard my&#10;father caution him against his wild recklessness, but he would only&#10;laugh, and say that the tumble that killed him would be from the back&#10;of a horse yet unfoaled.&#10;&#10;When the war broke out he left us, nor did I see him again for some&#10;fifteen or sixteen years.  When he returned it was without warning, and&#10;I was much surprised to note that he had not aged apparently a moment,&#10;nor had he changed in any other outward way.  He was, when others were&#10;with him, the same genial, happy fellow we had known of old, but when&#10;he thought himself alone I have seen him sit for hours gazing off into&#10;space, his face set in a look of wistful longing and hopeless misery;&#10;and at night he would sit thus looking up into the heavens, at what I&#10;did not know until I read his manuscript years afterward.&#10;&#10;He told us that he had been prospecting and mining in Arizona part of&#10;the time since the war; and that he had been very successful was&#10;evidenced by the unlimited amount of money with which he was supplied.&#10;As to the details of his life during these years he was very reticent,&#10;in fact he would not talk of them at all.&#10;&#10;He remained with us for about a year and then went to New York, where&#10;he purchased a little place on the Hudson, where I visited him once a&#10;year on the occasions of my trips to the New York market--my father and&#10;I owning and operating a string of general stores throughout Virginia&#10;at that time.  Captain Carter had a small but beautiful cottage,&#10;situated on a bluff overlooking the river, and during one of my last&#10;visits, in the winter of 1885, I observed he was much occupied in&#10;writing, I presume now, upon this manuscript.&#10;&#10;He told me at this time that if anything should happen to him he wished&#10;me to take charge of his estate, and he gave me a key to a compartment&#10;in the safe which stood in his study, telling me I would find his will&#10;there and some personal instructions which he had me pledge myself to&#10;carry out with absolute fidelity.&#10;&#10;After I had retired for the night I have seen him from my window&#10;standing in the moonlight on the brink of the bluff overlooking the&#10;Hudson with his arms stretched out to the heavens as though in appeal.&#10;I thought at the time that he was praying, although I never understood&#10;that he was in the strict sense of the term a religious man.&#10;&#10;Several months after I had returned home from my last visit, the first&#10;of March, 1886, I think, I received a telegram from him asking me to&#10;come to him at once.  I had always been his favorite among the younger&#10;generation of Carters and so I hastened to comply with his demand.&#10;&#10;I arrived at the little station, about a mile from his grounds, on the&#10;morning of March 4, 1886, and when I asked the livery man to drive me&#10;out to Captain Carter's he replied that if I was a friend of the&#10;Captain's he had some very bad news for me; the Captain had been found&#10;dead shortly after daylight that very morning by the watchman attached&#10;to an adjoining property.&#10;&#10;For some reason this news did not surprise me, but I hurried out to his&#10;place as quickly as possible, so that I could take charge of the body&#10;and of his affairs.&#10;&#10;I found the watchman who had discovered him, together with the local&#10;police chief and several townspeople, assembled in his little study.&#10;The watchman related the few details connected with the finding of the&#10;body, which he said had been still warm when he came upon it.  It lay,&#10;he said, stretched full length in the snow with the arms outstretched&#10;above the head toward the edge of the bluff, and when he showed me the&#10;spot it flashed upon me that it was the identical one where I had seen&#10;him on those other nights, with his arms raised in supplication to the&#10;skies.&#10;&#10;There were no marks of violence on the body, and with the aid of a&#10;local physician the coroner's jury quickly reached a decision of death&#10;from heart failure.  Left alone in the study, I opened the safe and&#10;withdrew the contents of the drawer in which he had told me I would&#10;find my instructions.  They were in part peculiar indeed, but I have&#10;followed them to each last detail as faithfully as I was able.&#10;&#10;He directed that I remove his body to Virginia without embalming, and&#10;that he be laid in an open coffin within a tomb which he previously had&#10;had constructed and which, as I later learned, was well ventilated.&#10;The instructions impressed upon me that I must personally see that this&#10;was carried out just as he directed, even in secrecy if necessary.&#10;&#10;His property was left in such a way that I was to receive the entire&#10;income for twenty-five years, when the principal was to become mine.&#10;His further instructions related to this manuscript which I was to&#10;retain sealed and unread, just as I found it, for eleven years; nor was&#10;I to divulge its contents until twenty-one years after his death.&#10;&#10;A strange feature about the tomb, where his body still lies, is that&#10;the massive door is equipped with a single, huge gold-plated spring&#10;lock which can be opened _only from the inside_.&#10;&#10;Yours very sincerely,&#10;&#10;Edgar Rice Burroughs.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CONTENTS&#10;&#10;      I  On the Arizona Hills&#10;     II  The Escape of the Dead&#10;    III  My Advent on Mars&#10;     IV  A Prisoner&#10;      V  I Elude My Watch Dog&#10;     VI  A Fight That Won Friends&#10;    VII  Child-Raising on Mars&#10;   VIII  A Fair Captive from the Sky&#10;     IX  I Learn the Language&#10;      X  Champion and Chief&#10;     XI  With Dejah Thoris&#10;    XII  A Prisoner with Power&#10;   XIII  Love-Making on Mars&#10;    XIV  A Duel to the Death&#10;     XV  Sola Tells Me Her Story&#10;    XVI  We Plan Escape&#10;   XVII  A Costly Recapture&#10;  XVIII  Chained in Warhoon&#10;    XIX  Battling in the Arena&#10;     XX  In the Atmosphere Factory&#10;    XXI  An Air Scout for Zodanga&#10;   XXII  I Find Dejah&#10;  XXIII  Lost in the Sky&#10;   XXIV  Tars Tarkas Finds a Friend&#10;    XXV  The Looting of Zodanga&#10;   XXVI  Through Carnage to Joy&#10;  XXVII  From Joy to Death&#10; XXVIII  At the Arizona Cave&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;ILLUSTRATIONS&#10;&#10;&#10;With my back against a golden throne,&#10;  I fought once again for Dejah Thoris . . . . . . _Frontispiece_&#10;&#10;I sought out Dejah Thoris in the throng of departing chariots.&#10;&#10;She drew upon the marble floor the first map of the&#10;  Barsoomian territory I had ever seen.&#10;&#10;The old man sat and talked with me for hours.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER I&#10;&#10;ON THE ARIZONA HILLS&#10;&#10;&#10;I am a very old man; how old I do not know.  Possibly I am a hundred,&#10;possibly more; but I cannot tell because I have never aged as other&#10;men, nor do I remember any childhood.  So far as I can recollect I have&#10;always been a man, a man of about thirty.  I appear today as I did&#10;forty years and more ago, and yet I feel that I cannot go on living&#10;forever; that some day I shall die the real death from which there is&#10;no resurrection.  I do not know why I should fear death, I who have&#10;died twice and am still alive; but yet I have the same horror of it as&#10;you who have never died, and it is because of this terror of death, I&#10;believe, that I am so convinced of my mortality.&#10;&#10;And because of this conviction I have determined to write down the&#10;story of the interesting periods of my life and of my death.  I cannot&#10;explain the phenomena; I can only set down here in the words of an&#10;ordinary soldier of fortune a chronicle of the strange events that&#10;befell me during the ten years that my dead body lay undiscovered in an&#10;Arizona cave.&#10;&#10;I have never told this story, nor shall mortal man see this manuscript&#10;until after I have passed over for eternity.  I know that the average&#10;human mind will not believe what it cannot grasp, and so I do not&#10;purpose being pilloried by the public, the pulpit, and the press, and&#10;held up as a colossal liar when I am but telling the simple truths&#10;which some day science will substantiate.  Possibly the suggestions&#10;which I gained upon Mars, and the knowledge which I can set down in&#10;this chronicle, will aid in an earlier understanding of the mysteries&#10;of our sister planet; mysteries to you, but no longer mysteries to me.&#10;&#10;My name is John Carter; I am better known as Captain Jack Carter of&#10;Virginia.  At the close of the Civil War I found myself possessed of&#10;several hundred thousand dollars (Confederate) and a captain's&#10;commission in the cavalry arm of an army which no longer existed; the&#10;servant of a state which had vanished with the hopes of the South.&#10;Masterless, penniless, and with my only means of livelihood, fighting,&#10;gone, I determined to work my way to the southwest and attempt to&#10;retrieve my fallen fortunes in a search for gold.&#10;&#10;I spent nearly a year prospecting in company with another Confederate&#10;officer, Captain James K. Powell of Richmond.  We were extremely&#10;fortunate, for late in the winter of 1865, after many hardships and&#10;privations, we located the most remarkable gold-bearing quartz vein&#10;that our wildest dreams had ever pictured.  Powell, who was a mining&#10;engineer by education, stated that we had uncovered over a million&#10;dollars worth of ore in a trifle over three months.&#10;&#10;As our equipment was crude in the extreme we decided that one of us&#10;must return to civilization, purchase the necessary machinery and&#10;return with a sufficient force of men properly to work the mine.&#10;&#10;As Powell was familiar with the country, as well as with the mechanical&#10;requirements of mining we determined that it would be best for him to&#10;make the trip.  It was agreed that I was to hold down our claim against&#10;the remote possibility of its being jumped by some wandering prospector.&#10;&#10;On March 3, 1866, Powell and I packed his provisions on two of our&#10;burros, and bidding me good-bye he mounted his horse, and started down&#10;the mountainside toward the valley, across which led the first stage of&#10;his journey.&#10;&#10;The morning of Powell's departure was, like nearly all Arizona&#10;mornings, clear and beautiful; I could see him and his little pack&#10;animals picking their way down the mountainside toward the valley, and&#10;all during the morning I would catch occasional glimpses of them as&#10;they topped a hog back or came out upon a level plateau.  My last sight&#10;of Powell was about three in the afternoon as he entered the shadows of&#10;the range on the opposite side of the valley.&#10;&#10;Some half hour later I happened to glance casually across the valley&#10;and was much surprised to note three little dots in about the same&#10;place I had last seen my friend and his two pack animals.  I am not&#10;given to needless worrying, but the more I tried to convince myself&#10;that all was well with Powell, and that the dots I had seen on his&#10;trail were antelope or wild horses, the less I was able to assure&#10;myself.&#10;&#10;Since we had entered the territory we had not seen a hostile Indian,&#10;and we had, therefore, become careless in the extreme, and were wont to&#10;ridicule the stories we had heard of the great numbers of these vicious&#10;marauders that were supposed to haunt the trails, taking their toll in&#10;lives and torture of every white party which fell into their merciless&#10;clutches.&#10;&#10;Powell, I knew, was well armed and, further, an experienced Indian&#10;fighter; but I too had lived and fought for years among the Sioux in&#10;the North, and I knew that his chances were small against a party of&#10;cunning trailing Apaches.  Finally I could endure the suspense no&#10;longer, and, arming myself with my two Colt revolvers and a carbine, I&#10;strapped two belts of cartridges about me and catching my saddle horse,&#10;started down the trail taken by Powell in the morning.&#10;&#10;As soon as I reached comparatively level ground I urged my mount into a&#10;canter and continued this, where the going permitted, until, close upon&#10;dusk, I discovered the point where other tracks joined those of Powell.&#10;They were the tracks of unshod ponies, three of them, and the ponies&#10;had been galloping.&#10;&#10;I followed rapidly until, darkness shutting down, I was forced to await&#10;the rising of the moon, and given an opportunity to speculate on the&#10;question of the wisdom of my chase.  Possibly I had conjured up&#10;impossible dangers, like some nervous old housewife, and when I should&#10;catch up with Powell would get a good laugh for my pains.  However, I&#10;am not prone to sensitiveness, and the following of a sense of duty,&#10;wherever it may lead, has always been a kind of fetich with me&#10;throughout my life; which may account for the honors bestowed upon me&#10;by three republics and the decorations and friendships of an old and&#10;powerful emperor and several lesser kings, in whose service my sword&#10;has been red many a time.&#10;&#10;About nine o'clock the moon was sufficiently bright for me to proceed&#10;on my way and I had no difficulty in following the trail at a fast&#10;walk, and in some places at a brisk trot until, about midnight, I&#10;reached the water hole where Powell had expected to camp.  I came upon&#10;the spot unexpectedly, finding it entirely deserted, with no signs of&#10;having been recently occupied as a camp.&#10;&#10;I was interested to note that the tracks of the pursuing horsemen, for&#10;such I was now convinced they must be, continued after Powell with only&#10;a brief stop at the hole for water; and always at the same rate of&#10;speed as his.&#10;&#10;I was positive now that the trailers were Apaches and that they wished&#10;to capture Powell alive for the fiendish pleasure of the torture, so I&#10;urged my horse onward at a most dangerous pace, hoping against hope&#10;that I would catch up with the red rascals before they attacked him.&#10;&#10;Further speculation was suddenly cut short by the faint report of two&#10;shots far ahead of me.  I knew that Powell would need me now if ever,&#10;and I instantly urged my horse to his topmost speed up the narrow and&#10;difficult mountain trail.&#10;&#10;I had forged ahead for perhaps a mile or more without hearing further&#10;sounds, when the trail suddenly debouched onto a small, open plateau&#10;near the summit of the pass.  I had passed through a narrow,&#10;overhanging gorge just before entering suddenly upon this table land,&#10;and the sight which met my eyes filled me with consternation and dismay.&#10;&#10;The little stretch of level land was white with Indian tepees, and&#10;there were probably half a thousand red warriors clustered around some&#10;object near the center of the camp.  Their attention was so wholly&#10;riveted to this point of interest that they did not notice me, and I&#10;easily could have turned back into the dark recesses of the gorge and&#10;made my escape with perfect safety.  The fact, however, that this&#10;thought did not occur to me until the following day removes any&#10;possible right to a claim to heroism to which the narration of this&#10;episode might possibly otherwise entitle me.&#10;&#10;I do not believe that I am made of the stuff which constitutes heroes,&#10;because, in all of the hundreds of instances that my voluntary acts&#10;have placed me face to face with death, I cannot recall a single one&#10;where any alternative step to that I took occurred to me until many&#10;hours later.  My mind is evidently so constituted that I am&#10;subconsciously forced into the path of duty without recourse to&#10;tiresome mental processes.  However that may be, I have never regretted&#10;that cowardice is not optional with me.&#10;&#10;In this instance I was, of course, positive that Powell was the center&#10;of attraction, but whether I thought or acted first I do not know, but&#10;within an instant from the moment the scene broke upon my view I had&#10;whipped out my revolvers and was charging down upon the entire army of&#10;warriors, shooting rapidly, and whooping at the top of my lungs.&#10;Singlehanded, I could not have pursued better tactics, for the red men,&#10;convinced by sudden surprise that not less than a regiment of regulars&#10;was upon them, turned and fled in every direction for their bows,&#10;arrows, and rifles.&#10;&#10;The view which their hurried routing disclosed filled me with&#10;apprehension and with rage.  Under the clear rays of the Arizona moon&#10;lay Powell, his body fairly bristling with the hostile arrows of the&#10;braves.  That he was already dead I could not but be convinced, and yet&#10;I would have saved his body from mutilation at the hands of the Apaches&#10;as quickly as I would have saved the man himself from death.&#10;&#10;Riding close to him I reached down from the saddle, and grasping his&#10;cartridge belt drew him up across the withers of my mount.  A backward&#10;glance convinced me that to return by the way I had come would be more&#10;hazardous than to continue across the plateau, so, putting spurs to my&#10;poor beast, I made a dash for the opening to the pass which I could&#10;distinguish on the far side of the table land.&#10;&#10;The Indians had by this time discovered that I was alone and I was&#10;pursued with imprecations, arrows, and rifle balls.  The fact that it&#10;is difficult to aim anything but imprecations accurately by moonlight,&#10;that they were upset by the sudden and unexpected manner of my advent,&#10;and that I was a rather rapidly moving target saved me from the various&#10;deadly projectiles of the enemy and permitted me to reach the shadows&#10;of the surrounding peaks before an orderly pursuit could be organized.&#10;&#10;My horse was traveling practically unguided as I knew that I had&#10;probably less knowledge of the exact location of the trail to the pass&#10;than he, and thus it happened that he entered a defile which led to the&#10;summit of the range and not to the pass which I had hoped would carry&#10;me to the valley and to safety.  It is probable, however, that to this&#10;fact I owe my life and the remarkable experiences and adventures which&#10;befell me during the following ten years.&#10;&#10;My first knowledge that I was on the wrong trail came when I heard the&#10;yells of the pursuing savages suddenly grow fainter and fainter far off&#10;to my left.&#10;&#10;I knew then that they had passed to the left of the jagged rock&#10;formation at the edge of the plateau, to the right of which my horse&#10;had borne me and the body of Powell.&#10;&#10;I drew rein on a little level promontory overlooking the trail below&#10;and to my left, and saw the party of pursuing savages disappearing&#10;around the point of a neighboring peak.&#10;&#10;I knew the Indians would soon discover that they were on the wrong&#10;trail and that the search for me would be renewed in the right&#10;direction as soon as they located my tracks.&#10;&#10;I had gone but a short distance further when what seemed to be an&#10;excellent trail opened up around the face of a high cliff.  The trail&#10;was level and quite broad and led upward and in the general direction I&#10;wished to go.  The cliff arose for several hundred feet on my right,&#10;and on my left was an equal and nearly perpendicular drop to the bottom&#10;of a rocky ravine.&#10;&#10;I had followed this trail for perhaps a hundred yards when a sharp turn&#10;to the right brought me to the mouth of a large cave.  The opening was&#10;about four feet in height and three to four feet wide, and at this&#10;opening the trail ended.&#10;&#10;It was now morning, and, with the customary lack of dawn which is a&#10;startling characteristic of Arizona, it had become daylight almost&#10;without warning.&#10;&#10;Dismounting, I laid Powell upon the ground, but the most painstaking&#10;examination failed to reveal the faintest spark of life.  I forced&#10;water from my canteen between his dead lips, bathed his face and rubbed&#10;his hands, working over him continuously for the better part of an hour&#10;in the face of the fact that I knew him to be dead.&#10;&#10;I was very fond of Powell; he was thoroughly a man in every respect; a&#10;polished southern gentleman; a staunch and true friend; and it was with&#10;a feeling of the deepest grief that I finally gave up my crude&#10;endeavors at resuscitation.&#10;&#10;Leaving Powell's body where it lay on the ledge I crept into the cave&#10;to reconnoiter.  I found a large chamber, possibly a hundred feet in&#10;diameter and thirty or forty feet in height; a smooth and well-worn&#10;floor, and many other evidences that the cave had, at some remote&#10;period, been inhabited.  The back of the cave was so lost in dense&#10;shadow that I could not distinguish whether there were openings into&#10;other apartments or not.&#10;&#10;As I was continuing my examination I commenced to feel a pleasant&#10;drowsiness creeping over me which I attributed to the fatigue of my&#10;long and strenuous ride, and the reaction from the excitement of the&#10;fight and the pursuit.  I felt comparatively safe in my present&#10;location as I knew that one man could defend the trail to the cave&#10;against an army.&#10;&#10;I soon became so drowsy that I could scarcely resist the strong desire&#10;to throw myself on the floor of the cave for a few moments' rest, but I&#10;knew that this would never do, as it would mean certain death at the&#10;hands of my red friends, who might be upon me at any moment.  With an&#10;effort I started toward the opening of the cave only to reel drunkenly&#10;against a side wall, and from there slip prone upon the floor.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER II&#10;&#10;THE ESCAPE OF THE DEAD&#10;&#10;&#10;A sense of delicious dreaminess overcame me, my muscles relaxed, and I&#10;was on the point of giving way to my desire to sleep when the sound of&#10;approaching horses reached my ears.  I attempted to spring to my feet&#10;but was horrified to discover that my muscles refused to respond to my&#10;will.  I was now thoroughly awake, but as unable to move a muscle as&#10;though turned to stone.  It was then, for the first time, that I&#10;noticed a slight vapor filling the cave.  It was extremely tenuous and&#10;only noticeable against the opening which led to daylight.  There also&#10;came to my nostrils a faintly pungent odor, and I could only assume&#10;that I had been overcome by some poisonous gas, but why I should retain&#10;my mental faculties and yet be unable to move I could not fathom.&#10;&#10;I lay facing the opening of the cave and where I could see the short&#10;stretch of trail which lay between the cave and the turn of the cliff&#10;around which the trail led.  The noise of the approaching horses had&#10;ceased, and I judged the Indians were creeping stealthily upon me along&#10;the little ledge which led to my living tomb.  I remember that I hoped&#10;they would make short work of me as I did not particularly relish the&#10;thought of the innumerable things they might do to me if the spirit&#10;prompted them.&#10;&#10;I had not long to wait before a stealthy sound apprised me of their&#10;nearness, and then a war-bonneted, paint-streaked face was thrust&#10;cautiously around the shoulder of the cliff, and savage eyes looked&#10;into mine.  That he could see me in the dim light of the cave I was&#10;sure for the early morning sun was falling full upon me through the&#10;opening.&#10;&#10;The fellow, instead of approaching, merely stood and stared; his eyes&#10;bulging and his jaw dropped.  And then another savage face appeared,&#10;and a third and fourth and fifth, craning their necks over the&#10;shoulders of their fellows whom they could not pass upon the narrow&#10;ledge.  Each face was the picture of awe and fear, but for what reason&#10;I did not know, nor did I learn until ten years later.  That there were&#10;still other braves behind those who regarded me was apparent from the&#10;fact that the leaders passed back whispered word to those behind them.&#10;&#10;Suddenly a low but distinct moaning sound issued from the recesses of&#10;the cave behind me, and, as it reached the ears of the Indians, they&#10;turned and fled in terror, panic-stricken.  So frantic were their&#10;efforts to escape from the unseen thing behind me that one of the&#10;braves was hurled headlong from the cliff to the rocks below.  Their&#10;wild cries echoed in the canyon for a short time, and then all was&#10;still once more.&#10;&#10;The sound which had frightened them was not repeated, but it had been&#10;sufficient as it was to start me speculating on the possible horror&#10;which lurked in the shadows at my back.  Fear is a relative term and so&#10;I can only measure my feelings at that time by what I had experienced&#10;in previous positions of danger and by those that I have passed through&#10;since; but I can say without shame that if the sensations I endured&#10;during the next few minutes were fear, then may God help the coward,&#10;for cowardice is of a surety its own punishment.&#10;&#10;To be held paralyzed, with one's back toward some horrible and unknown&#10;danger from the very sound of which the ferocious Apache warriors turn&#10;in wild stampede, as a flock of sheep would madly flee from a pack of&#10;wolves, seems to me the last word in fearsome predicaments for a man&#10;who had ever been used to fighting for his life with all the energy of&#10;a powerful physique.&#10;&#10;Several times I thought I heard faint sounds behind me as of somebody&#10;moving cautiously, but eventually even these ceased, and I was left to&#10;the contemplation of my position without interruption.  I could but&#10;vaguely conjecture the cause of my paralysis, and my only hope lay in&#10;that it might pass off as suddenly as it had fallen upon me.&#10;&#10;Late in the afternoon my horse, which had been standing with dragging&#10;rein before the cave, started slowly down the trail, evidently in&#10;search of food and water, and I was left alone with my mysterious&#10;unknown companion and the dead body of my friend, which lay just within&#10;my range of vision upon the ledge where I had placed it in the early&#10;morning.&#10;&#10;From then until possibly midnight all was silence, the silence of the&#10;dead; then, suddenly, the awful moan of the morning broke upon my&#10;startled ears, and there came again from the black shadows the sound of&#10;a moving thing, and a faint rustling as of dead leaves.  The shock to&#10;my already overstrained nervous system was terrible in the extreme, and&#10;with a superhuman effort I strove to break my awful bonds.  It was an&#10;effort of the mind, of the will, of the nerves; not muscular, for I&#10;could not move even so much as my little finger, but none the less&#10;mighty for all that.  And then something gave, there was a momentary&#10;feeling of nausea, a sharp click as of the snapping of a steel wire,&#10;and I stood with my back against the wall of the cave facing my unknown&#10;foe.&#10;&#10;And then the moonlight flooded the cave, and there before me lay my own&#10;body as it had been lying all these hours, with the eyes staring toward&#10;the open ledge and the hands resting limply upon the ground.  I looked&#10;first at my lifeless clay there upon the floor of the cave and then&#10;down at myself in utter bewilderment; for there I lay clothed, and yet&#10;here I stood but naked as at the minute of my birth.&#10;&#10;The transition had been so sudden and so unexpected that it left me for&#10;a moment forgetful of aught else than my strange metamorphosis.  My&#10;first thought was, is this then death!  Have I indeed passed over&#10;forever into that other life!  But I could not well believe this, as I&#10;could feel my heart pounding against my ribs from the exertion of my&#10;efforts to release myself from the anaesthesis which had held me.  My&#10;breath was coming in quick, short gasps, cold sweat stood out from&#10;every pore of my body, and the ancient experiment of pinching revealed&#10;the fact that I was anything other than a wraith.&#10;&#10;Again was I suddenly recalled to my immediate surroundings by a&#10;repetition of the weird moan from the depths of the cave.  Naked and&#10;unarmed as I was, I had no desire to face the unseen thing which&#10;menaced me.&#10;&#10;My revolvers were strapped to my lifeless body which, for some&#10;unfathomable reason, I could not bring myself to touch.  My carbine was&#10;in its boot, strapped to my saddle, and as my horse had wandered off I&#10;was left without means of defense.  My only alternative seemed to lie&#10;in flight and my decision was crystallized by a recurrence of the&#10;rustling sound from the thing which now seemed, in the darkness of the&#10;cave and to my distorted imagination, to be creeping stealthily upon me.&#10;&#10;Unable longer to resist the temptation to escape this horrible place I&#10;leaped quickly through the opening into the starlight of a clear&#10;Arizona night.  The crisp, fresh mountain air outside the cave acted as&#10;an immediate tonic and I felt new life and new courage coursing through&#10;me.  Pausing upon the brink of the ledge I upbraided myself for what&#10;now seemed to me wholly unwarranted apprehension.  I reasoned with&#10;myself that I had lain helpless for many hours within the cave, yet&#10;nothing had molested me, and my better judgment, when permitted the&#10;direction of clear and logical reasoning, convinced me that the noises&#10;I had heard must have resulted from purely natural and harmless causes;&#10;probably the conformation of the cave was such that a slight breeze had&#10;caused the sounds I heard.&#10;&#10;I decided to investigate, but first I lifted my head to fill my lungs&#10;with the pure, invigorating night air of the mountains.  As I did so I&#10;saw stretching far below me the beautiful vista of rocky gorge, and&#10;level, cacti-studded flat, wrought by the moonlight into a miracle of&#10;soft splendor and wondrous enchantment.&#10;&#10;Few western wonders are more inspiring than the beauties of an Arizona&#10;moonlit landscape; the silvered mountains in the distance, the strange&#10;lights and shadows upon hog back and arroyo, and the grotesque details&#10;of the stiff, yet beautiful cacti form a picture at once enchanting and&#10;inspiring; as though one were catching for the first time a glimpse of&#10;some dead and forgotten world, so different is it from the aspect of&#10;any other spot upon our earth.&#10;&#10;As I stood thus meditating, I turned my gaze from the landscape to the&#10;heavens where the myriad stars formed a gorgeous and fitting canopy for&#10;the wonders of the earthly scene.  My attention was quickly riveted by&#10;a large red star close to the distant horizon.  As I gazed upon it I&#10;felt a spell of overpowering fascination--it was Mars, the god of war,&#10;and for me, the fighting man, it had always held the power of&#10;irresistible enchantment.  As I gazed at it on that far-gone night it&#10;seemed to call across the unthinkable void, to lure me to it, to draw&#10;me as the lodestone attracts a particle of iron.&#10;&#10;My longing was beyond the power of opposition; I closed my eyes,&#10;stretched out my arms toward the god of my vocation and felt myself&#10;drawn with the suddenness of thought through the trackless immensity of&#10;space.  There was an instant of extreme cold and utter darkness.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER III&#10;&#10;MY ADVENT ON MARS&#10;&#10;&#10;I opened my eyes upon a strange and weird landscape.  I knew that I was&#10;on Mars; not once did I question either my sanity or my wakefulness.  I&#10;was not asleep, no need for pinching here; my inner consciousness told&#10;me as plainly that I was upon Mars as your conscious mind tells you&#10;that you are upon Earth.  You do not question the fact; neither did I.&#10;&#10;I found myself lying prone upon a bed of yellowish, mosslike vegetation&#10;which stretched around me in all directions for interminable miles.  I&#10;seemed to be lying in a deep, circular basin, along the outer verge of&#10;which I could distinguish the irregularities of low hills.&#10;&#10;It was midday, the sun was shining full upon me and the heat of it was&#10;rather intense upon my naked body, yet no greater than would have been&#10;true under similar conditions on an Arizona desert.  Here and there&#10;were slight outcroppings of quartz-bearing rock which glistened in the&#10;sunlight; and a little to my left, perhaps a hundred yards, appeared a&#10;low, walled enclosure about four feet in height.  No water, and no&#10;other vegetation than the moss was in evidence, and as I was somewhat&#10;thirsty I determined to do a little exploring.&#10;&#10;Springing to my feet I received my first Martian surprise, for the&#10;effort, which on Earth would have brought me standing upright, carried&#10;me into the Martian air to the height of about three yards.  I alighted&#10;softly upon the ground, however, without appreciable shock or jar.  Now&#10;commenced a series of evolutions which even then seemed ludicrous in&#10;the extreme.  I found that I must learn to walk all over again, as the&#10;muscular exertion which carried me easily and safely upon Earth played&#10;strange antics with me upon Mars.&#10;&#10;Instead of progressing in a sane and dignified manner, my attempts to&#10;walk resulted in a variety of hops which took me clear of the ground a&#10;couple of feet at each step and landed me sprawling upon my face or&#10;back at the end of each second or third hop.  My muscles, perfectly&#10;attuned and accustomed to the force of gravity on Earth, played the&#10;mischief with me in attempting for the first time to cope with the&#10;lesser gravitation and lower air pressure on Mars.&#10;&#10;I was determined, however, to explore the low structure which was the&#10;only evidence of habitation in sight, and so I hit upon the unique plan&#10;of reverting to first principles in locomotion, creeping.  I did fairly&#10;well at this and in a few moments had reached the low, encircling wall&#10;of the enclosure.&#10;&#10;There appeared to be no doors or windows upon the side nearest me, but&#10;as the wall was but about four feet high I cautiously gained my feet&#10;and peered over the top upon the strangest sight it had ever been given&#10;me to see.&#10;&#10;The roof of the enclosure was of solid glass about four or five inches&#10;in thickness, and beneath this were several hundred large eggs,&#10;perfectly round and snowy white.  The eggs were nearly uniform in size&#10;being about two and one-half feet in diameter.&#10;&#10;Five or six had already hatched and the grotesque caricatures which sat&#10;blinking in the sunlight were enough to cause me to doubt my sanity.&#10;They seemed mostly head, with little scrawny bodies, long necks and six&#10;legs, or, as I afterward learned, two legs and two arms, with an&#10;intermediary pair of limbs which could be used at will either as arms&#10;or legs.  Their eyes were set at the extreme sides of their heads a&#10;trifle above the center and protruded in such a manner that they could&#10;be directed either forward or back and also independently of each&#10;other, thus permitting this queer animal to look in any direction, or&#10;in two directions at once, without the necessity of turning the head.&#10;&#10;The ears, which were slightly above the eyes and closer together, were&#10;small, cup-shaped antennae, protruding not more than an inch on these&#10;young specimens.  Their noses were but longitudinal slits in the center&#10;of their faces, midway between their mouths and ears.&#10;&#10;There was no hair on their bodies, which were of a very light&#10;yellowish-green color.  In the adults, as I was to learn quite soon,&#10;this color deepens to an olive green and is darker in the male than in&#10;the female.  Further, the heads of the adults are not so out of&#10;proportion to their bodies as in the case of the young.&#10;&#10;The iris of the eyes is blood red, as in Albinos, while the pupil is&#10;dark.  The eyeball itself is very white, as are the teeth.  These&#10;latter add a most ferocious appearance to an otherwise fearsome and&#10;terrible countenance, as the lower tusks curve upward to sharp points&#10;which end about where the eyes of earthly human beings are located.&#10;The whiteness of the teeth is not that of ivory, but of the snowiest&#10;and most gleaming of china.  Against the dark background of their olive&#10;skins their tusks stand out in a most striking manner, making these&#10;weapons present a singularly formidable appearance.&#10;&#10;Most of these details I noted later, for I was given but little time to&#10;speculate on the wonders of my new discovery.  I had seen that the eggs&#10;were in the process of hatching, and as I stood watching the hideous&#10;little monsters break from their shells I failed to note the approach&#10;of a score of full-grown Martians from behind me.&#10;&#10;Coming, as they did, over the soft and soundless moss, which covers&#10;practically the entire surface of Mars with the exception of the frozen&#10;areas at the poles and the scattered cultivated districts, they might&#10;have captured me easily, but their intentions were far more sinister.&#10;It was the rattling of the accouterments of the foremost warrior which&#10;warned me.&#10;&#10;On such a little thing my life hung that I often marvel that I escaped&#10;so easily.  Had not the rifle of the leader of the party swung from its&#10;fastenings beside his saddle in such a way as to strike against the&#10;butt of his great metal-shod spear I should have snuffed out without&#10;ever knowing that death was near me.  But the little sound caused me to&#10;turn, and there upon me, not ten feet from my breast, was the point of&#10;that huge spear, a spear forty feet long, tipped with gleaming metal,&#10;and held low at the side of a mounted replica of the little devils I&#10;had been watching.&#10;&#10;But how puny and harmless they now looked beside this huge and terrific&#10;incarnation of hate, of vengeance and of death.  The man himself, for&#10;such I may call him, was fully fifteen feet in height and, on Earth,&#10;would have weighed some four hundred pounds.  He sat his mount as we&#10;sit a horse, grasping the animal's barrel with his lower limbs, while&#10;the hands of his two right arms held his immense spear low at the side&#10;of his mount; his two left arms were outstretched laterally to help&#10;preserve his balance, the thing he rode having neither bridle or reins&#10;of any description for guidance.&#10;&#10;And his mount!  How can earthly words describe it!  It towered ten feet&#10;at the shoulder; had four legs on either side; a broad flat tail,&#10;larger at the tip than at the root, and which it held straight out&#10;behind while running; a gaping mouth which split its head from its&#10;snout to its long, massive neck.&#10;&#10;Like its master, it was entirely devoid of hair, but was of a dark&#10;slate color and exceeding smooth and glossy.  Its belly was white, and&#10;its legs shaded from the slate of its shoulders and hips to a vivid&#10;yellow at the feet.  The feet themselves were heavily padded and&#10;nailless, which fact had also contributed to the noiselessness of their&#10;approach, and, in common with a multiplicity of legs, is a&#10;characteristic feature of the fauna of Mars.  The highest type of man&#10;and one other animal, the only mammal existing on Mars, alone have&#10;well-formed nails, and there are absolutely no hoofed animals in&#10;existence there.&#10;&#10;Behind this first charging demon trailed nineteen others, similar in&#10;all respects, but, as I learned later, bearing individual&#10;characteristics peculiar to themselves; precisely as no two of us are&#10;identical although we are all cast in a similar mold.  This picture, or&#10;rather materialized nightmare, which I have described at length, made&#10;but one terrible and swift impression on me as I turned to meet it.&#10;&#10;Unarmed and naked as I was, the first law of nature manifested itself&#10;in the only possible solution of my immediate problem, and that was to&#10;get out of the vicinity of the point of the charging spear.&#10;Consequently I gave a very earthly and at the same time superhuman leap&#10;to reach the top of the Martian incubator, for such I had determined it&#10;must be.&#10;&#10;My effort was crowned with a success which appalled me no less than it&#10;seemed to surprise the Martian warriors, for it carried me fully thirty&#10;feet into the air and landed me a hundred feet from my pursuers and on&#10;the opposite side of the enclosure.&#10;&#10;I alighted upon the soft moss easily and without mishap, and turning&#10;saw my enemies lined up along the further wall.  Some were surveying me&#10;with expressions which I afterward discovered marked extreme&#10;astonishment, and the others were evidently satisfying themselves that&#10;I had not molested their young.&#10;&#10;They were conversing together in low tones, and gesticulating and&#10;pointing toward me.  Their discovery that I had not harmed the little&#10;Martians, and that I was unarmed, must have caused them to look upon me&#10;with less ferocity; but, as I was to learn later, the thing which&#10;weighed most in my favor was my exhibition of hurdling.&#10;&#10;While the Martians are immense, their bones are very large and they are&#10;muscled only in proportion to the gravitation which they must overcome.&#10;The result is that they are infinitely less agile and less powerful, in&#10;proportion to their weight, than an Earth man, and I doubt that were&#10;one of them suddenly to be transported to Earth he could lift his own&#10;weight from the ground; in fact, I am convinced that he could not do so.&#10;&#10;My feat then was as marvelous upon Mars as it would have been upon&#10;Earth, and from desiring to annihilate me they suddenly looked upon me&#10;as a wonderful discovery to be captured and exhibited among their&#10;fellows.&#10;&#10;The respite my unexpected agility had given me permitted me to&#10;formulate plans for the immediate future and to note more closely the&#10;appearance of the warriors, for I could not disassociate these people&#10;in my mind from those other warriors who, only the day before, had been&#10;pursuing me.&#10;&#10;I noted that each was armed with several other weapons in addition to&#10;the huge spear which I have described.  The weapon which caused me to&#10;decide against an attempt at escape by flight was what was evidently a&#10;rifle of some description, and which I felt, for some reason, they were&#10;peculiarly efficient in handling.&#10;&#10;These rifles were of a white metal stocked with wood, which I learned&#10;later was a very light and intensely hard growth much prized on Mars,&#10;and entirely unknown to us denizens of Earth.  The metal of the barrel&#10;is an alloy composed principally of aluminum and steel which they have&#10;learned to temper to a hardness far exceeding that of the steel with&#10;which we are familiar.  The weight of these rifles is comparatively&#10;little, and with the small caliber, explosive, radium projectiles which&#10;they use, and the great length of the barrel, they are deadly in the&#10;extreme and at ranges which would be unthinkable on Earth.  The&#10;theoretic effective radius of this rifle is three hundred miles, but&#10;the best they can do in actual service when equipped with their&#10;wireless finders and sighters is but a trifle over two hundred miles.&#10;&#10;This is quite far enough to imbue me with great respect for the Martian&#10;firearm, and some telepathic force must have warned me against an&#10;attempt to escape in broad daylight from under the muzzles of twenty of&#10;these death-dealing machines.&#10;&#10;The Martians, after conversing for a short time, turned and rode away&#10;in the direction from which they had come, leaving one of their number&#10;alone by the enclosure.  When they had covered perhaps two hundred&#10;yards they halted, and turning their mounts toward us sat watching the&#10;warrior by the enclosure.&#10;&#10;He was the one whose spear had so nearly transfixed me, and was&#10;evidently the leader of the band, as I had noted that they seemed to&#10;have moved to their present position at his direction.  When his force&#10;had come to a halt he dismounted, threw down his spear and small arms,&#10;and came around the end of the incubator toward me, entirely unarmed&#10;and as naked as I, except for the ornaments strapped upon his head,&#10;limbs, and breast.&#10;&#10;When he was within about fifty feet of me he unclasped an enormous&#10;metal armlet, and holding it toward me in the open palm of his hand,&#10;addressed me in a clear, resonant voice, but in a language, it is&#10;needless to say, I could not understand.  He then stopped as though&#10;waiting for my reply, pricking up his antennae-like ears and cocking&#10;his strange-looking eyes still further toward me.&#10;&#10;As the silence became painful I concluded to hazard a little&#10;conversation on my own part, as I had guessed that he was making&#10;overtures of peace.  The throwing down of his weapons and the&#10;withdrawing of his troop before his advance toward me would have&#10;signified a peaceful mission anywhere on Earth, so why not, then, on&#10;Mars!&#10;&#10;Placing my hand over my heart I bowed low to the Martian and explained&#10;to him that while I did not understand his language, his actions spoke&#10;for the peace and friendship that at the present moment were most dear&#10;to my heart.  Of course I might have been a babbling brook for all the&#10;intelligence my speech carried to him, but he understood the action&#10;with which I immediately followed my words.&#10;&#10;Stretching my hand toward him, I advanced and took the armlet from his&#10;open palm, clasping it about my arm above the elbow; smiled at him and&#10;stood waiting.  His wide mouth spread into an answering smile, and&#10;locking one of his intermediary arms in mine we turned and walked back&#10;toward his mount.  At the same time he motioned his followers to&#10;advance.  They started toward us on a wild run, but were checked by a&#10;signal from him.  Evidently he feared that were I to be really&#10;frightened again I might jump entirely out of the landscape.&#10;&#10;He exchanged a few words with his men, motioned to me that I would ride&#10;behind one of them, and then mounted his own animal.  The fellow&#10;designated reached down two or three hands and lifted me up behind him&#10;on the glossy back of his mount, where I hung on as best I could by the&#10;belts and straps which held the Martian's weapons and ornaments.&#10;&#10;The entire cavalcade then turned and galloped away toward the range of&#10;hills in the distance.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER IV&#10;&#10;A PRISONER&#10;&#10;&#10;We had gone perhaps ten miles when the ground began to rise very&#10;rapidly.  We were, as I was later to learn, nearing the edge of one of&#10;Mars' long-dead seas, in the bottom of which my encounter with the&#10;Martians had taken place.&#10;&#10;In a short time we gained the foot of the mountains, and after&#10;traversing a narrow gorge came to an open valley, at the far extremity&#10;of which was a low table land upon which I beheld an enormous city.&#10;Toward this we galloped, entering it by what appeared to be a ruined&#10;roadway leading out from the city, but only to the edge of the table&#10;land, where it ended abruptly in a flight of broad steps.&#10;&#10;Upon closer observation I saw as we passed them that the buildings were&#10;deserted, and while not greatly decayed had the appearance of not&#10;having been tenanted for years, possibly for ages.  Toward the center&#10;of the city was a large plaza, and upon this and in the buildings&#10;immediately surrounding it were camped some nine or ten hundred&#10;creatures of the same breed as my captors, for such I now considered&#10;them despite the suave manner in which I had been trapped.&#10;&#10;With the exception of their ornaments all were naked.  The women varied&#10;in appearance but little from the men, except that their tusks were&#10;much larger in proportion to their height, in some instances curving&#10;nearly to their high-set ears.  Their bodies were smaller and lighter&#10;in color, and their fingers and toes bore the rudiments of nails, which&#10;were entirely lacking among the males.  The adult females ranged in&#10;height from ten to twelve feet.&#10;&#10;The children were light in color, even lighter than the women, and all&#10;looked precisely alike to me, except that some were taller than others;&#10;older, I presumed.&#10;&#10;I saw no signs of extreme age among them, nor is there any appreciable&#10;difference in their appearance from the age of maturity, about forty,&#10;until, at about the age of one thousand years, they go voluntarily upon&#10;their last strange pilgrimage down the river Iss, which leads no living&#10;Martian knows whither and from whose bosom no Martian has ever&#10;returned, or would be allowed to live did he return after once&#10;embarking upon its cold, dark waters.&#10;&#10;Only about one Martian in a thousand dies of sickness or disease, and&#10;possibly about twenty take the voluntary pilgrimage.  The other nine&#10;hundred and seventy-nine die violent deaths in duels, in hunting, in&#10;aviation and in war; but perhaps by far the greatest death loss comes&#10;during the age of childhood, when vast numbers of the little Martians&#10;fall victims to the great white apes of Mars.&#10;&#10;The average life expectancy of a Martian after the age of maturity is&#10;about three hundred years, but would be nearer the one-thousand mark&#10;were it not for the various means leading to violent death.  Owing to&#10;the waning resources of the planet it evidently became necessary to&#10;counteract the increasing longevity which their remarkable skill in&#10;therapeutics and surgery produced, and so human life has come to be&#10;considered but lightly on Mars, as is evidenced by their dangerous&#10;sports and the almost continual warfare between the various communities.&#10;&#10;There are other and natural causes tending toward a diminution of&#10;population, but nothing contributes so greatly to this end as the fact&#10;that no male or female Martian is ever voluntarily without a weapon of&#10;destruction.&#10;&#10;As we neared the plaza and my presence was discovered we were&#10;immediately surrounded by hundreds of the creatures who seemed anxious&#10;to pluck me from my seat behind my guard.  A word from the leader of&#10;the party stilled their clamor, and we proceeded at a trot across the&#10;plaza to the entrance of as magnificent an edifice as mortal eye has&#10;rested upon.&#10;&#10;The building was low, but covered an enormous area.  It was constructed&#10;of gleaming white marble inlaid with gold and brilliant stones which&#10;sparkled and scintillated in the sunlight.  The main entrance was some&#10;hundred feet in width and projected from the building proper to form a&#10;huge canopy above the entrance hall.  There was no stairway, but a&#10;gentle incline to the first floor of the building opened into an&#10;enormous chamber encircled by galleries.&#10;&#10;On the floor of this chamber, which was dotted with highly carved&#10;wooden desks and chairs, were assembled about forty or fifty male&#10;Martians around the steps of a rostrum.  On the platform proper&#10;squatted an enormous warrior heavily loaded with metal ornaments,&#10;gay-colored feathers and beautifully wrought leather trappings&#10;ingeniously set with precious stones.  From his shoulders depended a&#10;short cape of white fur lined with brilliant scarlet silk.&#10;&#10;What struck me as most remarkable about this assemblage and the hall in&#10;which they were congregated was the fact that the creatures were&#10;entirely out of proportion to the desks, chairs, and other furnishings;&#10;these being of a size adapted to human beings such as I, whereas the&#10;great bulks of the Martians could scarcely have squeezed into the&#10;chairs, nor was there room beneath the desks for their long legs.&#10;Evidently, then, there were other denizens on Mars than the wild and&#10;grotesque creatures into whose hands I had fallen, but the evidences of&#10;extreme antiquity which showed all around me indicated that these&#10;buildings might have belonged to some long-extinct and forgotten race&#10;in the dim antiquity of Mars.&#10;&#10;Our party had halted at the entrance to the building, and at a sign&#10;from the leader I had been lowered to the ground.  Again locking his&#10;arm in mine, we had proceeded into the audience chamber.  There were&#10;few formalities observed in approaching the Martian chieftain.  My&#10;captor merely strode up to the rostrum, the others making way for him&#10;as he advanced.  The chieftain rose to his feet and uttered the name of&#10;my escort who, in turn, halted and repeated the name of the ruler&#10;followed by his title.&#10;&#10;At the time, this ceremony and the words they uttered meant nothing to&#10;me, but later I came to know that this was the customary greeting&#10;between green Martians.  Had the men been strangers, and therefore&#10;unable to exchange names, they would have silently exchanged ornaments,&#10;had their missions been peaceful--otherwise they would have exchanged&#10;shots, or have fought out their introduction with some other of their&#10;various weapons.&#10;&#10;My captor, whose name was Tars Tarkas, was virtually the vice-chieftain&#10;of the community, and a man of great ability as a statesman and&#10;warrior.  He evidently explained briefly the incidents connected with&#10;his expedition, including my capture, and when he had concluded the&#10;chieftain addressed me at some length.&#10;&#10;I replied in our good old English tongue merely to convince him that&#10;neither of us could understand the other; but I noticed that when I&#10;smiled slightly on concluding, he did likewise.  This fact, and the&#10;similar occurrence during my first talk with Tars Tarkas, convinced me&#10;that we had at least something in common; the ability to smile,&#10;therefore to laugh; denoting a sense of humor.  But I was to learn that&#10;the Martian smile is merely perfunctory, and that the Martian laugh is&#10;a thing to cause strong men to blanch in horror.&#10;&#10;The ideas of humor among the green men of Mars are widely at variance&#10;with our conceptions of incitants to merriment.  The death agonies of a&#10;fellow being are, to these strange creatures, provocative of the wildest&#10;hilarity, while their chief form of commonest amusement is to inflict&#10;death on their prisoners of war in various ingenious and horrible ways.&#10;&#10;The assembled warriors and chieftains examined me closely, feeling my&#10;muscles and the texture of my skin.  The principal chieftain then&#10;evidently signified a desire to see me perform, and, motioning me to&#10;follow, he started with Tars Tarkas for the open plaza.&#10;&#10;Now, I had made no attempt to walk, since my first signal failure,&#10;except while tightly grasping Tars Tarkas' arm, and so now I went&#10;skipping and flitting about among the desks and chairs like some&#10;monstrous grasshopper.  After bruising myself severely, much to the&#10;amusement of the Martians, I again had recourse to creeping, but this&#10;did not suit them and I was roughly jerked to my feet by a towering&#10;fellow who had laughed most heartily at my misfortunes.&#10;&#10;As he banged me down upon my feet his face was bent close to mine and I&#10;did the only thing a gentleman might do under the circumstances of&#10;brutality, boorishness, and lack of consideration for a stranger's&#10;rights; I swung my fist squarely to his jaw and he went down like a&#10;felled ox.  As he sunk to the floor I wheeled around with my back&#10;toward the nearest desk, expecting to be overwhelmed by the vengeance&#10;of his fellows, but determined to give them as good a battle as the&#10;unequal odds would permit before I gave up my life.&#10;&#10;My fears were groundless, however, as the other Martians, at first&#10;struck dumb with wonderment, finally broke into wild peals of laughter&#10;and applause.  I did not recognize the applause as such, but later,&#10;when I had become acquainted with their customs, I learned that I had&#10;won what they seldom accord, a manifestation of approbation.&#10;&#10;The fellow whom I had struck lay where he had fallen, nor did any of&#10;his mates approach him.  Tars Tarkas advanced toward me, holding out&#10;one of his arms, and we thus proceeded to the plaza without further&#10;mishap.  I did not, of course, know the reason for which we had come to&#10;the open, but I was not long in being enlightened.  They first repeated&#10;the word &quot;sak&quot; a number of times, and then Tars Tarkas made several&#10;jumps, repeating the same word before each leap; then, turning to me,&#10;he said, &quot;sak!&quot;  I saw what they were after, and gathering myself&#10;together I &quot;sakked&quot; with such marvelous success that I cleared a good&#10;hundred and fifty feet; nor did I, this time, lose my equilibrium, but&#10;landed squarely upon my feet without falling.  I then returned by easy&#10;jumps of twenty-five or thirty feet to the little group of warriors.&#10;&#10;My exhibition had been witnessed by several hundred lesser Martians,&#10;and they immediately broke into demands for a repetition, which the&#10;chieftain then ordered me to make; but I was both hungry and thirsty,&#10;and determined on the spot that my only method of salvation was to&#10;demand the consideration from these creatures which they evidently&#10;would not voluntarily accord.  I therefore ignored the repeated&#10;commands to &quot;sak,&quot; and each time they were made I motioned to my mouth&#10;and rubbed my stomach.&#10;&#10;Tars Tarkas and the chief exchanged a few words, and the former,&#10;calling to a young female among the throng, gave her some instructions&#10;and motioned me to accompany her.  I grasped her proffered arm and&#10;together we crossed the plaza toward a large building on the far side.&#10;&#10;My fair companion was about eight feet tall, having just arrived at&#10;maturity, but not yet to her full height.  She was of a light&#10;olive-green color, with a smooth, glossy hide.  Her name, as I&#10;afterward learned, was Sola, and she belonged to the retinue of Tars&#10;Tarkas.  She conducted me to a spacious chamber in one of the buildings&#10;fronting on the plaza, and which, from the litter of silks and furs&#10;upon the floor, I took to be the sleeping quarters of several of the&#10;natives.&#10;&#10;The room was well lighted by a number of large windows and was&#10;beautifully decorated with mural paintings and mosaics, but upon all&#10;there seemed to rest that indefinable touch of the finger of antiquity&#10;which convinced me that the architects and builders of these wondrous&#10;creations had nothing in common with the crude half-brutes which now&#10;occupied them.&#10;&#10;Sola motioned me to be seated upon a pile of silks near the center of&#10;the room, and, turning, made a peculiar hissing sound, as though&#10;signaling to someone in an adjoining room.  In response to her call I&#10;obtained my first sight of a new Martian wonder.  It waddled in on its&#10;ten short legs, and squatted down before the girl like an obedient&#10;puppy.  The thing was about the size of a Shetland pony, but its head&#10;bore a slight resemblance to that of a frog, except that the jaws were&#10;equipped with three rows of long, sharp tusks.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER V&#10;&#10;I ELUDE MY WATCH DOG&#10;&#10;&#10;Sola stared into the brute's wicked-looking eyes, muttered a word or&#10;two of command, pointed to me, and left the chamber.  I could not but&#10;wonder what this ferocious-looking monstrosity might do when left alone&#10;in such close proximity to such a relatively tender morsel of meat; but&#10;my fears were groundless, as the beast, after surveying me intently for&#10;a moment, crossed the room to the only exit which led to the street,&#10;and lay down full length across the threshold.&#10;&#10;This was my first experience with a Martian watch dog, but it was&#10;destined not to be my last, for this fellow guarded me carefully during&#10;the time I remained a captive among these green men; twice saving my&#10;life, and never voluntarily being away from me a moment.&#10;&#10;While Sola was away I took occasion to examine more minutely the room&#10;in which I found myself captive.  The mural painting depicted scenes of&#10;rare and wonderful beauty; mountains, rivers, lake, ocean, meadow,&#10;trees and flowers, winding roadways, sun-kissed gardens--scenes which&#10;might have portrayed earthly views but for the different colorings of&#10;the vegetation.  The work had evidently been wrought by a master hand,&#10;so subtle the atmosphere, so perfect the technique; yet nowhere was&#10;there a representation of a living animal, either human or brute, by&#10;which I could guess at the likeness of these other and perhaps extinct&#10;denizens of Mars.&#10;&#10;While I was allowing my fancy to run riot in wild conjecture on the&#10;possible explanation of the strange anomalies which I had so far met&#10;with on Mars, Sola returned bearing both food and drink.  These she&#10;placed on the floor beside me, and seating herself a short ways off&#10;regarded me intently.  The food consisted of about a pound of some&#10;solid substance of the consistency of cheese and almost tasteless,&#10;while the liquid was apparently milk from some animal.  It was not&#10;unpleasant to the taste, though slightly acid, and I learned in a short&#10;time to prize it very highly.  It came, as I later discovered, not from&#10;an animal, as there is only one mammal on Mars and that one very rare&#10;indeed, but from a large plant which grows practically without water,&#10;but seems to distill its plentiful supply of milk from the products of&#10;the soil, the moisture of the air, and the rays of the sun.  A single&#10;plant of this species will give eight or ten quarts of milk per day.&#10;&#10;After I had eaten I was greatly invigorated, but feeling the need of&#10;rest I stretched out upon the silks and was soon asleep.  I must have&#10;slept several hours, as it was dark when I awoke, and I was very cold.&#10;I noticed that someone had thrown a fur over me, but it had become&#10;partially dislodged and in the darkness I could not see to replace it.&#10;Suddenly a hand reached out and pulled the fur over me, shortly&#10;afterwards adding another to my covering.&#10;&#10;I presumed that my watchful guardian was Sola, nor was I wrong.  This&#10;girl alone, among all the green Martians with whom I came in contact,&#10;disclosed characteristics of sympathy, kindliness, and affection; her&#10;ministrations to my bodily wants were unfailing, and her solicitous&#10;care saved me from much suffering and many hardships.&#10;&#10;As I was to learn, the Martian nights are extremely cold, and as there&#10;is practically no twilight or dawn, the changes in temperature are&#10;sudden and most uncomfortable, as are the transitions from brilliant&#10;daylight to darkness.  The nights are either brilliantly illumined or&#10;very dark, for if neither of the two moons of Mars happen to be in the&#10;sky almost total darkness results, since the lack of atmosphere, or,&#10;rather, the very thin atmosphere, fails to diffuse the starlight to any&#10;great extent; on the other hand, if both of the moons are in the&#10;heavens at night the surface of the ground is brightly illuminated.&#10;&#10;Both of Mars' moons are vastly nearer her than is our moon to Earth;&#10;the nearer moon being but about five thousand miles distant, while the&#10;further is but little more than fourteen thousand miles away, against&#10;the nearly one-quarter million miles which separate us from our moon.&#10;The nearer moon of Mars makes a complete revolution around the planet&#10;in a little over seven and one-half hours, so that she may be seen&#10;hurtling through the sky like some huge meteor two or three times each&#10;night, revealing all her phases during each transit of the heavens.&#10;&#10;The further moon revolves about Mars in something over thirty and&#10;one-quarter hours, and with her sister satellite makes a nocturnal&#10;Martian scene one of splendid and weird grandeur.  And it is well that&#10;nature has so graciously and abundantly lighted the Martian night, for&#10;the green men of Mars, being a nomadic race without high intellectual&#10;development, have but crude means for artificial lighting; depending&#10;principally upon torches, a kind of candle, and a peculiar oil lamp&#10;which generates a gas and burns without a wick.&#10;&#10;This last device produces an intensely brilliant far-reaching white&#10;light, but as the natural oil which it requires can only be obtained by&#10;mining in one of several widely separated and remote localities it is&#10;seldom used by these creatures whose only thought is for today, and&#10;whose hatred for manual labor has kept them in a semi-barbaric state&#10;for countless ages.&#10;&#10;After Sola had replenished my coverings I again slept, nor did I awaken&#10;until daylight.  The other occupants of the room, five in number, were&#10;all females, and they were still sleeping, piled high with a motley&#10;array of silks and furs.  Across the threshold lay stretched the&#10;sleepless guardian brute, just as I had last seen him on the preceding&#10;day; apparently he had not moved a muscle; his eyes were fairly glued&#10;upon me, and I fell to wondering just what might befall me should I&#10;endeavor to escape.&#10;&#10;I have ever been prone to seek adventure and to investigate and&#10;experiment where wiser men would have left well enough alone.  It&#10;therefore now occurred to me that the surest way of learning the exact&#10;attitude of this beast toward me would be to attempt to leave the room.&#10;I felt fairly secure in my belief that I could escape him should he&#10;pursue me once I was outside the building, for I had begun to take&#10;great pride in my ability as a jumper.  Furthermore, I could see from&#10;the shortness of his legs that the brute himself was no jumper and&#10;probably no runner.&#10;&#10;Slowly and carefully, therefore, I gained my feet, only to see that my&#10;watcher did the same; cautiously I advanced toward him, finding that by&#10;moving with a shuffling gait I could retain my balance as well as make&#10;reasonably rapid progress.  As I neared the brute he backed cautiously&#10;away from me, and when I had reached the open he moved to one side to&#10;let me pass.  He then fell in behind me and followed about ten paces in&#10;my rear as I made my way along the deserted street.&#10;&#10;Evidently his mission was to protect me only, I thought, but when we&#10;reached the edge of the city he suddenly sprang before me, uttering&#10;strange sounds and baring his ugly and ferocious tusks.  Thinking to&#10;have some amusement at his expense, I rushed toward him, and when&#10;almost upon him sprang into the air, alighting far beyond him and away&#10;from the city.  He wheeled instantly and charged me with the most&#10;appalling speed I had ever beheld.  I had thought his short legs a bar&#10;to swiftness, but had he been coursing with greyhounds the latter would&#10;have appeared as though asleep on a door mat.  As I was to learn, this&#10;is the fleetest animal on Mars, and owing to its intelligence, loyalty,&#10;and ferocity is used in hunting, in war, and as the protector of the&#10;Martian man.&#10;&#10;I quickly saw that I would have difficulty in escaping the fangs of the&#10;beast on a straightaway course, and so I met his charge by doubling in&#10;my tracks and leaping over him as he was almost upon me.  This maneuver&#10;gave me a considerable advantage, and I was able to reach the city&#10;quite a bit ahead of him, and as he came tearing after me I jumped for&#10;a window about thirty feet from the ground in the face of one of the&#10;buildings overlooking the valley.&#10;&#10;Grasping the sill I pulled myself up to a sitting posture without&#10;looking into the building, and gazed down at the baffled animal beneath&#10;me.  My exultation was short-lived, however, for scarcely had I gained&#10;a secure seat upon the sill than a huge hand grasped me by the neck&#10;from behind and dragged me violently into the room.  Here I was thrown&#10;upon my back, and beheld standing over me a colossal ape-like creature,&#10;white and hairless except for an enormous shock of bristly hair upon&#10;its head.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER VI&#10;&#10;A FIGHT THAT WON FRIENDS&#10;&#10;&#10;The thing, which more nearly resembled our earthly men than it did the&#10;Martians I had seen, held me pinioned to the ground with one huge foot,&#10;while it jabbered and gesticulated at some answering creature behind&#10;me.  This other, which was evidently its mate, soon came toward us,&#10;bearing a mighty stone cudgel with which it evidently intended to brain&#10;me.&#10;&#10;The creatures were about ten or fifteen feet tall, standing erect, and&#10;had, like the green Martians, an intermediary set of arms or legs,&#10;midway between their upper and lower limbs.  Their eyes were close&#10;together and non-protruding; their ears were high set, but more&#10;laterally located than those of the Martians, while their snouts and&#10;teeth were strikingly like those of our African gorilla.  Altogether&#10;they were not unlovely when viewed in comparison with the green&#10;Martians.&#10;&#10;The cudgel was swinging in the arc which ended upon my upturned face&#10;when a bolt of myriad-legged horror hurled itself through the doorway&#10;full upon the breast of my executioner.  With a shriek of fear the ape&#10;which held me leaped through the open window, but its mate closed in a&#10;terrific death struggle with my preserver, which was nothing less than&#10;my faithful watch-thing; I cannot bring myself to call so hideous a&#10;creature a dog.&#10;&#10;As quickly as possible I gained my feet and backing against the wall I&#10;witnessed such a battle as it is vouchsafed few beings to see.  The&#10;strength, agility, and blind ferocity of these two creatures is&#10;approached by nothing known to earthly man.  My beast had an advantage&#10;in his first hold, having sunk his mighty fangs far into the breast of&#10;his adversary; but the great arms and paws of the ape, backed by&#10;muscles far transcending those of the Martian men I had seen, had&#10;locked the throat of my guardian and slowly were choking out his life,&#10;and bending back his head and neck upon his body, where I momentarily&#10;expected the former to fall limp at the end of a broken neck.&#10;&#10;In accomplishing this the ape was tearing away the entire front of its&#10;breast, which was held in the vise-like grip of the powerful jaws.&#10;Back and forth upon the floor they rolled, neither one emitting a sound&#10;of fear or pain.  Presently I saw the great eyes of my beast bulging&#10;completely from their sockets and blood flowing from its nostrils.&#10;That he was weakening perceptibly was evident, but so also was the ape,&#10;whose struggles were growing momentarily less.&#10;&#10;Suddenly I came to myself and, with that strange instinct which seems&#10;ever to prompt me to my duty, I seized the cudgel, which had fallen to&#10;the floor at the commencement of the battle, and swinging it with all&#10;the power of my earthly arms I crashed it full upon the head of the&#10;ape, crushing his skull as though it had been an eggshell.&#10;&#10;Scarcely had the blow descended when I was confronted with a new&#10;danger.  The ape's mate, recovered from its first shock of terror, had&#10;returned to the scene of the encounter by way of the interior of the&#10;building.  I glimpsed him just before he reached the doorway and the&#10;sight of him, now roaring as he perceived his lifeless fellow stretched&#10;upon the floor, and frothing at the mouth, in the extremity of his&#10;rage, filled me, I must confess, with dire forebodings.&#10;&#10;I am ever willing to stand and fight when the odds are not too&#10;overwhelmingly against me, but in this instance I perceived neither&#10;glory nor profit in pitting my relatively puny strength against the&#10;iron muscles and brutal ferocity of this enraged denizen of an unknown&#10;world; in fact, the only outcome of such an encounter, so far as I&#10;might be concerned, seemed sudden death.&#10;&#10;I was standing near the window and I knew that once in the street I&#10;might gain the plaza and safety before the creature could overtake me;&#10;at least there was a chance for safety in flight, against almost&#10;certain death should I remain and fight however desperately.&#10;&#10;It is true I held the cudgel, but what could I do with it against his&#10;four great arms?  Even should I break one of them with my first blow,&#10;for I figured that he would attempt to ward off the cudgel, he could&#10;reach out and annihilate me with the others before I could recover for&#10;a second attack.&#10;&#10;In the instant that these thoughts passed through my mind I had turned&#10;to make for the window, but my eyes alighting on the form of my&#10;erstwhile guardian threw all thoughts of flight to the four winds.  He&#10;lay gasping upon the floor of the chamber, his great eyes fastened upon&#10;me in what seemed a pitiful appeal for protection.  I could not&#10;withstand that look, nor could I, on second thought, have deserted my&#10;rescuer without giving as good an account of myself in his behalf as he&#10;had in mine.&#10;&#10;Without more ado, therefore, I turned to meet the charge of the&#10;infuriated bull ape.  He was now too close upon me for the cudgel to&#10;prove of any effective assistance, so I merely threw it as heavily as I&#10;could at his advancing bulk.  It struck him just below the knees,&#10;eliciting a howl of pain and rage, and so throwing him off his balance&#10;that he lunged full upon me with arms wide stretched to ease his fall.&#10;&#10;Again, as on the preceding day, I had recourse to earthly tactics, and&#10;swinging my right fist full upon the point of his chin I followed it&#10;with a smashing left to the pit of his stomach.  The effect was&#10;marvelous, for, as I lightly sidestepped, after delivering the second&#10;blow, he reeled and fell upon the floor doubled up with pain and&#10;gasping for wind.  Leaping over his prostrate body, I seized the cudgel&#10;and finished the monster before he could regain his feet.&#10;&#10;As I delivered the blow a low laugh rang out behind me, and, turning, I&#10;beheld Tars Tarkas, Sola, and three or four warriors standing in the&#10;doorway of the chamber.  As my eyes met theirs I was, for the second&#10;time, the recipient of their zealously guarded applause.&#10;&#10;My absence had been noted by Sola on her awakening, and she had quickly&#10;informed Tars Tarkas, who had set out immediately with a handful of&#10;warriors to search for me.  As they had approached the limits of the&#10;city they had witnessed the actions of the bull ape as he bolted into&#10;the building, frothing with rage.&#10;&#10;They had followed immediately behind him, thinking it barely possible&#10;that his actions might prove a clew to my whereabouts and had witnessed&#10;my short but decisive battle with him.  This encounter, together with&#10;my set-to with the Martian warrior on the previous day and my feats of&#10;jumping placed me upon a high pinnacle in their regard.  Evidently&#10;devoid of all the finer sentiments of friendship, love, or affection,&#10;these people fairly worship physical prowess and bravery, and nothing&#10;is too good for the object of their adoration as long as he maintains&#10;his position by repeated examples of his skill, strength, and courage.&#10;&#10;Sola, who had accompanied the searching party of her own volition, was&#10;the only one of the Martians whose face had not been twisted in&#10;laughter as I battled for my life.  She, on the contrary, was sober&#10;with apparent solicitude and, as soon as I had finished the monster,&#10;rushed to me and carefully examined my body for possible wounds or&#10;injuries.  Satisfying herself that I had come off unscathed she smiled&#10;quietly, and, taking my hand, started toward the door of the chamber.&#10;&#10;Tars Tarkas and the other warriors had entered and were standing over&#10;the now rapidly reviving brute which had saved my life, and whose life&#10;I, in turn, had rescued.  They seemed to be deep in argument, and&#10;finally one of them addressed me, but remembering my ignorance of his&#10;language turned back to Tars Tarkas, who, with a word and gesture, gave&#10;some command to the fellow and turned to follow us from the room.&#10;&#10;There seemed something menacing in their attitude toward my beast, and&#10;I hesitated to leave until I had learned the outcome.  It was well I&#10;did so, for the warrior drew an evil looking pistol from its holster&#10;and was on the point of putting an end to the creature when I sprang&#10;forward and struck up his arm.  The bullet striking the wooden casing&#10;of the window exploded, blowing a hole completely through the wood and&#10;masonry.&#10;&#10;I then knelt down beside the fearsome-looking thing, and raising it to&#10;its feet motioned for it to follow me.  The looks of surprise which my&#10;actions elicited from the Martians were ludicrous; they could not&#10;understand, except in a feeble and childish way, such attributes as&#10;gratitude and compassion.  The warrior whose gun I had struck up looked&#10;enquiringly at Tars Tarkas, but the latter signed that I be left to my&#10;own devices, and so we returned to the plaza with my great beast&#10;following close at heel, and Sola grasping me tightly by the arm.&#10;&#10;I had at least two friends on Mars; a young woman who watched over me&#10;with motherly solicitude, and a dumb brute which, as I later came to&#10;know, held in its poor ugly carcass more love, more loyalty, more&#10;gratitude than could have been found in the entire five million green&#10;Martians who rove the deserted cities and dead sea bottoms of Mars.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER VII&#10;&#10;CHILD-RAISING ON MARS&#10;&#10;&#10;After a breakfast, which was an exact replica of the meal of the&#10;preceding day and an index of practically every meal which followed&#10;while I was with the green men of Mars, Sola escorted me to the plaza,&#10;where I found the entire community engaged in watching or helping at&#10;the harnessing of huge mastodonian animals to great three-wheeled&#10;chariots.  There were about two hundred and fifty of these vehicles,&#10;each drawn by a single animal, any one of which, from their appearance,&#10;might easily have drawn the entire wagon train when fully loaded.&#10;&#10;The chariots themselves were large, commodious, and gorgeously&#10;decorated.  In each was seated a female Martian loaded with ornaments&#10;of metal, with jewels and silks and furs, and upon the back of each of&#10;the beasts which drew the chariots was perched a young Martian driver.&#10;Like the animals upon which the warriors were mounted, the heavier&#10;draft animals wore neither bit nor bridle, but were guided entirely by&#10;telepathic means.&#10;&#10;This power is wonderfully developed in all Martians, and accounts&#10;largely for the simplicity of their language and the relatively few&#10;spoken words exchanged even in long conversations.  It is the universal&#10;language of Mars, through the medium of which the higher and lower&#10;animals of this world of paradoxes are able to communicate to a greater&#10;or less extent, depending upon the intellectual sphere of the species&#10;and the development of the individual.&#10;&#10;As the cavalcade took up the line of march in single file, Sola dragged&#10;me into an empty chariot and we proceeded with the procession toward&#10;the point by which I had entered the city the day before.  At the head&#10;of the caravan rode some two hundred warriors, five abreast, and a like&#10;number brought up the rear, while twenty-five or thirty outriders&#10;flanked us on either side.&#10;&#10;Every one but myself--men, women, and children--were heavily armed, and&#10;at the tail of each chariot trotted a Martian hound, my own beast&#10;following closely behind ours; in fact, the faithful creature never&#10;left me voluntarily during the entire ten years I spent on Mars.  Our&#10;way led out across the little valley before the city, through the&#10;hills, and down into the dead sea bottom which I had traversed on my&#10;journey from the incubator to the plaza.  The incubator, as it proved,&#10;was the terminal point of our journey this day, and, as the entire&#10;cavalcade broke into a mad gallop as soon as we reached the level&#10;expanse of sea bottom, we were soon within sight of our goal.&#10;&#10;On reaching it the chariots were parked with military precision on the&#10;four sides of the enclosure, and half a score of warriors, headed by&#10;the enormous chieftain, and including Tars Tarkas and several other&#10;lesser chiefs, dismounted and advanced toward it.  I could see Tars&#10;Tarkas explaining something to the principal chieftain, whose name, by&#10;the way, was, as nearly as I can translate it into English, Lorquas&#10;Ptomel, Jed; jed being his title.&#10;&#10;I was soon appraised of the subject of their conversation, as, calling&#10;to Sola, Tars Tarkas signed for her to send me to him.  I had by this&#10;time mastered the intricacies of walking under Martian conditions, and&#10;quickly responding to his command I advanced to the side of the&#10;incubator where the warriors stood.&#10;&#10;As I reached their side a glance showed me that all but a very few eggs&#10;had hatched, the incubator being fairly alive with the hideous little&#10;devils.  They ranged in height from three to four feet, and were moving&#10;restlessly about the enclosure as though searching for food.&#10;&#10;As I came to a halt before him, Tars Tarkas pointed over the incubator&#10;and said, &quot;Sak.&quot;  I saw that he wanted me to repeat my performance of&#10;yesterday for the edification of Lorquas Ptomel, and, as I must confess&#10;that my prowess gave me no little satisfaction, I responded quickly,&#10;leaping entirely over the parked chariots on the far side of the&#10;incubator.  As I returned, Lorquas Ptomel grunted something at me, and&#10;turning to his warriors gave a few words of command relative to the&#10;incubator.  They paid no further attention to me and I was thus&#10;permitted to remain close and watch their operations, which consisted&#10;in breaking an opening in the wall of the incubator large enough to&#10;permit of the exit of the young Martians.&#10;&#10;On either side of this opening the women and the younger Martians, both&#10;male and female, formed two solid walls leading out through the&#10;chariots and quite away into the plain beyond.  Between these walls the&#10;little Martians scampered, wild as deer; being permitted to run the&#10;full length of the aisle, where they were captured one at a time by the&#10;women and older children; the last in the line capturing the first&#10;little one to reach the end of the gauntlet, her opposite in the line&#10;capturing the second, and so on until all the little fellows had left&#10;the enclosure and been appropriated by some youth or female.  As the&#10;women caught the young they fell out of line and returned to their&#10;respective chariots, while those who fell into the hands of the young&#10;men were later turned over to some of the women.&#10;&#10;I saw that the ceremony, if it could be dignified by such a name, was&#10;over, and seeking out Sola I found her in our chariot with a hideous&#10;little creature held tightly in her arms.&#10;&#10;The work of rearing young, green Martians consists solely in teaching&#10;them to talk, and to use the weapons of warfare with which they are&#10;loaded down from the very first year of their lives.  Coming from eggs&#10;in which they have lain for five years, the period of incubation, they&#10;step forth into the world perfectly developed except in size.  Entirely&#10;unknown to their mothers, who, in turn, would have difficulty in&#10;pointing out the fathers with any degree of accuracy, they are the&#10;common children of the community, and their education devolves upon the&#10;females who chance to capture them as they leave the incubator.&#10;&#10;Their foster mothers may not even have had an egg in the incubator, as&#10;was the case with Sola, who had not commenced to lay, until less than a&#10;year before she became the mother of another woman's offspring.  But&#10;this counts for little among the green Martians, as parental and filial&#10;love is as unknown to them as it is common among us.  I believe this&#10;horrible system which has been carried on for ages is the direct cause&#10;of the loss of all the finer feelings and higher humanitarian instincts&#10;among these poor creatures.  From birth they know no father or mother&#10;love, they know not the meaning of the word home; they are taught that&#10;they are only suffered to live until they can demonstrate by their&#10;physique and ferocity that they are fit to live.  Should they prove&#10;deformed or defective in any way they are promptly shot; nor do they&#10;see a tear shed for a single one of the many cruel hardships they pass&#10;through from earliest infancy.&#10;&#10;I do not mean that the adult Martians are unnecessarily or&#10;intentionally cruel to the young, but theirs is a hard and pitiless&#10;struggle for existence upon a dying planet, the natural resources of&#10;which have dwindled to a point where the support of each additional&#10;life means an added tax upon the community into which it is thrown.&#10;&#10;By careful selection they rear only the hardiest specimens of each&#10;species, and with almost supernatural foresight they regulate the birth&#10;rate to merely offset the loss by death.&#10;&#10;Each adult Martian female brings forth about thirteen eggs each year,&#10;and those which meet the size, weight, and specific gravity tests are&#10;hidden in the recesses of some subterranean vault where the temperature&#10;is too low for incubation.  Every year these eggs are carefully&#10;examined by a council of twenty chieftains, and all but about one&#10;hundred of the most perfect are destroyed out of each yearly supply.&#10;At the end of five years about five hundred almost perfect eggs have&#10;been chosen from the thousands brought forth.  These are then placed in&#10;the almost air-tight incubators to be hatched by the sun's rays after a&#10;period of another five years.  The hatching which we had witnessed&#10;today was a fairly representative event of its kind, all but about one&#10;per cent of the eggs hatching in two days.  If the remaining eggs ever&#10;hatched we knew nothing of the fate of the little Martians.  They were&#10;not wanted, as their offspring might inherit and transmit the tendency&#10;to prolonged incubation, and thus upset the system which has maintained&#10;for ages and which permits the adult Martians to figure the proper time&#10;for return to the incubators, almost to an hour.&#10;&#10;The incubators are built in remote fastnesses, where there is little or&#10;no likelihood of their being discovered by other tribes.  The result of&#10;such a catastrophe would mean no children in the community for another&#10;five years.  I was later to witness the results of the discovery of an&#10;alien incubator.&#10;&#10;The community of which the green Martians with whom my lot was cast&#10;formed a part was composed of some thirty thousand souls.  They roamed&#10;an enormous tract of arid and semi-arid land between forty and eighty&#10;degrees south latitude, and bounded on the east and west by two large&#10;fertile tracts.  Their headquarters lay in the southwest corner of this&#10;district, near the crossing of two of the so-called Martian canals.&#10;&#10;As the incubator had been placed far north of their own territory in a&#10;supposedly uninhabited and unfrequented area, we had before us a&#10;tremendous journey, concerning which I, of course, knew nothing.&#10;&#10;After our return to the dead city I passed several days in comparative&#10;idleness.  On the day following our return all the warriors had ridden&#10;forth early in the morning and had not returned until just before&#10;darkness fell.  As I later learned, they had been to the subterranean&#10;vaults in which the eggs were kept and had transported them to the&#10;incubator, which they had then walled up for another five years, and&#10;which, in all probability, would not be visited again during that&#10;period.&#10;&#10;The vaults which hid the eggs until they were ready for the incubator&#10;were located many miles south of the incubator, and would be visited&#10;yearly by the council of twenty chieftains.  Why they did not arrange&#10;to build their vaults and incubators nearer home has always been a&#10;mystery to me, and, like many other Martian mysteries, unsolved and&#10;unsolvable by earthly reasoning and customs.&#10;&#10;Sola's duties were now doubled, as she was compelled to care for the&#10;young Martian as well as for me, but neither one of us required much&#10;attention, and as we were both about equally advanced in Martian&#10;education, Sola took it upon herself to train us together.&#10;&#10;Her prize consisted in a male about four feet tall, very strong and&#10;physically perfect; also, he learned quickly, and we had considerable&#10;amusement, at least I did, over the keen rivalry we displayed.  The&#10;Martian language, as I have said, is extremely simple, and in a week I&#10;could make all my wants known and understand nearly everything that was&#10;said to me.  Likewise, under Sola's tutelage, I developed my telepathic&#10;powers so that I shortly could sense practically everything that went&#10;on around me.&#10;&#10;What surprised Sola most in me was that while I could catch telepathic&#10;messages easily from others, and often when they were not intended for&#10;me, no one could read a jot from my mind under any circumstances.  At&#10;first this vexed me, but later I was very glad of it, as it gave me an&#10;undoubted advantage over the Martians.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER VIII&#10;&#10;A FAIR CAPTIVE FROM THE SKY&#10;&#10;&#10;The third day after the incubator ceremony we set forth toward home,&#10;but scarcely had the head of the procession debouched into the open&#10;ground before the city than orders were given for an immediate and&#10;hasty return.  As though trained for years in this particular&#10;evolution, the green Martians melted like mist into the spacious&#10;doorways of the nearby buildings, until, in less than three minutes,&#10;the entire cavalcade of chariots, mastodons and mounted warriors was&#10;nowhere to be seen.&#10;&#10;Sola and I had entered a building upon the front of the city, in fact,&#10;the same one in which I had had my encounter with the apes, and,&#10;wishing to see what had caused the sudden retreat, I mounted to an&#10;upper floor and peered from the window out over the valley and the&#10;hills beyond; and there I saw the cause of their sudden scurrying to&#10;cover.  A huge craft, long, low, and gray-painted, swung slowly over&#10;the crest of the nearest hill.  Following it came another, and another,&#10;and another, until twenty of them, swinging low above the ground,&#10;sailed slowly and majestically toward us.&#10;&#10;Each carried a strange banner swung from stem to stern above the upper&#10;works, and upon the prow of each was painted some odd device that&#10;gleamed in the sunlight and showed plainly even at the distance at&#10;which we were from the vessels.  I could see figures crowding the&#10;forward decks and upper works of the air craft.  Whether they had&#10;discovered us or simply were looking at the deserted city I could not&#10;say, but in any event they received a rude reception, for suddenly and&#10;without warning the green Martian warriors fired a terrific volley from&#10;the windows of the buildings facing the little valley across which the&#10;great ships were so peacefully advancing.&#10;&#10;Instantly the scene changed as by magic; the foremost vessel swung&#10;broadside toward us, and bringing her guns into play returned our fire,&#10;at the same time moving parallel to our front for a short distance and&#10;then turning back with the evident intention of completing a great&#10;circle which would bring her up to position once more opposite our&#10;firing line; the other vessels followed in her wake, each one opening&#10;upon us as she swung into position.  Our own fire never diminished, and&#10;I doubt if twenty-five per cent of our shots went wild.  It had never&#10;been given me to see such deadly accuracy of aim, and it seemed as&#10;though a little figure on one of the craft dropped at the explosion of&#10;each bullet, while the banners and upper works dissolved in spurts of&#10;flame as the irresistible projectiles of our warriors mowed through&#10;them.&#10;&#10;The fire from the vessels was most ineffectual, owing, as I afterward&#10;learned, to the unexpected suddenness of the first volley, which caught&#10;the ship's crews entirely unprepared and the sighting apparatus of the&#10;guns unprotected from the deadly aim of our warriors.&#10;&#10;It seems that each green warrior has certain objective points for his&#10;fire under relatively identical circumstances of warfare.  For example,&#10;a proportion of them, always the best marksmen, direct their fire&#10;entirely upon the wireless finding and sighting apparatus of the big&#10;guns of an attacking naval force; another detail attends to the smaller&#10;guns in the same way; others pick off the gunners; still others the&#10;officers; while certain other quotas concentrate their attention upon&#10;the other members of the crew, upon the upper works, and upon the&#10;steering gear and propellers.&#10;&#10;Twenty minutes after the first volley the great fleet swung trailing&#10;off in the direction from which it had first appeared.  Several of the&#10;craft were limping perceptibly, and seemed but barely under the control&#10;of their depleted crews.  Their fire had ceased entirely and all their&#10;energies seemed focused upon escape.  Our warriors then rushed up to&#10;the roofs of the buildings which we occupied and followed the&#10;retreating armada with a continuous fusillade of deadly fire.&#10;&#10;One by one, however, the ships managed to dip below the crests of the&#10;outlying hills until only one barely moving craft was in sight.  This&#10;had received the brunt of our fire and seemed to be entirely unmanned,&#10;as not a moving figure was visible upon her decks.  Slowly she swung&#10;from her course, circling back toward us in an erratic and pitiful&#10;manner.  Instantly the warriors ceased firing, for it was quite&#10;apparent that the vessel was entirely helpless, and, far from being in&#10;a position to inflict harm upon us, she could not even control herself&#10;sufficiently to escape.&#10;&#10;As she neared the city the warriors rushed out upon the plain to meet&#10;her, but it was evident that she still was too high for them to hope to&#10;reach her decks.  From my vantage point in the window I could see the&#10;bodies of her crew strewn about, although I could not make out what&#10;manner of creatures they might be.  Not a sign of life was manifest&#10;upon her as she drifted slowly with the light breeze in a southeasterly&#10;direction.&#10;&#10;She was drifting some fifty feet above the ground, followed by all but&#10;some hundred of the warriors who had been ordered back to the roofs to&#10;cover the possibility of a return of the fleet, or of reinforcements.&#10;It soon became evident that she would strike the face of the buildings&#10;about a mile south of our position, and as I watched the progress of&#10;the chase I saw a number of warriors gallop ahead, dismount and enter&#10;the building she seemed destined to touch.&#10;&#10;As the craft neared the building, and just before she struck, the&#10;Martian warriors swarmed upon her from the windows, and with their&#10;great spears eased the shock of the collision, and in a few moments&#10;they had thrown out grappling hooks and the big boat was being hauled&#10;to ground by their fellows below.&#10;&#10;After making her fast, they swarmed the sides and searched the vessel&#10;from stem to stern.  I could see them examining the dead sailors,&#10;evidently for signs of life, and presently a party of them appeared&#10;from below dragging a little figure among them.  The creature was&#10;considerably less than half as tall as the green Martian warriors, and&#10;from my balcony I could see that it walked erect upon two legs and&#10;surmised that it was some new and strange Martian monstrosity with&#10;which I had not as yet become acquainted.&#10;&#10;They removed their prisoner to the ground and then commenced a&#10;systematic rifling of the vessel.  This operation required several&#10;hours, during which time a number of the chariots were requisitioned to&#10;transport the loot, which consisted in arms, ammunition, silks, furs,&#10;jewels, strangely carved stone vessels, and a quantity of solid foods&#10;and liquids, including many casks of water, the first I had seen since&#10;my advent upon Mars.&#10;&#10;After the last load had been removed the warriors made lines fast to&#10;the craft and towed her far out into the valley in a southwesterly&#10;direction.  A few of them then boarded her and were busily engaged in&#10;what appeared, from my distant position, as the emptying of the&#10;contents of various carboys upon the dead bodies of the sailors and&#10;over the decks and works of the vessel.&#10;&#10;This operation concluded, they hastily clambered over her sides,&#10;sliding down the guy ropes to the ground.  The last warrior to leave&#10;the deck turned and threw something back upon the vessel, waiting an&#10;instant to note the outcome of his act.  As a faint spurt of flame rose&#10;from the point where the missile struck he swung over the side and was&#10;quickly upon the ground.  Scarcely had he alighted than the guy ropes&#10;were simultaneously released, and the great warship, lightened by the&#10;removal of the loot, soared majestically into the air, her decks and&#10;upper works a mass of roaring flames.&#10;&#10;Slowly she drifted to the southeast, rising higher and higher as the&#10;flames ate away her wooden parts and diminished the weight upon her.&#10;Ascending to the roof of the building I watched her for hours, until&#10;finally she was lost in the dim vistas of the distance.  The sight was&#10;awe-inspiring in the extreme as one contemplated this mighty floating&#10;funeral pyre, drifting unguided and unmanned through the lonely wastes&#10;of the Martian heavens; a derelict of death and destruction, typifying&#10;the life story of these strange and ferocious creatures into whose&#10;unfriendly hands fate had carried it.&#10;&#10;Much depressed, and, to me, unaccountably so, I slowly descended to the&#10;street.  The scene I had witnessed seemed to mark the defeat and&#10;annihilation of the forces of a kindred people, rather than the routing&#10;by our green warriors of a horde of similar, though unfriendly,&#10;creatures.  I could not fathom the seeming hallucination, nor could I&#10;free myself from it; but somewhere in the innermost recesses of my soul&#10;I felt a strange yearning toward these unknown foemen, and a mighty&#10;hope surged through me that the fleet would return and demand a&#10;reckoning from the green warriors who had so ruthlessly and wantonly&#10;attacked it.&#10;&#10;Close at my heel, in his now accustomed place, followed Woola, the&#10;hound, and as I emerged upon the street Sola rushed up to me as though&#10;I had been the object of some search on her part.  The cavalcade was&#10;returning to the plaza, the homeward march having been given up for&#10;that day; nor, in fact, was it recommenced for more than a week, owing&#10;to the fear of a return attack by the air craft.&#10;&#10;Lorquas Ptomel was too astute an old warrior to be caught upon the open&#10;plains with a caravan of chariots and children, and so we remained at&#10;the deserted city until the danger seemed passed.&#10;&#10;As Sola and I entered the plaza a sight met my eyes which filled my&#10;whole being with a great surge of mingled hope, fear, exultation, and&#10;depression, and yet most dominant was a subtle sense of relief and&#10;happiness; for just as we neared the throng of Martians I caught a&#10;glimpse of the prisoner from the battle craft who was being roughly&#10;dragged into a nearby building by a couple of green Martian females.&#10;&#10;And the sight which met my eyes was that of a slender, girlish figure,&#10;similar in every detail to the earthly women of my past life.  She did&#10;not see me at first, but just as she was disappearing through the&#10;portal of the building which was to be her prison she turned, and her&#10;eyes met mine.  Her face was oval and beautiful in the extreme, her&#10;every feature was finely chiseled and exquisite, her eyes large and&#10;lustrous and her head surmounted by a mass of coal black, waving hair,&#10;caught loosely into a strange yet becoming coiffure.  Her skin was of a&#10;light reddish copper color, against which the crimson glow of her&#10;cheeks and the ruby of her beautifully molded lips shone with a&#10;strangely enhancing effect.&#10;&#10;She was as destitute of clothes as the green Martians who accompanied&#10;her; indeed, save for her highly wrought ornaments she was entirely&#10;naked, nor could any apparel have enhanced the beauty of her perfect&#10;and symmetrical figure.&#10;&#10;As her gaze rested on me her eyes opened wide in astonishment, and she&#10;made a little sign with her free hand; a sign which I did not, of&#10;course, understand.  Just a moment we gazed upon each other, and then&#10;the look of hope and renewed courage which had glorified her face as&#10;she discovered me, faded into one of utter dejection, mingled with&#10;loathing and contempt.  I realized I had not answered her signal, and&#10;ignorant as I was of Martian customs, I intuitively felt that she had&#10;made an appeal for succor and protection which my unfortunate ignorance&#10;had prevented me from answering.  And then she was dragged out of my&#10;sight into the depths of the deserted edifice.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER IX&#10;&#10;I LEARN THE LANGUAGE&#10;&#10;&#10;As I came back to myself I glanced at Sola, who had witnessed this&#10;encounter and I was surprised to note a strange expression upon her&#10;usually expressionless countenance.  What her thoughts were I did not&#10;know, for as yet I had learned but little of the Martian tongue; enough&#10;only to suffice for my daily needs.&#10;&#10;As I reached the doorway of our building a strange surprise awaited me.&#10;A warrior approached bearing the arms, ornaments, and full&#10;accouterments of his kind.  These he presented to me with a few&#10;unintelligible words, and a bearing at once respectful and menacing.&#10;&#10;Later, Sola, with the aid of several of the other women, remodeled the&#10;trappings to fit my lesser proportions, and after they completed the&#10;work I went about garbed in all the panoply of war.&#10;&#10;From then on Sola instructed me in the mysteries of the various&#10;weapons, and with the Martian young I spent several hours each day&#10;practicing upon the plaza.  I was not yet proficient with all the&#10;weapons, but my great familiarity with similar earthly weapons made me&#10;an unusually apt pupil, and I progressed in a very satisfactory manner.&#10;&#10;The training of myself and the young Martians was conducted solely by&#10;the women, who not only attend to the education of the young in the&#10;arts of individual defense and offense, but are also the artisans who&#10;produce every manufactured article wrought by the green Martians.  They&#10;make the powder, the cartridges, the firearms; in fact everything of&#10;value is produced by the females.  In time of actual warfare they form&#10;a part of the reserves, and when the necessity arises fight with even&#10;greater intelligence and ferocity than the men.&#10;&#10;The men are trained in the higher branches of the art of war; in&#10;strategy and the maneuvering of large bodies of troops.  They make the&#10;laws as they are needed; a new law for each emergency.  They are&#10;unfettered by precedent in the administration of justice.  Customs have&#10;been handed down by ages of repetition, but the punishment for ignoring&#10;a custom is a matter for individual treatment by a jury of the&#10;culprit's peers, and I may say that justice seldom misses fire, but&#10;seems rather to rule in inverse ratio to the ascendency of law.  In one&#10;respect at least the Martians are a happy people; they have no lawyers.&#10;&#10;I did not see the prisoner again for several days subsequent to our&#10;first encounter, and then only to catch a fleeting glimpse of her as&#10;she was being conducted to the great audience chamber where I had had&#10;my first meeting with Lorquas Ptomel.  I could not but note the&#10;unnecessary harshness and brutality with which her guards treated her;&#10;so different from the almost maternal kindliness which Sola manifested&#10;toward me, and the respectful attitude of the few green Martians who&#10;took the trouble to notice me at all.&#10;&#10;I had observed on the two occasions when I had seen her that the&#10;prisoner exchanged words with her guards, and this convinced me that&#10;they spoke, or at least could make themselves understood by a common&#10;language.  With this added incentive I nearly drove Sola distracted by&#10;my importunities to hasten on my education and within a few more days I&#10;had mastered the Martian tongue sufficiently well to enable me to carry&#10;on a passable conversation and to fully understand practically all that&#10;I heard.&#10;&#10;At this time our sleeping quarters were occupied by three or four&#10;females and a couple of the recently hatched young, beside Sola and her&#10;youthful ward, myself, and Woola the hound.  After they had retired for&#10;the night it was customary for the adults to carry on a desultory&#10;conversation for a short time before lapsing into sleep, and now that I&#10;could understand their language I was always a keen listener, although&#10;I never proffered any remarks myself.&#10;&#10;On the night following the prisoner's visit to the audience chamber the&#10;conversation finally fell upon this subject, and I was all ears on the&#10;instant.  I had feared to question Sola relative to the beautiful&#10;captive, as I could not but recall the strange expression I had noted&#10;upon her face after my first encounter with the prisoner.  That it&#10;denoted jealousy I could not say, and yet, judging all things by&#10;mundane standards as I still did, I felt it safer to affect&#10;indifference in the matter until I learned more surely Sola's attitude&#10;toward the object of my solicitude.&#10;&#10;Sarkoja, one of the older women who shared our domicile, had been&#10;present at the audience as one of the captive's guards, and it was&#10;toward her the question turned.&#10;&#10;&quot;When,&quot; asked one of the women, &quot;will we enjoy the death throes of the&#10;red one? or does Lorquas Ptomel, Jed, intend holding her for ransom?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;They have decided to carry her with us back to Thark, and exhibit her&#10;last agonies at the great games before Tal Hajus,&quot; replied Sarkoja.&#10;&#10;&quot;What will be the manner of her going out?&quot; inquired Sola.  &quot;She is&#10;very small and very beautiful; I had hoped that they would hold her for&#10;ransom.&quot;&#10;&#10;Sarkoja and the other women grunted angrily at this evidence of&#10;weakness on the part of Sola.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is sad, Sola, that you were not born a million years ago,&quot; snapped&#10;Sarkoja, &quot;when all the hollows of the land were filled with water, and&#10;the peoples were as soft as the stuff they sailed upon.  In our day we&#10;have progressed to a point where such sentiments mark weakness and&#10;atavism.  It will not be well for you to permit Tars Tarkas to learn&#10;that you hold such degenerate sentiments, as I doubt that he would care&#10;to entrust such as you with the grave responsibilities of maternity.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I see nothing wrong with my expression of interest in this red woman,&quot;&#10;retorted Sola.  &quot;She has never harmed us, nor would she should we have&#10;fallen into her hands.  It is only the men of her kind who war upon us,&#10;and I have ever thought that their attitude toward us is but the&#10;reflection of ours toward them.  They live at peace with all their&#10;fellows, except when duty calls upon them to make war, while we are at&#10;peace with none; forever warring among our own kind as well as upon the&#10;red men, and even in our own communities the individuals fight amongst&#10;themselves.  Oh, it is one continual, awful period of bloodshed from&#10;the time we break the shell until we gladly embrace the bosom of the&#10;river of mystery, the dark and ancient Iss which carries us to an&#10;unknown, but at least no more frightful and terrible existence!&#10;Fortunate indeed is he who meets his end in an early death.  Say what&#10;you please to Tars Tarkas, he can mete out no worse fate to me than a&#10;continuation of the horrible existence we are forced to lead in this&#10;life.&quot;&#10;&#10;This wild outbreak on the part of Sola so greatly surprised and shocked&#10;the other women, that, after a few words of general reprimand, they all&#10;lapsed into silence and were soon asleep.  One thing the episode had&#10;accomplished was to assure me of Sola's friendliness toward the poor&#10;girl, and also to convince me that I had been extremely fortunate in&#10;falling into her hands rather than those of some of the other females.&#10;I knew that she was fond of me, and now that I had discovered that she&#10;hated cruelty and barbarity I was confident that I could depend upon&#10;her to aid me and the girl captive to escape, provided of course that&#10;such a thing was within the range of possibilities.&#10;&#10;I did not even know that there were any better conditions to escape to,&#10;but I was more than willing to take my chances among people fashioned&#10;after my own mold rather than to remain longer among the hideous and&#10;bloodthirsty green men of Mars.  But where to go, and how, was as much&#10;of a puzzle to me as the age-old search for the spring of eternal life&#10;has been to earthly men since the beginning of time.&#10;&#10;I decided that at the first opportunity I would take Sola into my&#10;confidence and openly ask her to aid me, and with this resolution&#10;strong upon me I turned among my silks and furs and slept the dreamless&#10;and refreshing sleep of Mars.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER X&#10;&#10;CHAMPION AND CHIEF&#10;&#10;&#10;Early the next morning I was astir.  Considerable freedom was allowed&#10;me, as Sola had informed me that so long as I did not attempt to leave&#10;the city I was free to go and come as I pleased.  She had warned me,&#10;however, against venturing forth unarmed, as this city, like all other&#10;deserted metropolises of an ancient Martian civilization, was peopled&#10;by the great white apes of my second day's adventure.&#10;&#10;In advising me that I must not leave the boundaries of the city Sola&#10;had explained that Woola would prevent this anyway should I attempt it,&#10;and she warned me most urgently not to arouse his fierce nature by&#10;ignoring his warnings should I venture too close to the forbidden&#10;territory.  His nature was such, she said, that he would bring me back&#10;into the city dead or alive should I persist in opposing him;&#10;&quot;preferably dead,&quot; she added.&#10;&#10;On this morning I had chosen a new street to explore when suddenly I&#10;found myself at the limits of the city.  Before me were low hills&#10;pierced by narrow and inviting ravines.  I longed to explore the&#10;country before me, and, like the pioneer stock from which I sprang, to&#10;view what the landscape beyond the encircling hills might disclose from&#10;the summits which shut out my view.&#10;&#10;It also occurred to me that this would prove an excellent opportunity&#10;to test the qualities of Woola.  I was convinced that the brute loved&#10;me; I had seen more evidences of affection in him than in any other&#10;Martian animal, man or beast, and I was sure that gratitude for the&#10;acts that had twice saved his life would more than outweigh his loyalty&#10;to the duty imposed upon him by cruel and loveless masters.&#10;&#10;As I approached the boundary line Woola ran anxiously before me, and&#10;thrust his body against my legs.  His expression was pleading rather&#10;than ferocious, nor did he bare his great tusks or utter his fearful&#10;guttural warnings.  Denied the friendship and companionship of my kind,&#10;I had developed considerable affection for Woola and Sola, for the&#10;normal earthly man must have some outlet for his natural affections,&#10;and so I decided upon an appeal to a like instinct in this great brute,&#10;sure that I would not be disappointed.&#10;&#10;I had never petted nor fondled him, but now I sat upon the ground and&#10;putting my arms around his heavy neck I stroked and coaxed him, talking&#10;in my newly acquired Martian tongue as I would have to my hound at&#10;home, as I would have talked to any other friend among the lower&#10;animals.  His response to my manifestation of affection was remarkable&#10;to a degree; he stretched his great mouth to its full width, baring the&#10;entire expanse of his upper rows of tusks and wrinkling his snout until&#10;his great eyes were almost hidden by the folds of flesh.  If you have&#10;ever seen a collie smile you may have some idea of Woola's facial&#10;distortion.&#10;&#10;He threw himself upon his back and fairly wallowed at my feet; jumped&#10;up and sprang upon me, rolling me upon the ground by his great weight;&#10;then wriggling and squirming around me like a playful puppy presenting&#10;its back for the petting it craves.  I could not resist the&#10;ludicrousness of the spectacle, and holding my sides I rocked back and&#10;forth in the first laughter which had passed my lips in many days; the&#10;first, in fact, since the morning Powell had left camp when his horse,&#10;long unused, had precipitately and unexpectedly bucked him off&#10;headforemost into a pot of frijoles.&#10;&#10;My laughter frightened Woola, his antics ceased and he crawled&#10;pitifully toward me, poking his ugly head far into my lap; and then I&#10;remembered what laughter signified on Mars--torture, suffering, death.&#10;Quieting myself, I rubbed the poor old fellow's head and back, talked&#10;to him for a few minutes, and then in an authoritative tone commanded&#10;him to follow me, and arising started for the hills.&#10;&#10;There was no further question of authority between us; Woola was my&#10;devoted slave from that moment hence, and I his only and undisputed&#10;master.  My walk to the hills occupied but a few minutes, and I found&#10;nothing of particular interest to reward me.  Numerous brilliantly&#10;colored and strangely formed wild flowers dotted the ravines and from&#10;the summit of the first hill I saw still other hills stretching off&#10;toward the north, and rising, one range above another, until lost in&#10;mountains of quite respectable dimensions; though I afterward found&#10;that only a few peaks on all Mars exceed four thousand feet in height;&#10;the suggestion of magnitude was merely relative.&#10;&#10;My morning's walk had been large with importance to me for it had&#10;resulted in a perfect understanding with Woola, upon whom Tars Tarkas&#10;relied for my safe keeping.  I now knew that while theoretically a&#10;prisoner I was virtually free, and I hastened to regain the city limits&#10;before the defection of Woola could be discovered by his erstwhile&#10;masters.  The adventure decided me never again to leave the limits of&#10;my prescribed stamping grounds until I was ready to venture forth for&#10;good and all, as it would certainly result in a curtailment of my&#10;liberties, as well as the probable death of Woola, were we to be&#10;discovered.&#10;&#10;On regaining the plaza I had my third glimpse of the captive girl.  She&#10;was standing with her guards before the entrance to the audience&#10;chamber, and as I approached she gave me one haughty glance and turned&#10;her back full upon me.  The act was so womanly, so earthly womanly,&#10;that though it stung my pride it also warmed my heart with a feeling of&#10;companionship; it was good to know that someone else on Mars beside&#10;myself had human instincts of a civilized order, even though the&#10;manifestation of them was so painful and mortifying.&#10;&#10;Had a green Martian woman desired to show dislike or contempt she&#10;would, in all likelihood, have done it with a sword thrust or a&#10;movement of her trigger finger; but as their sentiments are mostly&#10;atrophied it would have required a serious injury to have aroused such&#10;passions in them.  Sola, let me add, was an exception; I never saw her&#10;perform a cruel or uncouth act, or fail in uniform kindliness and good&#10;nature.  She was indeed, as her fellow Martian had said of her, an&#10;atavism; a dear and precious reversion to a former type of loved and&#10;loving ancestor.&#10;&#10;Seeing that the prisoner seemed the center of attraction I halted to&#10;view the proceedings.  I had not long to wait for presently Lorquas&#10;Ptomel and his retinue of chieftains approached the building and,&#10;signing the guards to follow with the prisoner entered the audience&#10;chamber.  Realizing that I was a somewhat favored character, and also&#10;convinced that the warriors did not know of my proficiency in their&#10;language, as I had plead with Sola to keep this a secret on the&#10;grounds that I did not wish to be forced to talk with the men until I&#10;had perfectly mastered the Martian tongue, I chanced an attempt to&#10;enter the audience chamber and listen to the proceedings.&#10;&#10;The council squatted upon the steps of the rostrum, while below them&#10;stood the prisoner and her two guards.  I saw that one of the women was&#10;Sarkoja, and thus understood how she had been present at the hearing of&#10;the preceding day, the results of which she had reported to the&#10;occupants of our dormitory last night.  Her attitude toward the captive&#10;was most harsh and brutal.  When she held her, she sunk her rudimentary&#10;nails into the poor girl's flesh, or twisted her arm in a most painful&#10;manner.  When it was necessary to move from one spot to another she&#10;either jerked her roughly, or pushed her headlong before her.  She&#10;seemed to be venting upon this poor defenseless creature all the&#10;hatred, cruelty, ferocity, and spite of her nine hundred years, backed&#10;by unguessable ages of fierce and brutal ancestors.&#10;&#10;The other woman was less cruel because she was entirely indifferent; if&#10;the prisoner had been left to her alone, and fortunately she was at&#10;night, she would have received no harsh treatment, nor, by the same&#10;token would she have received any attention at all.&#10;&#10;As Lorquas Ptomel raised his eyes to address the prisoner they fell on&#10;me and he turned to Tars Tarkas with a word, and gesture of impatience.&#10;Tars Tarkas made some reply which I could not catch, but which caused&#10;Lorquas Ptomel to smile; after which they paid no further attention to&#10;me.&#10;&#10;&quot;What is your name?&quot; asked Lorquas Ptomel, addressing the prisoner.&#10;&#10;&quot;Dejah Thoris, daughter of Mors Kajak of Helium.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And the nature of your expedition?&quot; he continued.&#10;&#10;&quot;It was a purely scientific research party sent out by my father's&#10;father, the Jeddak of Helium, to rechart the air currents, and to take&#10;atmospheric density tests,&quot; replied the fair prisoner, in a low,&#10;well-modulated voice.&#10;&#10;&quot;We were unprepared for battle,&quot; she continued, &quot;as we were on a&#10;peaceful mission, as our banners and the colors of our craft denoted.&#10;The work we were doing was as much in your interests as in ours, for&#10;you know full well that were it not for our labors and the fruits of&#10;our scientific operations there would not be enough air or water on&#10;Mars to support a single human life.  For ages we have maintained the&#10;air and water supply at practically the same point without an&#10;appreciable loss, and we have done this in the face of the brutal and&#10;ignorant interference of you green men.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, oh, why will you not learn to live in amity with your fellows?&#10;Must you ever go on down the ages to your final extinction but little&#10;above the plane of the dumb brutes that serve you!  A people without&#10;written language, without art, without homes, without love; the victims&#10;of eons of the horrible community idea.  Owning everything in common,&#10;even to your women and children, has resulted in your owning nothing in&#10;common.  You hate each other as you hate all else except yourselves.&#10;Come back to the ways of our common ancestors, come back to the light&#10;of kindliness and fellowship.  The way is open to you, you will find&#10;the hands of the red men stretched out to aid you.  Together we may do&#10;still more to regenerate our dying planet.  The granddaughter of the&#10;greatest and mightiest of the red jeddaks has asked you.  Will you&#10;come?&quot;&#10;&#10;Lorquas Ptomel and the warriors sat looking silently and intently at&#10;the young woman for several moments after she had ceased speaking.&#10;What was passing in their minds no man may know, but that they were&#10;moved I truly believe, and if one man high among them had been strong&#10;enough to rise above custom, that moment would have marked a new and&#10;mighty era for Mars.&#10;&#10;I saw Tars Tarkas rise to speak, and on his face was such an expression&#10;as I had never seen upon the countenance of a green Martian warrior.&#10;It bespoke an inward and mighty battle with self, with heredity, with&#10;age-old custom, and as he opened his mouth to speak, a look almost of&#10;benignity, of kindliness, momentarily lighted up his fierce and&#10;terrible countenance.&#10;&#10;What words of moment were to have fallen from his lips were never&#10;spoken, as just then a young warrior, evidently sensing the trend of&#10;thought among the older men, leaped down from the steps of the rostrum,&#10;and striking the frail captive a powerful blow across the face, which&#10;felled her to the floor, placed his foot upon her prostrate form and&#10;turning toward the assembled council broke into peals of horrid,&#10;mirthless laughter.&#10;&#10;For an instant I thought Tars Tarkas would strike him dead, nor did the&#10;aspect of Lorquas Ptomel augur any too favorably for the brute, but the&#10;mood passed, their old selves reasserted their ascendency, and they&#10;smiled.  It was portentous however that they did not laugh aloud, for&#10;the brute's act constituted a side-splitting witticism according to the&#10;ethics which rule green Martian humor.&#10;&#10;That I have taken moments to write down a part of what occurred as that&#10;blow fell does not signify that I remained inactive for any such length&#10;of time.  I think I must have sensed something of what was coming, for&#10;I realize now that I was crouched as for a spring as I saw the blow&#10;aimed at her beautiful, upturned, pleading face, and ere the hand&#10;descended I was halfway across the hall.&#10;&#10;Scarcely had his hideous laugh rang out but once, when I was upon him.&#10;The brute was twelve feet in height and armed to the teeth, but I&#10;believe that I could have accounted for the whole roomful in the&#10;terrific intensity of my rage.  Springing upward, I struck him full in&#10;the face as he turned at my warning cry and then as he drew his&#10;short-sword I drew mine and sprang up again upon his breast, hooking&#10;one leg over the butt of his pistol and grasping one of his huge tusks&#10;with my left hand while I delivered blow after blow upon his enormous&#10;chest.&#10;&#10;He could not use his short-sword to advantage because I was too close&#10;to him, nor could he draw his pistol, which he attempted to do in&#10;direct opposition to Martian custom which says that you may not fight a&#10;fellow warrior in private combat with any other than the weapon with&#10;which you are attacked.  In fact he could do nothing but make a wild&#10;and futile attempt to dislodge me.  With all his immense bulk he was&#10;little if any stronger than I, and it was but the matter of a moment or&#10;two before he sank, bleeding and lifeless, to the floor.&#10;&#10;Dejah Thoris had raised herself upon one elbow and was watching the&#10;battle with wide, staring eyes.  When I had regained my feet I raised&#10;her in my arms and bore her to one of the benches at the side of the&#10;room.&#10;&#10;Again no Martian interfered with me, and tearing a piece of silk from&#10;my cape I endeavored to staunch the flow of blood from her nostrils.  I&#10;was soon successful as her injuries amounted to little more than an&#10;ordinary nosebleed, and when she could speak she placed her hand upon&#10;my arm and looking up into my eyes, said:&#10;&#10;&quot;Why did you do it?  You who refused me even friendly recognition in&#10;the first hour of my peril!  And now you risk your life and kill one of&#10;your companions for my sake.  I cannot understand.  What strange manner&#10;of man are you, that you consort with the green men, though your form&#10;is that of my race, while your color is little darker than that of the&#10;white ape?  Tell me, are you human, or are you more than human?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is a strange tale,&quot; I replied, &quot;too long to attempt to tell you&#10;now, and one which I so much doubt the credibility of myself that I&#10;fear to hope that others will believe it.  Suffice it, for the present,&#10;that I am your friend, and, so far as our captors will permit, your&#10;protector and your servant.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then you too are a prisoner?  But why, then, those arms and the&#10;regalia of a Tharkian chieftain?  What is your name?  Where your&#10;country?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, Dejah Thoris, I too am a prisoner; my name is John Carter, and I&#10;claim Virginia, one of the United States of America, Earth, as my home;&#10;but why I am permitted to wear arms I do not know, nor was I aware that&#10;my regalia was that of a chieftain.&quot;&#10;&#10;We were interrupted at this juncture by the approach of one of the&#10;warriors, bearing arms, accoutrements and ornaments, and in a flash one&#10;of her questions was answered and a puzzle cleared up for me.  I saw&#10;that the body of my dead antagonist had been stripped, and I read in&#10;the menacing yet respectful attitude of the warrior who had brought me&#10;these trophies of the kill the same demeanor as that evinced by the&#10;other who had brought me my original equipment, and now for the first&#10;time I realized that my blow, on the occasion of my first battle in the&#10;audience chamber had resulted in the death of my adversary.&#10;&#10;The reason for the whole attitude displayed toward me was now apparent;&#10;I had won my spurs, so to speak, and in the crude justice, which always&#10;marks Martian dealings, and which, among other things, has caused me to&#10;call her the planet of paradoxes, I was accorded the honors due a&#10;conqueror; the trappings and the position of the man I killed.  In&#10;truth, I was a Martian chieftain, and this I learned later was the&#10;cause of my great freedom and my toleration in the audience chamber.&#10;&#10;As I had turned to receive the dead warrior's chattels I had noticed&#10;that Tars Tarkas and several others had pushed forward toward us, and&#10;the eyes of the former rested upon me in a most quizzical manner.&#10;Finally he addressed me:&#10;&#10;&quot;You speak the tongue of Barsoom quite readily for one who was deaf and&#10;dumb to us a few short days ago.  Where did you learn it, John Carter?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You, yourself, are responsible, Tars Tarkas,&quot; I replied, &quot;in that you&#10;furnished me with an instructress of remarkable ability; I have to&#10;thank Sola for my learning.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She has done well,&quot; he answered, &quot;but your education in other respects&#10;needs considerable polish.  Do you know what your unprecedented&#10;temerity would have cost you had you failed to kill either of the two&#10;chieftains whose metal you now wear?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I presume that that one whom I had failed to kill, would have killed&#10;me,&quot; I answered, smiling.&#10;&#10;&quot;No, you are wrong.  Only in the last extremity of self-defense would a&#10;Martian warrior kill a prisoner; we like to save them for other&#10;purposes,&quot; and his face bespoke possibilities that were not pleasant to&#10;dwell upon.&#10;&#10;&quot;But one thing can save you now,&quot; he continued.  &quot;Should you, in&#10;recognition of your remarkable valor, ferocity, and prowess, be&#10;considered by Tal Hajus as worthy of his service you may be taken into&#10;the community and become a full-fledged Tharkian.  Until we reach the&#10;headquarters of Tal Hajus it is the will of Lorquas Ptomel that you be&#10;accorded the respect your acts have earned you.  You will be treated by&#10;us as a Tharkian chieftain, but you must not forget that every chief&#10;who ranks you is responsible for your safe delivery to our mighty and&#10;most ferocious ruler.  I am done.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I hear you, Tars Tarkas,&quot; I answered.  &quot;As you know I am not of&#10;Barsoom; your ways are not my ways, and I can only act in the future as&#10;I have in the past, in accordance with the dictates of my conscience&#10;and guided by the standards of mine own people.  If you will leave me&#10;alone I will go in peace, but if not, let the individual Barsoomians&#10;with whom I must deal either respect my rights as a stranger among you,&#10;or take whatever consequences may befall.  Of one thing let us be sure,&#10;whatever may be your ultimate intentions toward this unfortunate young&#10;woman, whoever would offer her injury or insult in the future must&#10;figure on making a full accounting to me.  I understand that you&#10;belittle all sentiments of generosity and kindliness, but I do not, and&#10;I can convince your most doughty warrior that these characteristics are&#10;not incompatible with an ability to fight.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ordinarily I am not given to long speeches, nor ever before had I&#10;descended to bombast, but I had guessed at the keynote which would&#10;strike an answering chord in the breasts of the green Martians, nor was&#10;I wrong, for my harangue evidently deeply impressed them, and their&#10;attitude toward me thereafter was still further respectful.&#10;&#10;Tars Tarkas himself seemed pleased with my reply, but his only comment&#10;was more or less enigmatical--&quot;And I think I know Tal Hajus, Jeddak of&#10;Thark.&quot;&#10;&#10;I now turned my attention to Dejah Thoris, and assisting her to her&#10;feet I turned with her toward the exit, ignoring her hovering guardian&#10;harpies as well as the inquiring glances of the chieftains.  Was I not&#10;now a chieftain also!  Well, then, I would assume the responsibilities&#10;of one.  They did not molest us, and so Dejah Thoris, Princess of&#10;Helium, and John Carter, gentleman of Virginia, followed by the&#10;faithful Woola, passed through utter silence from the audience chamber&#10;of Lorquas Ptomel, Jed among the Tharks of Barsoom.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER XI&#10;&#10;WITH DEJAH THORIS&#10;&#10;&#10;As we reached the open the two female guards who had been detailed to&#10;watch over Dejah Thoris hurried up and made as though to assume custody&#10;of her once more.  The poor child shrank against me and I felt her two&#10;little hands fold tightly over my arm.  Waving the women away, I&#10;informed them that Sola would attend the captive hereafter, and I&#10;further warned Sarkoja that any more of her cruel attentions bestowed&#10;upon Dejah Thoris would result in Sarkoja's sudden and painful demise.&#10;&#10;My threat was unfortunate and resulted in more harm than good to Dejah&#10;Thoris, for, as I learned later, men do not kill women upon Mars, nor&#10;women, men.  So Sarkoja merely gave us an ugly look and departed to&#10;hatch up deviltries against us.&#10;&#10;I soon found Sola and explained to her that I wished her to guard Dejah&#10;Thoris as she had guarded me; that I wished her to find other quarters&#10;where they would not be molested by Sarkoja, and I finally informed her&#10;that I myself would take up my quarters among the men.&#10;&#10;Sola glanced at the accouterments which were carried in my hand and&#10;slung across my shoulder.&#10;&#10;&quot;You are a great chieftain now, John Carter,&quot; she said, &quot;and I must do&#10;your bidding, though indeed I am glad to do it under any circumstances.&#10;The man whose metal you carry was young, but he was a great warrior,&#10;and had by his promotions and kills won his way close to the rank of&#10;Tars Tarkas, who, as you know, is second to Lorquas Ptomel only.  You&#10;are eleventh, there are but ten chieftains in this community who rank&#10;you in prowess.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And if I should kill Lorquas Ptomel?&quot; I asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;You would be first, John Carter; but you may only win that honor by&#10;the will of the entire council that Lorquas Ptomel meet you in combat,&#10;or should he attack you, you may kill him in self-defense, and thus win&#10;first place.&quot;&#10;&#10;I laughed, and changed the subject.  I had no particular desire to kill&#10;Lorquas Ptomel, and less to be a jed among the Tharks.&#10;&#10;I accompanied Sola and Dejah Thoris in a search for new quarters, which&#10;we found in a building nearer the audience chamber and of far more&#10;pretentious architecture than our former habitation.  We also found in&#10;this building real sleeping apartments with ancient beds of highly&#10;wrought metal swinging from enormous gold chains depending from the&#10;marble ceilings.  The decoration of the walls was most elaborate, and,&#10;unlike the frescoes in the other buildings I had examined, portrayed&#10;many human figures in the compositions.  These were of people like&#10;myself, and of a much lighter color than Dejah Thoris.  They were clad&#10;in graceful, flowing robes, highly ornamented with metal and jewels,&#10;and their luxuriant hair was of a beautiful golden and reddish bronze.&#10;The men were beardless and only a few wore arms.  The scenes depicted&#10;for the most part, a fair-skinned, fair-haired people at play.&#10;&#10;Dejah Thoris clasped her hands with an exclamation of rapture as she&#10;gazed upon these magnificent works of art, wrought by a people long&#10;extinct; while Sola, on the other hand, apparently did not see them.&#10;&#10;We decided to use this room, on the second floor and overlooking the&#10;plaza, for Dejah Thoris and Sola, and another room adjoining and in the&#10;rear for the cooking and supplies.  I then dispatched Sola to bring the&#10;bedding and such food and utensils as she might need, telling her that&#10;I would guard Dejah Thoris until her return.&#10;&#10;As Sola departed Dejah Thoris turned to me with a faint smile.&#10;&#10;&quot;And whereto, then, would your prisoner escape should you leave her,&#10;unless it was to follow you and crave your protection, and ask your&#10;pardon for the cruel thoughts she has harbored against you these past&#10;few days?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You are right,&quot; I answered, &quot;there is no escape for either of us&#10;unless we go together.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I heard your challenge to the creature you call Tars Tarkas, and I&#10;think I understand your position among these people, but what I cannot&#10;fathom is your statement that you are not of Barsoom.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In the name of my first ancestor, then,&quot; she continued, &quot;where may you&#10;be from?  You are like unto my people, and yet so unlike.  You speak my&#10;language, and yet I heard you tell Tars Tarkas that you had but learned&#10;it recently.  All Barsoomians speak the same tongue from the ice-clad&#10;south to the ice-clad north, though their written languages differ.&#10;Only in the valley Dor, where the river Iss empties into the lost sea&#10;of Korus, is there supposed to be a different language spoken, and,&#10;except in the legends of our ancestors, there is no record of a&#10;Barsoomian returning up the river Iss, from the shores of Korus in the&#10;valley of Dor.  Do not tell me that you have thus returned!  They would&#10;kill you horribly anywhere upon the surface of Barsoom if that were&#10;true; tell me it is not!&quot;&#10;&#10;Her eyes were filled with a strange, weird light; her voice was&#10;pleading, and her little hands, reached up upon my breast, were pressed&#10;against me as though to wring a denial from my very heart.&#10;&#10;&quot;I do not know your customs, Dejah Thoris, but in my own Virginia a&#10;gentleman does not lie to save himself; I am not of Dor; I have never&#10;seen the mysterious Iss; the lost sea of Korus is still lost, so far as&#10;I am concerned.  Do you believe me?&quot;&#10;&#10;And then it struck me suddenly that I was very anxious that she should&#10;believe me.  It was not that I feared the results which would follow a&#10;general belief that I had returned from the Barsoomian heaven or hell,&#10;or whatever it was.  Why was it, then!  Why should I care what she&#10;thought?  I looked down at her; her beautiful face upturned, and her&#10;wonderful eyes opening up the very depth of her soul; and as my eyes&#10;met hers I knew why, and--I shuddered.&#10;&#10;A similar wave of feeling seemed to stir her; she drew away from me&#10;with a sigh, and with her earnest, beautiful face turned up to mine,&#10;she whispered: &quot;I believe you, John Carter; I do not know what a&#10;'gentleman' is, nor have I ever heard before of Virginia; but on&#10;Barsoom no man lies; if he does not wish to speak the truth he is&#10;silent.  Where is this Virginia, your country, John Carter?&quot; she asked,&#10;and it seemed that this fair name of my fair land had never sounded&#10;more beautiful than as it fell from those perfect lips on that far-gone&#10;day.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am of another world,&quot; I answered, &quot;the great planet Earth, which&#10;revolves about our common sun and next within the orbit of your&#10;Barsoom, which we know as Mars.  How I came here I cannot tell you, for&#10;I do not know; but here I am, and since my presence has permitted me to&#10;serve Dejah Thoris I am glad that I am here.&quot;&#10;&#10;She gazed at me with troubled eyes, long and questioningly.  That it&#10;was difficult to believe my statement I well knew, nor could I hope&#10;that she would do so however much I craved her confidence and respect.&#10;I would much rather not have told her anything of my antecedents, but&#10;no man could look into the depth of those eyes and refuse her slightest&#10;behest.&#10;&#10;Finally she smiled, and, rising, said: &quot;I shall have to believe even&#10;though I cannot understand.  I can readily perceive that you are not of&#10;the Barsoom of today; you are like us, yet different--but why should I&#10;trouble my poor head with such a problem, when my heart tells me that I&#10;believe because I wish to believe!&quot;&#10;&#10;It was good logic, good, earthly, feminine logic, and if it satisfied&#10;her I certainly could pick no flaws in it.  As a matter of fact it was&#10;about the only kind of logic that could be brought to bear upon my&#10;problem.  We fell into a general conversation then, asking and&#10;answering many questions on each side.  She was curious to learn of the&#10;customs of my people and displayed a remarkable knowledge of events on&#10;Earth.  When I questioned her closely on this seeming familiarity with&#10;earthly things she laughed, and cried out:&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, every school boy on Barsoom knows the geography, and much&#10;concerning the fauna and flora, as well as the history of your planet&#10;fully as well as of his own.  Can we not see everything which takes&#10;place upon Earth, as you call it; is it not hanging there in the&#10;heavens in plain sight?&quot;&#10;&#10;This baffled me, I must confess, fully as much as my statements had&#10;confounded her; and I told her so.  She then explained in general the&#10;instruments her people had used and been perfecting for ages, which&#10;permit them to throw upon a screen a perfect image of what is&#10;transpiring upon any planet and upon many of the stars.  These pictures&#10;are so perfect in detail that, when photographed and enlarged, objects&#10;no greater than a blade of grass may be distinctly recognized.  I&#10;afterward, in Helium, saw many of these pictures, as well as the&#10;instruments which produced them.&#10;&#10;&quot;If, then, you are so familiar with earthly things,&quot; I asked, &quot;why is&#10;it that you do not recognize me as identical with the inhabitants of&#10;that planet?&quot;&#10;&#10;She smiled again as one might in bored indulgence of a questioning&#10;child.&#10;&#10;&quot;Because, John Carter,&quot; she replied, &quot;nearly every planet and star&#10;having atmospheric conditions at all approaching those of Barsoom,&#10;shows forms of animal life almost identical with you and me; and,&#10;further, Earth men, almost without exception, cover their bodies with&#10;strange, unsightly pieces of cloth, and their heads with hideous&#10;contraptions the purpose of which we have been unable to conceive;&#10;while you, when found by the Tharkian warriors, were entirely&#10;undisfigured and unadorned.&#10;&#10;&quot;The fact that you wore no ornaments is a strong proof of your&#10;un-Barsoomian origin, while the absence of grotesque coverings might&#10;cause a doubt as to your earthliness.&quot;&#10;&#10;I then narrated the details of my departure from the Earth, explaining&#10;that my body there lay fully clothed in all the, to her, strange&#10;garments of mundane dwellers.  At this point Sola returned with our&#10;meager belongings and her young Martian protege, who, of course, would&#10;have to share the quarters with them.&#10;&#10;Sola asked us if we had had a visitor during her absence, and seemed&#10;much surprised when we answered in the negative.  It seemed that as she&#10;had mounted the approach to the upper floors where our quarters were&#10;located, she had met Sarkoja descending.  We decided that she must have&#10;been eavesdropping, but as we could recall nothing of importance that&#10;had passed between us we dismissed the matter as of little consequence,&#10;merely promising ourselves to be warned to the utmost caution in the&#10;future.&#10;&#10;Dejah Thoris and I then fell to examining the architecture and&#10;decorations of the beautiful chambers of the building we were&#10;occupying.  She told me that these people had presumably flourished&#10;over a hundred thousand years before.  They were the early progenitors&#10;of her race, but had mixed with the other great race of early Martians,&#10;who were very dark, almost black, and also with the reddish yellow race&#10;which had flourished at the same time.&#10;&#10;These three great divisions of the higher Martians had been forced into&#10;a mighty alliance as the drying up of the Martian seas had compelled&#10;them to seek the comparatively few and always diminishing fertile&#10;areas, and to defend themselves, under new conditions of life, against&#10;the wild hordes of green men.&#10;&#10;Ages of close relationship and intermarrying had resulted in the race&#10;of red men, of which Dejah Thoris was a fair and beautiful daughter.&#10;During the ages of hardships and incessant warring between their own&#10;various races, as well as with the green men, and before they had&#10;fitted themselves to the changed conditions, much of the high&#10;civilization and many of the arts of the fair-haired Martians had&#10;become lost; but the red race of today has reached a point where it&#10;feels that it has made up in new discoveries and in a more practical&#10;civilization for all that lies irretrievably buried with the ancient&#10;Barsoomians, beneath the countless intervening ages.&#10;&#10;These ancient Martians had been a highly cultivated and literary race,&#10;but during the vicissitudes of those trying centuries of readjustment&#10;to new conditions, not only did their advancement and production cease&#10;entirely, but practically all their archives, records, and literature&#10;were lost.&#10;&#10;Dejah Thoris related many interesting facts and legends concerning this&#10;lost race of noble and kindly people.  She said that the city in which&#10;we were camping was supposed to have been a center of commerce and&#10;culture known as Korad.  It had been built upon a beautiful, natural&#10;harbor, landlocked by magnificent hills.  The little valley on the west&#10;front of the city, she explained, was all that remained of the harbor,&#10;while the pass through the hills to the old sea bottom had been the&#10;channel through which the shipping passed up to the city's gates.&#10;&#10;The shores of the ancient seas were dotted with just such cities, and&#10;lesser ones, in diminishing numbers, were to be found converging toward&#10;the center of the oceans, as the people had found it necessary to&#10;follow the receding waters until necessity had forced upon them their&#10;ultimate salvation, the so-called Martian canals.&#10;&#10;We had been so engrossed in exploration of the building and in our&#10;conversation that it was late in the afternoon before we realized it.&#10;We were brought back to a realization of our present conditions by a&#10;messenger bearing a summons from Lorquas Ptomel directing me to appear&#10;before him forthwith.  Bidding Dejah Thoris and Sola farewell, and&#10;commanding Woola to remain on guard, I hastened to the audience&#10;chamber, where I found Lorquas Ptomel and Tars Tarkas seated upon the&#10;rostrum.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER XII&#10;&#10;A PRISONER WITH POWER&#10;&#10;&#10;As I entered and saluted, Lorquas Ptomel signaled me to advance, and,&#10;fixing his great, hideous eyes upon me, addressed me thus:&#10;&#10;&quot;You have been with us a few days, yet during that time you have by&#10;your prowess won a high position among us.  Be that as it may, you are&#10;not one of us; you owe us no allegiance.&#10;&#10;&quot;Your position is a peculiar one,&quot; he continued; &quot;you are a prisoner&#10;and yet you give commands which must be obeyed; you are an alien and&#10;yet you are a Tharkian chieftain; you are a midget and yet you can kill&#10;a mighty warrior with one blow of your fist.  And now you are reported&#10;to have been plotting to escape with another prisoner of another race;&#10;a prisoner who, from her own admission, half believes you are returned&#10;from the valley of Dor.  Either one of these accusations, if proved,&#10;would be sufficient grounds for your execution, but we are a just&#10;people and you shall have a trial on our return to Thark, if Tal Hajus&#10;so commands.&#10;&#10;&quot;But,&quot; he continued, in his fierce guttural tones, &quot;if you run off with&#10;the red girl it is I who shall have to account to Tal Hajus; it is I&#10;who shall have to face Tars Tarkas, and either demonstrate my right to&#10;command, or the metal from my dead carcass will go to a better man, for&#10;such is the custom of the Tharks.&#10;&#10;&quot;I have no quarrel with Tars Tarkas; together we rule supreme the&#10;greatest of the lesser communities among the green men; we do not wish&#10;to fight between ourselves; and so if you were dead, John Carter, I&#10;should be glad.  Under two conditions only, however, may you be killed&#10;by us without orders from Tal Hajus; in personal combat in&#10;self-defense, should you attack one of us, or were you apprehended in&#10;an attempt to escape.&#10;&#10;&quot;As a matter of justice I must warn you that we only await one of these&#10;two excuses for ridding ourselves of so great a responsibility.  The&#10;safe delivery of the red girl to Tal Hajus is of the greatest&#10;importance.  Not in a thousand years have the Tharks made such a&#10;capture; she is the granddaughter of the greatest of the red jeddaks,&#10;who is also our bitterest enemy.  I have spoken.  The red girl told us&#10;that we were without the softer sentiments of humanity, but we are a&#10;just and truthful race.  You may go.&quot;&#10;&#10;Turning, I left the audience chamber.  So this was the beginning of&#10;Sarkoja's persecution!  I knew that none other could be responsible for&#10;this report which had reached the ears of Lorquas Ptomel so quickly,&#10;and now I recalled those portions of our conversation which had touched&#10;upon escape and upon my origin.&#10;&#10;Sarkoja was at this time Tars Tarkas' oldest and most trusted female.&#10;As such she was a mighty power behind the throne, for no warrior had&#10;the confidence of Lorquas Ptomel to such an extent as did his ablest&#10;lieutenant, Tars Tarkas.&#10;&#10;However, instead of putting thoughts of possible escape from my mind,&#10;my audience with Lorquas Ptomel only served to center my every faculty&#10;on this subject.  Now, more than before, the absolute necessity for&#10;escape, in so far as Dejah Thoris was concerned, was impressed upon me,&#10;for I was convinced that some horrible fate awaited her at the&#10;headquarters of Tal Hajus.&#10;&#10;As described by Sola, this monster was the exaggerated personification&#10;of all the ages of cruelty, ferocity, and brutality from which he had&#10;descended.  Cold, cunning, calculating; he was, also, in marked&#10;contrast to most of his fellows, a slave to that brute passion which&#10;the waning demands for procreation upon their dying planet has almost&#10;stilled in the Martian breast.&#10;&#10;The thought that the divine Dejah Thoris might fall into the clutches&#10;of such an abysmal atavism started the cold sweat upon me.  Far better&#10;that we save friendly bullets for ourselves at the last moment, as did&#10;those brave frontier women of my lost land, who took their own lives&#10;rather than fall into the hands of the Indian braves.&#10;&#10;As I wandered about the plaza lost in my gloomy forebodings Tars Tarkas&#10;approached me on his way from the audience chamber.  His demeanor&#10;toward me was unchanged, and he greeted me as though we had not just&#10;parted a few moments before.&#10;&#10;&quot;Where are your quarters, John Carter?&quot; he asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;I have selected none,&quot; I replied.  &quot;It seemed best that I quartered&#10;either by myself or among the other warriors, and I was awaiting an&#10;opportunity to ask your advice.  As you know,&quot; and I smiled, &quot;I am not&#10;yet familiar with all the customs of the Tharks.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Come with me,&quot; he directed, and together we moved off across the plaza&#10;to a building which I was glad to see adjoined that occupied by Sola&#10;and her charges.&#10;&#10;&quot;My quarters are on the first floor of this building,&quot; he said, &quot;and&#10;the second floor also is fully occupied by warriors, but the third&#10;floor and the floors above are vacant; you may take your choice of&#10;these.&#10;&#10;&quot;I understand,&quot; he continued, &quot;that you have given up your woman to the&#10;red prisoner.  Well, as you have said, your ways are not our ways, but&#10;you can fight well enough to do about as you please, and so, if you&#10;wish to give your woman to a captive, it is your own affair; but as a&#10;chieftain you should have those to serve you, and in accordance with&#10;our customs you may select any or all the females from the retinues of&#10;the chieftains whose metal you now wear.&quot;&#10;&#10;I thanked him, but assured him that I could get along very nicely&#10;without assistance except in the matter of preparing food, and so he&#10;promised to send women to me for this purpose and also for the care of&#10;my arms and the manufacture of my ammunition, which he said would be&#10;necessary.  I suggested that they might also bring some of the sleeping&#10;silks and furs which belonged to me as spoils of combat, for the nights&#10;were cold and I had none of my own.&#10;&#10;He promised to do so, and departed.  Left alone, I ascended the winding&#10;corridor to the upper floors in search of suitable quarters.  The&#10;beauties of the other buildings were repeated in this, and, as usual, I&#10;was soon lost in a tour of investigation and discovery.&#10;&#10;I finally chose a front room on the third floor, because this brought&#10;me nearer to Dejah Thoris, whose apartment was on the second floor of&#10;the adjoining building, and it flashed upon me that I could rig up some&#10;means of communication whereby she might signal me in case she needed&#10;either my services or my protection.&#10;&#10;Adjoining my sleeping apartment were baths, dressing rooms, and other&#10;sleeping and living apartments, in all some ten rooms on this floor.&#10;The windows of the back rooms overlooked an enormous court, which&#10;formed the center of the square made by the buildings which faced the&#10;four contiguous streets, and which was now given over to the quartering&#10;of the various animals belonging to the warriors occupying the&#10;adjoining buildings.&#10;&#10;While the court was entirely overgrown with the yellow, moss-like&#10;vegetation which blankets practically the entire surface of Mars, yet&#10;numerous fountains, statuary, benches, and pergola-like contraptions&#10;bore witness to the beauty which the court must have presented in&#10;bygone times, when graced by the fair-haired, laughing people whom&#10;stern and unalterable cosmic laws had driven not only from their homes,&#10;but from all except the vague legends of their descendants.&#10;&#10;One could easily picture the gorgeous foliage of the luxuriant Martian&#10;vegetation which once filled this scene with life and color; the&#10;graceful figures of the beautiful women, the straight and handsome men;&#10;the happy frolicking children--all sunlight, happiness and peace.  It&#10;was difficult to realize that they had gone; down through ages of&#10;darkness, cruelty, and ignorance, until their hereditary instincts of&#10;culture and humanitarianism had risen ascendant once more in the final&#10;composite race which now is dominant upon Mars.&#10;&#10;My thoughts were cut short by the advent of several young females&#10;bearing loads of weapons, silks, furs, jewels, cooking utensils, and&#10;casks of food and drink, including considerable loot from the air&#10;craft.  All this, it seemed, had been the property of the two&#10;chieftains I had slain, and now, by the customs of the Tharks, it had&#10;become mine.  At my direction they placed the stuff in one of the back&#10;rooms, and then departed, only to return with a second load, which they&#10;advised me constituted the balance of my goods.  On the second trip&#10;they were accompanied by ten or fifteen other women and youths, who, it&#10;seemed, formed the retinues of the two chieftains.&#10;&#10;They were not their families, nor their wives, nor their servants; the&#10;relationship was peculiar, and so unlike anything known to us that it&#10;is most difficult to describe.  All property among the green Martians&#10;is owned in common by the community, except the personal weapons,&#10;ornaments and sleeping silks and furs of the individuals.  These alone&#10;can one claim undisputed right to, nor may he accumulate more of these&#10;than are required for his actual needs.  The surplus he holds merely as&#10;custodian, and it is passed on to the younger members of the community&#10;as necessity demands.&#10;&#10;The women and children of a man's retinue may be likened to a military&#10;unit for which he is responsible in various ways, as in matters of&#10;instruction, discipline, sustenance, and the exigencies of their&#10;continual roamings and their unending strife with other communities and&#10;with the red Martians.  His women are in no sense wives.  The green&#10;Martians use no word corresponding in meaning with this earthly word.&#10;Their mating is a matter of community interest solely, and is directed&#10;without reference to natural selection.  The council of chieftains of&#10;each community control the matter as surely as the owner of a Kentucky&#10;racing stud directs the scientific breeding of his stock for the&#10;improvement of the whole.&#10;&#10;In theory it may sound well, as is often the case with theories, but&#10;the results of ages of this unnatural practice, coupled with the&#10;community interest in the offspring being held paramount to that of the&#10;mother, is shown in the cold, cruel creatures, and their gloomy,&#10;loveless, mirthless existence.&#10;&#10;It is true that the green Martians are absolutely virtuous, both men&#10;and women, with the exception of such degenerates as Tal Hajus; but&#10;better far a finer balance of human characteristics even at the expense&#10;of a slight and occasional loss of chastity.&#10;&#10;Finding that I must assume responsibility for these creatures, whether&#10;I would or not, I made the best of it and directed them to find&#10;quarters on the upper floors, leaving the third floor to me.  One of&#10;the girls I charged with the duties of my simple cuisine, and directed&#10;the others to take up the various activities which had formerly&#10;constituted their vocations.  Thereafter I saw little of them, nor did&#10;I care to.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER XIII&#10;&#10;LOVE-MAKING ON MARS&#10;&#10;&#10;Following the battle with the air ships, the community remained within&#10;the city for several days, abandoning the homeward march until they&#10;could feel reasonably assured that the ships would not return; for to&#10;be caught on the open plains with a cavalcade of chariots and children&#10;was far from the desire of even so warlike a people as the green&#10;Martians.&#10;&#10;During our period of inactivity, Tars Tarkas had instructed me in many&#10;of the customs and arts of war familiar to the Tharks, including&#10;lessons in riding and guiding the great beasts which bore the warriors.&#10;These creatures, which are known as thoats, are as dangerous and&#10;vicious as their masters, but when once subdued are sufficiently&#10;tractable for the purposes of the green Martians.&#10;&#10;Two of these animals had fallen to me from the warriors whose metal I&#10;wore, and in a short time I could handle them quite as well as the&#10;native warriors.  The method was not at all complicated.  If the thoats&#10;did not respond with sufficient celerity to the telepathic instructions&#10;of their riders they were dealt a terrific blow between the ears with&#10;the butt of a pistol, and if they showed fight this treatment was&#10;continued until the brutes either were subdued, or had unseated their&#10;riders.&#10;&#10;In the latter case it became a life and death struggle between the man&#10;and the beast.  If the former were quick enough with his pistol he&#10;might live to ride again, though upon some other beast; if not, his&#10;torn and mangled body was gathered up by his women and burned in&#10;accordance with Tharkian custom.&#10;&#10;My experience with Woola determined me to attempt the experiment of&#10;kindness in my treatment of my thoats.  First I taught them that they&#10;could not unseat me, and even rapped them sharply between the ears to&#10;impress upon them my authority and mastery.  Then, by degrees, I won&#10;their confidence in much the same manner as I had adopted countless&#10;times with my many mundane mounts.  I was ever a good hand with&#10;animals, and by inclination, as well as because it brought more lasting&#10;and satisfactory results, I was always kind and humane in my dealings&#10;with the lower orders.  I could take a human life, if necessary, with&#10;far less compunction than that of a poor, unreasoning, irresponsible&#10;brute.&#10;&#10;In the course of a few days my thoats were the wonder of the entire&#10;community.  They would follow me like dogs, rubbing their great snouts&#10;against my body in awkward evidence of affection, and respond to my&#10;every command with an alacrity and docility which caused the Martian&#10;warriors to ascribe to me the possession of some earthly power unknown&#10;on Mars.&#10;&#10;&quot;How have you bewitched them?&quot; asked Tars Tarkas one afternoon, when he&#10;had seen me run my arm far between the great jaws of one of my thoats&#10;which had wedged a piece of stone between two of his teeth while&#10;feeding upon the moss-like vegetation within our court yard.&#10;&#10;&quot;By kindness,&quot; I replied.  &quot;You see, Tars Tarkas, the softer sentiments&#10;have their value, even to a warrior.  In the height of battle as well&#10;as upon the march I know that my thoats will obey my every command, and&#10;therefore my fighting efficiency is enhanced, and I am a better warrior&#10;for the reason that I am a kind master.  Your other warriors would find&#10;it to the advantage of themselves as well as of the community to adopt&#10;my methods in this respect.  Only a few days since you, yourself, told&#10;me that these great brutes, by the uncertainty of their tempers, often&#10;were the means of turning victory into defeat, since, at a crucial&#10;moment, they might elect to unseat and rend their riders.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Show me how you accomplish these results,&quot; was Tars Tarkas' only&#10;rejoinder.&#10;&#10;And so I explained as carefully as I could the entire method of&#10;training I had adopted with my beasts, and later he had me repeat it&#10;before Lorquas Ptomel and the assembled warriors.  That moment marked&#10;the beginning of a new existence for the poor thoats, and before I left&#10;the community of Lorquas Ptomel I had the satisfaction of observing a&#10;regiment of as tractable and docile mounts as one might care to see.&#10;The effect on the precision and celerity of the military movements was&#10;so remarkable that Lorquas Ptomel presented me with a massive anklet of&#10;gold from his own leg, as a sign of his appreciation of my service to&#10;the horde.&#10;&#10;On the seventh day following the battle with the air craft we again&#10;took up the march toward Thark, all probability of another attack being&#10;deemed remote by Lorquas Ptomel.&#10;&#10;During the days just preceding our departure I had seen but little of&#10;Dejah Thoris, as I had been kept very busy by Tars Tarkas with my&#10;lessons in the art of Martian warfare, as well as in the training of my&#10;thoats.  The few times I had visited her quarters she had been absent,&#10;walking upon the streets with Sola, or investigating the buildings in&#10;the near vicinity of the plaza.  I had warned them against venturing&#10;far from the plaza for fear of the great white apes, whose ferocity I&#10;was only too well acquainted with.  However, since Woola accompanied&#10;them on all their excursions, and as Sola was well armed, there was&#10;comparatively little cause for fear.&#10;&#10;On the evening before our departure I saw them approaching along one of&#10;the great avenues which lead into the plaza from the east.  I advanced&#10;to meet them, and telling Sola that I would take the responsibility for&#10;Dejah Thoris' safekeeping, I directed her to return to her quarters on&#10;some trivial errand.  I liked and trusted Sola, but for some reason I&#10;desired to be alone with Dejah Thoris, who represented to me all that I&#10;had left behind upon Earth in agreeable and congenial companionship.&#10;There seemed bonds of mutual interest between us as powerful as though&#10;we had been born under the same roof rather than upon different&#10;planets, hurtling through space some forty-eight million miles apart.&#10;&#10;That she shared my sentiments in this respect I was positive, for on my&#10;approach the look of pitiful hopelessness left her sweet countenance to&#10;be replaced by a smile of joyful welcome, as she placed her little&#10;right hand upon my left shoulder in true red Martian salute.&#10;&#10;&quot;Sarkoja told Sola that you had become a true Thark,&quot; she said, &quot;and&#10;that I would now see no more of you than of any of the other warriors.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Sarkoja is a liar of the first magnitude,&quot; I replied, &quot;notwithstanding&#10;the proud claim of the Tharks to absolute verity.&quot;&#10;&#10;Dejah Thoris laughed.&#10;&#10;&quot;I knew that even though you became a member of the community you would&#10;not cease to be my friend; 'A warrior may change his metal, but not his&#10;heart,' as the saying is upon Barsoom.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I think they have been trying to keep us apart,&quot; she continued, &quot;for&#10;whenever you have been off duty one of the older women of Tars Tarkas'&#10;retinue has always arranged to trump up some excuse to get Sola and me&#10;out of sight.  They have had me down in the pits below the buildings&#10;helping them mix their awful radium powder, and make their terrible&#10;projectiles.  You know that these have to be manufactured by artificial&#10;light, as exposure to sunlight always results in an explosion.  You&#10;have noticed that their bullets explode when they strike an object?&#10;Well, the opaque, outer coating is broken by the impact, exposing a&#10;glass cylinder, almost solid, in the forward end of which is a minute&#10;particle of radium powder.  The moment the sunlight, even though&#10;diffused, strikes this powder it explodes with a violence which nothing&#10;can withstand.  If you ever witness a night battle you will note the&#10;absence of these explosions, while the morning following the battle&#10;will be filled at sunrise with the sharp detonations of exploding&#10;missiles fired the preceding night.  As a rule, however, non-exploding&#10;projectiles are used at night.&quot;  [I have used the word radium in&#10;describing this powder because in the light of recent discoveries on&#10;Earth I believe it to be a mixture of which radium is the base.  In&#10;Captain Carter's manuscript it is mentioned always by the name used in&#10;the written language of Helium and is spelled in hieroglyphics which it&#10;would be difficult and useless to reproduce.]&#10;&#10;While I was much interested in Dejah Thoris' explanation of this&#10;wonderful adjunct to Martian warfare, I was more concerned by the&#10;immediate problem of their treatment of her.  That they were keeping&#10;her away from me was not a matter for surprise, but that they should&#10;subject her to dangerous and arduous labor filled me with rage.&#10;&#10;&quot;Have they ever subjected you to cruelty and ignominy, Dejah Thoris?&quot; I&#10;asked, feeling the hot blood of my fighting ancestors leap in my veins&#10;as I awaited her reply.&#10;&#10;&quot;Only in little ways, John Carter,&quot; she answered.  &quot;Nothing that can&#10;harm me outside my pride.  They know that I am the daughter of ten&#10;thousand jeddaks, that I trace my ancestry straight back without a&#10;break to the builder of the first great waterway, and they, who do not&#10;even know their own mothers, are jealous of me.  At heart they hate&#10;their horrid fates, and so wreak their poor spite on me who stand for&#10;everything they have not, and for all they most crave and never can&#10;attain.  Let us pity them, my chieftain, for even though we die at&#10;their hands we can afford them pity, since we are greater than they and&#10;they know it.&quot;&#10;&#10;Had I known the significance of those words &quot;my chieftain,&quot; as applied&#10;by a red Martian woman to a man, I should have had the surprise of my&#10;life, but I did not know at that time, nor for many months thereafter.&#10;Yes, I still had much to learn upon Barsoom.&#10;&#10;&quot;I presume it is the better part of wisdom that we bow to our fate with&#10;as good grace as possible, Dejah Thoris; but I hope, nevertheless, that&#10;I may be present the next time that any Martian, green, red, pink, or&#10;violet, has the temerity to even so much as frown on you, my princess.&quot;&#10;&#10;Dejah Thoris caught her breath at my last words, and gazed upon me with&#10;dilated eyes and quickening breath, and then, with an odd little laugh,&#10;which brought roguish dimples to the corners of her mouth, she shook&#10;her head and cried:&#10;&#10;&quot;What a child!  A great warrior and yet a stumbling little child.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What have I done now?&quot; I asked, in sore perplexity.&#10;&#10;&quot;Some day you shall know, John Carter, if we live; but I may not tell&#10;you.  And I, the daughter of Mors Kajak, son of Tardos Mors, have&#10;listened without anger,&quot; she soliloquized in conclusion.&#10;&#10;Then she broke out again into one of her gay, happy, laughing moods;&#10;joking with me on my prowess as a Thark warrior as contrasted with my&#10;soft heart and natural kindliness.&#10;&#10;&quot;I presume that should you accidentally wound an enemy you would take&#10;him home and nurse him back to health,&quot; she laughed.&#10;&#10;&quot;That is precisely what we do on Earth,&quot; I answered.  &quot;At least among&#10;civilized men.&quot;&#10;&#10;This made her laugh again.  She could not understand it, for, with all&#10;her tenderness and womanly sweetness, she was still a Martian, and to a&#10;Martian the only good enemy is a dead enemy; for every dead foeman&#10;means so much more to divide between those who live.&#10;&#10;I was very curious to know what I had said or done to cause her so much&#10;perturbation a moment before and so I continued to importune her to&#10;enlighten me.&#10;&#10;&quot;No,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;it is enough that you have said it and that I&#10;have listened.  And when you learn, John Carter, and if I be dead, as&#10;likely I shall be ere the further moon has circled Barsoom another&#10;twelve times, remember that I listened and that I--smiled.&quot;&#10;&#10;It was all Greek to me, but the more I begged her to explain the more&#10;positive became her denials of my request, and, so, in very&#10;hopelessness, I desisted.&#10;&#10;Day had now given away to night and as we wandered along the great&#10;avenue lighted by the two moons of Barsoom, and with Earth looking down&#10;upon us out of her luminous green eye, it seemed that we were alone in&#10;the universe, and I, at least, was content that it should be so.&#10;&#10;The chill of the Martian night was upon us, and removing my silks I&#10;threw them across the shoulders of Dejah Thoris.  As my arm rested for&#10;an instant upon her I felt a thrill pass through every fiber of my&#10;being such as contact with no other mortal had even produced; and it&#10;seemed to me that she had leaned slightly toward me, but of that I was&#10;not sure.  Only I knew that as my arm rested there across her shoulders&#10;longer than the act of adjusting the silk required she did not draw&#10;away, nor did she speak.  And so, in silence, we walked the surface of&#10;a dying world, but in the breast of one of us at least had been born&#10;that which is ever oldest, yet ever new.&#10;&#10;I loved Dejah Thoris.  The touch of my arm upon her naked shoulder had&#10;spoken to me in words I would not mistake, and I knew that I had loved&#10;her since the first moment that my eyes had met hers that first time in&#10;the plaza of the dead city of Korad.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER XIV&#10;&#10;A DUEL TO THE DEATH&#10;&#10;&#10;My first impulse was to tell her of my love, and then I thought of the&#10;helplessness of her position wherein I alone could lighten the burdens&#10;of her captivity, and protect her in my poor way against the thousands&#10;of hereditary enemies she must face upon our arrival at Thark.  I could&#10;not chance causing her additional pain or sorrow by declaring a love&#10;which, in all probability she did not return.  Should I be so&#10;indiscreet, her position would be even more unbearable than now, and&#10;the thought that she might feel that I was taking advantage of her&#10;helplessness, to influence her decision was the final argument which&#10;sealed my lips.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why are you so quiet, Dejah Thoris?&quot; I asked.  &quot;Possibly you would&#10;rather return to Sola and your quarters.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No,&quot; she murmured, &quot;I am happy here.  I do not know why it is that I&#10;should always be happy and contented when you, John Carter, a stranger,&#10;are with me; yet at such times it seems that I am safe and that, with&#10;you, I shall soon return to my father's court and feel his strong arms&#10;about me and my mother's tears and kisses on my cheek.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do people kiss, then, upon Barsoom?&quot; I asked, when she had explained&#10;the word she used, in answer to my inquiry as to its meaning.&#10;&#10;&quot;Parents, brothers, and sisters, yes; and,&quot; she added in a low,&#10;thoughtful tone, &quot;lovers.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And you, Dejah Thoris, have parents and brothers and sisters?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And a--lover?&quot;&#10;&#10;She was silent, nor could I venture to repeat the question.&#10;&#10;&quot;The man of Barsoom,&quot; she finally ventured, &quot;does not ask personal&#10;questions of women, except his mother, and the woman he has fought for&#10;and won.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But I have fought--&quot; I started, and then I wished my tongue had been&#10;cut from my mouth; for she turned even as I caught myself and ceased,&#10;and drawing my silks from her shoulder she held them out to me, and&#10;without a word, and with head held high, she moved with the carriage of&#10;the queen she was toward the plaza and the doorway of her quarters.&#10;&#10;I did not attempt to follow her, other than to see that she reached the&#10;building in safety, but, directing Woola to accompany her, I turned&#10;disconsolately and entered my own house.  I sat for hours cross-legged,&#10;and cross-tempered, upon my silks meditating upon the queer freaks&#10;chance plays upon us poor devils of mortals.&#10;&#10;So this was love!  I had escaped it for all the years I had roamed the&#10;five continents and their encircling seas; in spite of beautiful women&#10;and urging opportunity; in spite of a half-desire for love and a&#10;constant search for my ideal, it had remained for me to fall furiously&#10;and hopelessly in love with a creature from another world, of a species&#10;similar possibly, yet not identical with mine.  A woman who was hatched&#10;from an egg, and whose span of life might cover a thousand years; whose&#10;people had strange customs and ideas; a woman whose hopes, whose&#10;pleasures, whose standards of virtue and of right and wrong might vary&#10;as greatly from mine as did those of the green Martians.&#10;&#10;Yes, I was a fool, but I was in love, and though I was suffering the&#10;greatest misery I had ever known I would not have had it otherwise for&#10;all the riches of Barsoom.  Such is love, and such are lovers wherever&#10;love is known.&#10;&#10;To me, Dejah Thoris was all that was perfect; all that was virtuous and&#10;beautiful and noble and good.  I believed that from the bottom of my&#10;heart, from the depth of my soul on that night in Korad as I sat&#10;cross-legged upon my silks while the nearer moon of Barsoom raced&#10;through the western sky toward the horizon, and lighted up the gold and&#10;marble, and jeweled mosaics of my world-old chamber, and I believe it&#10;today as I sit at my desk in the little study overlooking the Hudson.&#10;Twenty years have intervened; for ten of them I lived and fought for&#10;Dejah Thoris and her people, and for ten I have lived upon her memory.&#10;&#10;The morning of our departure for Thark dawned clear and hot, as do all&#10;Martian mornings except for the six weeks when the snow melts at the&#10;poles.&#10;&#10;I sought out Dejah Thoris in the throng of departing chariots, but she&#10;turned her shoulder to me, and I could see the red blood mount to her&#10;cheek.  With the foolish inconsistency of love I held my peace when I&#10;might have pled ignorance of the nature of my offense, or at least the&#10;gravity of it, and so have effected, at worst, a half conciliation.&#10;&#10;[Illustration: I sought out Dejah Thoris in the throng of departing&#10;chariots.]&#10;&#10;My duty dictated that I must see that she was comfortable, and so I&#10;glanced into her chariot and rearranged her silks and furs.  In doing&#10;so I noted with horror that she was heavily chained by one ankle to the&#10;side of the vehicle.&#10;&#10;&quot;What does this mean?&quot; I cried, turning to Sola.&#10;&#10;&quot;Sarkoja thought it best,&quot; she answered, her face betokening her&#10;disapproval of the procedure.&#10;&#10;Examining the manacles I saw that they fastened with a massive spring&#10;lock.&#10;&#10;&quot;Where is the key, Sola?  Let me have it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Sarkoja wears it, John Carter,&quot; she answered.&#10;&#10;I turned without further word and sought out Tars Tarkas, to whom I&#10;vehemently objected to the unnecessary humiliations and cruelties, as&#10;they seemed to my lover's eyes, that were being heaped upon Dejah&#10;Thoris.&#10;&#10;&quot;John Carter,&quot; he answered, &quot;if ever you and Dejah Thoris escape the&#10;Tharks it will be upon this journey.  We know that you will not go&#10;without her.  You have shown yourself a mighty fighter, and we do not&#10;wish to manacle you, so we hold you both in the easiest way that will&#10;yet ensure security.  I have spoken.&quot;&#10;&#10;I saw the strength of his reasoning at a flash, and knew that it was&#10;futile to appeal from his decision, but I asked that the key be taken&#10;from Sarkoja and that she be directed to leave the prisoner alone in&#10;future.&#10;&#10;&quot;This much, Tars Tarkas, you may do for me in return for the friendship&#10;that, I must confess, I feel for you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Friendship?&quot; he replied.  &quot;There is no such thing, John Carter; but&#10;have your will.  I shall direct that Sarkoja cease to annoy the girl,&#10;and I myself will take the custody of the key.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Unless you wish me to assume the responsibility,&quot; I said, smiling.&#10;&#10;He looked at me long and earnestly before he spoke.&#10;&#10;&quot;Were you to give me your word that neither you nor Dejah Thoris would&#10;attempt to escape until after we have safely reached the court of Tal&#10;Hajus you might have the key and throw the chains into the river Iss.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It was better that you held the key, Tars Tarkas,&quot; I replied&#10;&#10;He smiled, and said no more, but that night as we were making camp I&#10;saw him unfasten Dejah Thoris' fetters himself.&#10;&#10;With all his cruel ferocity and coldness there was an undercurrent of&#10;something in Tars Tarkas which he seemed ever battling to subdue.&#10;Could it be a vestige of some human instinct come back from an ancient&#10;forbear to haunt him with the horror of his people's ways!&#10;&#10;As I was approaching Dejah Thoris' chariot I passed Sarkoja, and the&#10;black, venomous look she accorded me was the sweetest balm I had felt&#10;for many hours.  Lord, how she hated me!  It bristled from her so&#10;palpably that one might almost have cut it with a sword.&#10;&#10;A few moments later I saw her deep in conversation with a warrior named&#10;Zad; a big, hulking, powerful brute, but one who had never made a kill&#10;among his own chieftains, and so was still an _o mad_, or man with&#10;one name; he could win a second name only with the metal of some&#10;chieftain.  It was this custom which entitled me to the names of either&#10;of the chieftains I had killed; in fact, some of the warriors addressed&#10;me as Dotar Sojat, a combination of the surnames of the two warrior&#10;chieftains whose metal I had taken, or, in other words, whom I had&#10;slain in fair fight.&#10;&#10;As Sarkoja talked with Zad he cast occasional glances in my direction,&#10;while she seemed to be urging him very strongly to some action.  I paid&#10;little attention to it at the time, but the next day I had good reason&#10;to recall the circumstances, and at the same time gain a slight insight&#10;into the depths of Sarkoja's hatred and the lengths to which she was&#10;capable of going to wreak her horrid vengeance on me.&#10;&#10;Dejah Thoris would have none of me again on this evening, and though I&#10;spoke her name she neither replied, nor conceded by so much as the&#10;flutter of an eyelid that she realized my existence.  In my extremity I&#10;did what most other lovers would have done; I sought word from her&#10;through an intimate.  In this instance it was Sola whom I intercepted&#10;in another part of camp.&#10;&#10;&quot;What is the matter with Dejah Thoris?&quot; I blurted out at her.  &quot;Why&#10;will she not speak to me?&quot;&#10;&#10;Sola seemed puzzled herself, as though such strange actions on the part&#10;of two humans were quite beyond her, as indeed they were, poor child.&#10;&#10;&quot;She says you have angered her, and that is all she will say, except&#10;that she is the daughter of a jed and the granddaughter of a jeddak and&#10;she has been humiliated by a creature who could not polish the teeth of&#10;her grandmother's sorak.&quot;&#10;&#10;I pondered over this report for some time, finally asking, &quot;What might&#10;a sorak be, Sola?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A little animal about as big as my hand, which the red Martian women&#10;keep to play with,&quot; explained Sola.&#10;&#10;Not fit to polish the teeth of her grandmother's cat!  I must rank&#10;pretty low in the consideration of Dejah Thoris, I thought; but I could&#10;not help laughing at the strange figure of speech, so homely and in&#10;this respect so earthly.  It made me homesick, for it sounded very much&#10;like &quot;not fit to polish her shoes.&quot;  And then commenced a train of&#10;thought quite new to me.  I began to wonder what my people at home were&#10;doing.  I had not seen them for years.  There was a family of Carters&#10;in Virginia who claimed close relationship with me; I was supposed to&#10;be a great uncle, or something of the kind equally foolish.  I could&#10;pass anywhere for twenty-five to thirty years of age, and to be a great&#10;uncle always seemed the height of incongruity, for my thoughts and&#10;feelings were those of a boy.  There were two little kiddies in the&#10;Carter family whom I had loved and who had thought there was no one on&#10;Earth like Uncle Jack; I could see them just as plainly, as I stood&#10;there under the moonlit skies of Barsoom, and I longed for them as I&#10;had never longed for any mortals before.  By nature a wanderer, I had&#10;never known the true meaning of the word home, but the great hall of&#10;the Carters had always stood for all that the word did mean to me, and&#10;now my heart turned toward it from the cold and unfriendly peoples I&#10;had been thrown amongst.  For did not even Dejah Thoris despise me!  I&#10;was a low creature, so low in fact that I was not even fit to polish&#10;the teeth of her grandmother's cat; and then my saving sense of humor&#10;came to my rescue, and laughing I turned into my silks and furs and&#10;slept upon the moon-haunted ground the sleep of a tired and healthy&#10;fighting man.&#10;&#10;We broke camp the next day at an early hour and marched with only a&#10;single halt until just before dark.  Two incidents broke the&#10;tediousness of the march.  About noon we espied far to our right what&#10;was evidently an incubator, and Lorquas Ptomel directed Tars Tarkas to&#10;investigate it.  The latter took a dozen warriors, including myself,&#10;and we raced across the velvety carpeting of moss to the little&#10;enclosure.&#10;&#10;It was indeed an incubator, but the eggs were very small in comparison&#10;with those I had seen hatching in ours at the time of my arrival on&#10;Mars.&#10;&#10;Tars Tarkas dismounted and examined the enclosure minutely, finally&#10;announcing that it belonged to the green men of Warhoon and that the&#10;cement was scarcely dry where it had been walled up.&#10;&#10;&quot;They cannot be a day's march ahead of us,&quot; he exclaimed, the light of&#10;battle leaping to his fierce face.&#10;&#10;The work at the incubator was short indeed.  The warriors tore open the&#10;entrance and a couple of them, crawling in, soon demolished all the&#10;eggs with their short-swords.  Then remounting we dashed back to join&#10;the cavalcade.  During the ride I took occasion to ask Tars Tarkas if&#10;these Warhoons whose eggs we had destroyed were a smaller people than&#10;his Tharks.&#10;&#10;&quot;I noticed that their eggs were so much smaller than those I saw&#10;hatching in your incubator,&quot; I added.&#10;&#10;He explained that the eggs had just been placed there; but, like all&#10;green Martian eggs, they would grow during the five-year period of&#10;incubation until they obtained the size of those I had seen hatching on&#10;the day of my arrival on Barsoom.  This was indeed an interesting piece&#10;of information, for it had always seemed remarkable to me that the&#10;green Martian women, large as they were, could bring forth such&#10;enormous eggs as I had seen the four-foot infants emerging from.  As a&#10;matter of fact, the new-laid egg is but little larger than an ordinary&#10;goose egg, and as it does not commence to grow until subjected to the&#10;light of the sun the chieftains have little difficulty in transporting&#10;several hundreds of them at one time from the storage vaults to the&#10;incubators.&#10;&#10;Shortly after the incident of the Warhoon eggs we halted to rest the&#10;animals, and it was during this halt that the second of the day's&#10;interesting episodes occurred.  I was engaged in changing my riding&#10;cloths from one of my thoats to the other, for I divided the day's work&#10;between them, when Zad approached me, and without a word struck my&#10;animal a terrific blow with his long-sword.&#10;&#10;I did not need a manual of green Martian etiquette to know what reply&#10;to make, for, in fact, I was so wild with anger that I could scarcely&#10;refrain from drawing my pistol and shooting him down for the brute he&#10;was; but he stood waiting with drawn long-sword, and my only choice was&#10;to draw my own and meet him in fair fight with his choice of weapons or&#10;a lesser one.&#10;&#10;This latter alternative is always permissible, therefore I could have&#10;used my short-sword, my dagger, my hatchet, or my fists had I wished,&#10;and been entirely within my rights, but I could not use firearms or a&#10;spear while he held only his long-sword.&#10;&#10;I chose the same weapon he had drawn because I knew he prided himself&#10;upon his ability with it, and I wished, if I worsted him at all, to do&#10;it with his own weapon.  The fight that followed was a long one and&#10;delayed the resumption of the march for an hour.  The entire community&#10;surrounded us, leaving a clear space about one hundred feet in diameter&#10;for our battle.&#10;&#10;Zad first attempted to rush me down as a bull might a wolf, but I was&#10;much too quick for him, and each time I side-stepped his rushes he&#10;would go lunging past me, only to receive a nick from my sword upon his&#10;arm or back.  He was soon streaming blood from a half dozen minor&#10;wounds, but I could not obtain an opening to deliver an effective&#10;thrust.  Then he changed his tactics, and fighting warily and with&#10;extreme dexterity, he tried to do by science what he was unable to do&#10;by brute strength.  I must admit that he was a magnificent swordsman,&#10;and had it not been for my greater endurance and the remarkable agility&#10;the lesser gravitation of Mars lent me I might not have been able to&#10;put up the creditable fight I did against him.&#10;&#10;We circled for some time without doing much damage on either side; the&#10;long, straight, needle-like swords flashing in the sunlight, and&#10;ringing out upon the stillness as they crashed together with each&#10;effective parry.  Finally Zad, realizing that he was tiring more than&#10;I, evidently decided to close in and end the battle in a final blaze of&#10;glory for himself; just as he rushed me a blinding flash of light&#10;struck full in my eyes, so that I could not see his approach and could&#10;only leap blindly to one side in an effort to escape the mighty blade&#10;that it seemed I could already feel in my vitals.  I was only partially&#10;successful, as a sharp pain in my left shoulder attested, but in the&#10;sweep of my glance as I sought to again locate my adversary, a sight&#10;met my astonished gaze which paid me well for the wound the temporary&#10;blindness had caused me.  There, upon Dejah Thoris' chariot stood three&#10;figures, for the purpose evidently of witnessing the encounter above&#10;the heads of the intervening Tharks.  There were Dejah Thoris, Sola,&#10;and Sarkoja, and as my fleeting glance swept over them a little tableau&#10;was presented which will stand graven in my memory to the day of my&#10;death.&#10;&#10;As I looked, Dejah Thoris turned upon Sarkoja with the fury of a young&#10;tigress and struck something from her upraised hand; something which&#10;flashed in the sunlight as it spun to the ground.  Then I knew what had&#10;blinded me at that crucial moment of the fight, and how Sarkoja had&#10;found a way to kill me without herself delivering the final thrust.&#10;Another thing I saw, too, which almost lost my life for me then and&#10;there, for it took my mind for the fraction of an instant entirely from&#10;my antagonist; for, as Dejah Thoris struck the tiny mirror from her&#10;hand, Sarkoja, her face livid with hatred and baffled rage, whipped out&#10;her dagger and aimed a terrific blow at Dejah Thoris; and then Sola,&#10;our dear and faithful Sola, sprang between them; the last I saw was the&#10;great knife descending upon her shielding breast.&#10;&#10;My enemy had recovered from his thrust and was making it extremely&#10;interesting for me, so I reluctantly gave my attention to the work in&#10;hand, but my mind was not upon the battle.&#10;&#10;We rushed each other furiously time after time, 'til suddenly, feeling&#10;the sharp point of his sword at my breast in a thrust I could neither&#10;parry nor escape, I threw myself upon him with outstretched sword and&#10;with all the weight of my body, determined that I would not die alone&#10;if I could prevent it.  I felt the steel tear into my chest, all went&#10;black before me, my head whirled in dizziness, and I felt my knees&#10;giving beneath me.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER XV&#10;&#10;SOLA TELLS ME HER STORY&#10;&#10;&#10;When consciousness returned, and, as I soon learned, I was down but a&#10;moment, I sprang quickly to my feet searching for my sword, and there I&#10;found it, buried to the hilt in the green breast of Zad, who lay stone&#10;dead upon the ochre moss of the ancient sea bottom.  As I regained my&#10;full senses I found his weapon piercing my left breast, but only&#10;through the flesh and muscles which cover my ribs, entering near the&#10;center of my chest and coming out below the shoulder.  As I had lunged&#10;I had turned so that his sword merely passed beneath the muscles,&#10;inflicting a painful but not dangerous wound.&#10;&#10;Removing the blade from my body I also regained my own, and turning my&#10;back upon his ugly carcass, I moved, sick, sore, and disgusted, toward&#10;the chariots which bore my retinue and my belongings.  A murmur of&#10;Martian applause greeted me, but I cared not for it.&#10;&#10;Bleeding and weak I reached my women, who, accustomed to such&#10;happenings, dressed my wounds, applying the wonderful healing and&#10;remedial agents which make only the most instantaneous of death blows&#10;fatal.  Give a Martian woman a chance and death must take a back seat.&#10;They soon had me patched up so that, except for weakness from loss of&#10;blood and a little soreness around the wound, I suffered no great&#10;distress from this thrust which, under earthly treatment, undoubtedly&#10;would have put me flat on my back for days.&#10;&#10;As soon as they were through with me I hastened to the chariot of Dejah&#10;Thoris, where I found my poor Sola with her chest swathed in bandages,&#10;but apparently little the worse for her encounter with Sarkoja, whose&#10;dagger it seemed had struck the edge of one of Sola's metal breast&#10;ornaments and, thus deflected, had inflicted but a slight flesh wound.&#10;&#10;As I approached I found Dejah Thoris lying prone upon her silks and&#10;furs, her lithe form wracked with sobs.  She did not notice my&#10;presence, nor did she hear me speaking with Sola, who was standing a&#10;short distance from the vehicle.&#10;&#10;&quot;Is she injured?&quot; I asked of Sola, indicating Dejah Thoris by an&#10;inclination of my head.&#10;&#10;&quot;No,&quot; she answered, &quot;she thinks that you are dead.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And that her grandmother's cat may now have no one to polish its&#10;teeth?&quot; I queried, smiling.&#10;&#10;&quot;I think you wrong her, John Carter,&quot; said Sola.  &quot;I do not understand&#10;either her ways or yours, but I am sure the granddaughter of ten&#10;thousand jeddaks would never grieve like this over any who held but the&#10;highest claim upon her affections.  They are a proud race, but they are&#10;just, as are all Barsoomians, and you must have hurt or wronged her&#10;grievously that she will not admit your existence living, though she&#10;mourns you dead.&#10;&#10;&quot;Tears are a strange sight upon Barsoom,&quot; she continued, &quot;and so it is&#10;difficult for me to interpret them.  I have seen but two people weep in&#10;all my life, other than Dejah Thoris; one wept from sorrow, the other&#10;from baffled rage.  The first was my mother, years ago before they&#10;killed her; the other was Sarkoja, when they dragged her from me today.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Your mother!&quot; I exclaimed, &quot;but, Sola, you could not have known your&#10;mother, child.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But I did.  And my father also,&quot; she added.  &quot;If you would like to&#10;hear the strange and un-Barsoomian story come to the chariot tonight,&#10;John Carter, and I will tell you that of which I have never spoken in&#10;all my life before.  And now the signal has been given to resume the&#10;march, you must go.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I will come tonight, Sola,&quot; I promised.  &quot;Be sure to tell Dejah Thoris&#10;I am alive and well.  I shall not force myself upon her, and be sure&#10;that you do not let her know I saw her tears.  If she would speak with&#10;me I but await her command.&quot;&#10;&#10;Sola mounted the chariot, which was swinging into its place in line,&#10;and I hastened to my waiting thoat and galloped to my station beside&#10;Tars Tarkas at the rear of the column.&#10;&#10;We made a most imposing and awe-inspiring spectacle as we strung out&#10;across the yellow landscape; the two hundred and fifty ornate and&#10;brightly colored chariots, preceded by an advance guard of some two&#10;hundred mounted warriors and chieftains riding five abreast and one&#10;hundred yards apart, and followed by a like number in the same&#10;formation, with a score or more of flankers on either side; the fifty&#10;extra mastodons, or heavy draught animals, known as zitidars, and the&#10;five or six hundred extra thoats of the warriors running loose within&#10;the hollow square formed by the surrounding warriors.  The gleaming&#10;metal and jewels of the gorgeous ornaments of the men and women,&#10;duplicated in the trappings of the zitidars and thoats, and&#10;interspersed with the flashing colors of magnificent silks and furs and&#10;feathers, lent a barbaric splendor to the caravan which would have&#10;turned an East Indian potentate green with envy.&#10;&#10;The enormous broad tires of the chariots and the padded feet of the&#10;animals brought forth no sound from the moss-covered sea bottom; and so&#10;we moved in utter silence, like some huge phantasmagoria, except when&#10;the stillness was broken by the guttural growling of a goaded zitidar,&#10;or the squealing of fighting thoats.  The green Martians converse but&#10;little, and then usually in monosyllables, low and like the faint&#10;rumbling of distant thunder.&#10;&#10;We traversed a trackless waste of moss which, bending to the pressure&#10;of broad tire or padded foot, rose up again behind us, leaving no sign&#10;that we had passed.  We might indeed have been the wraiths of the&#10;departed dead upon the dead sea of that dying planet for all the sound&#10;or sign we made in passing.  It was the first march of a large body of&#10;men and animals I had ever witnessed which raised no dust and left no&#10;spoor; for there is no dust upon Mars except in the cultivated&#10;districts during the winter months, and even then the absence of high&#10;winds renders it almost unnoticeable.&#10;&#10;We camped that night at the foot of the hills we had been approaching&#10;for two days and which marked the southern boundary of this particular&#10;sea.  Our animals had been two days without drink, nor had they had&#10;water for nearly two months, not since shortly after leaving Thark;&#10;but, as Tars Tarkas explained to me, they require but little and can&#10;live almost indefinitely upon the moss which covers Barsoom, and which,&#10;he told me, holds in its tiny stems sufficient moisture to meet the&#10;limited demands of the animals.&#10;&#10;After partaking of my evening meal of cheese-like food and vegetable&#10;milk I sought out Sola, whom I found working by the light of a torch&#10;upon some of Tars Tarkas' trappings.  She looked up at my approach, her&#10;face lighting with pleasure and with welcome.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am glad you came,&quot; she said; &quot;Dejah Thoris sleeps and I am lonely.&#10;Mine own people do not care for me, John Carter; I am too unlike them.&#10;It is a sad fate, since I must live my life amongst them, and I often&#10;wish that I were a true green Martian woman, without love and without&#10;hope; but I have known love and so I am lost.&#10;&#10;&quot;I promised to tell you my story, or rather the story of my parents.&#10;From what I have learned of you and the ways of your people I am sure&#10;that the tale will not seem strange to you, but among green Martians it&#10;has no parallel within the memory of the oldest living Thark, nor do&#10;our legends hold many similar tales.&#10;&#10;&quot;My mother was rather small, in fact too small to be allowed the&#10;responsibilities of maternity, as our chieftains breed principally for&#10;size.  She was also less cold and cruel than most green Martian women,&#10;and caring little for their society, she often roamed the deserted&#10;avenues of Thark alone, or went and sat among the wild flowers that&#10;deck the nearby hills, thinking thoughts and wishing wishes which I&#10;believe I alone among Tharkian women today may understand, for am I not&#10;the child of my mother?&#10;&#10;&quot;And there among the hills she met a young warrior, whose duty it was&#10;to guard the feeding zitidars and thoats and see that they roamed not&#10;beyond the hills.  They spoke at first only of such things as interest&#10;a community of Tharks, but gradually, as they came to meet more often,&#10;and, as was now quite evident to both, no longer by chance, they talked&#10;about themselves, their likes, their ambitions and their hopes.  She&#10;trusted him and told him of the awful repugnance she felt for the&#10;cruelties of their kind, for the hideous, loveless lives they must ever&#10;lead, and then she waited for the storm of denunciation to break from&#10;his cold, hard lips; but instead he took her in his arms and kissed her.&#10;&#10;&quot;They kept their love a secret for six long years.  She, my mother, was&#10;of the retinue of the great Tal Hajus, while her lover was a simple&#10;warrior, wearing only his own metal.  Had their defection from the&#10;traditions of the Tharks been discovered both would have paid the&#10;penalty in the great arena before Tal Hajus and the assembled hordes.&#10;&#10;&quot;The egg from which I came was hidden beneath a great glass vessel upon&#10;the highest and most inaccessible of the partially ruined towers of&#10;ancient Thark.  Once each year my mother visited it for the five long&#10;years it lay there in the process of incubation.  She dared not come&#10;oftener, for in the mighty guilt of her conscience she feared that her&#10;every move was watched.  During this period my father gained great&#10;distinction as a warrior and had taken the metal from several&#10;chieftains.  His love for my mother had never diminished, and his own&#10;ambition in life was to reach a point where he might wrest the metal&#10;from Tal Hajus himself, and thus, as ruler of the Tharks, be free to&#10;claim her as his own, as well as, by the might of his power, protect&#10;the child which otherwise would be quickly dispatched should the truth&#10;become known.&#10;&#10;&quot;It was a wild dream, that of wresting the metal from Tal Hajus in five&#10;short years, but his advance was rapid, and he soon stood high in the&#10;councils of Thark.  But one day the chance was lost forever, in so far&#10;as it could come in time to save his loved ones, for he was ordered&#10;away upon a long expedition to the ice-clad south, to make war upon the&#10;natives there and despoil them of their furs, for such is the manner of&#10;the green Barsoomian; he does not labor for what he can wrest in battle&#10;from others.&#10;&#10;&quot;He was gone for four years, and when he returned all had been over for&#10;three; for about a year after his departure, and shortly before the&#10;time for the return of an expedition which had gone forth to fetch the&#10;fruits of a community incubator, the egg had hatched.  Thereafter my&#10;mother continued to keep me in the old tower, visiting me nightly and&#10;lavishing upon me the love the community life would have robbed us both&#10;of.  She hoped, upon the return of the expedition from the incubator,&#10;to mix me with the other young assigned to the quarters of Tal Hajus,&#10;and thus escape the fate which would surely follow discovery of her sin&#10;against the ancient traditions of the green men.&#10;&#10;&quot;She taught me rapidly the language and customs of my kind, and one&#10;night she told me the story I have told to you up to this point,&#10;impressing upon me the necessity for absolute secrecy and the great&#10;caution I must exercise after she had placed me with the other young&#10;Tharks to permit no one to guess that I was further advanced in&#10;education than they, nor by any sign to divulge in the presence of&#10;others my affection for her, or my knowledge of my parentage; and then&#10;drawing me close to her she whispered in my ear the name of my father.&#10;&#10;&quot;And then a light flashed out upon the darkness of the tower chamber,&#10;and there stood Sarkoja, her gleaming, baleful eyes fixed in a frenzy&#10;of loathing and contempt upon my mother.  The torrent of hatred and&#10;abuse she poured out upon her turned my young heart cold in terror.&#10;That she had heard the entire story was apparent, and that she had&#10;suspected something wrong from my mother's long nightly absences from&#10;her quarters accounted for her presence there on that fateful night.&#10;&#10;&quot;One thing she had not heard, nor did she know, the whispered name of&#10;my father.  This was apparent from her repeated demands upon my mother&#10;to disclose the name of her partner in sin, but no amount of abuse or&#10;threats could wring this from her, and to save me from needless torture&#10;she lied, for she told Sarkoja that she alone knew nor would she ever&#10;tell her child.&#10;&#10;&quot;With final imprecations, Sarkoja hastened away to Tal Hajus to report&#10;her discovery, and while she was gone my mother, wrapping me in the&#10;silks and furs of her night coverings, so that I was scarcely&#10;noticeable, descended to the streets and ran wildly away toward the&#10;outskirts of the city, in the direction which led to the far south, out&#10;toward the man whose protection she might not claim, but on whose face&#10;she wished to look once more before she died.&#10;&#10;&quot;As we neared the city's southern extremity a sound came to us from&#10;across the mossy flat, from the direction of the only pass through the&#10;hills which led to the gates, the pass by which caravans from either&#10;north or south or east or west would enter the city.  The sounds we&#10;heard were the squealing of thoats and the grumbling of zitidars, with&#10;the occasional clank of arms which announced the approach of a body of&#10;warriors.  The thought uppermost in her mind was that it was my father&#10;returned from his expedition, but the cunning of the Thark held her&#10;from headlong and precipitate flight to greet him.&#10;&#10;&quot;Retreating into the shadows of a doorway she awaited the coming of the&#10;cavalcade which shortly entered the avenue, breaking its formation and&#10;thronging the thoroughfare from wall to wall.  As the head of the&#10;procession passed us the lesser moon swung clear of the overhanging&#10;roofs and lit up the scene with all the brilliancy of her wondrous&#10;light.  My mother shrank further back into the friendly shadows, and&#10;from her hiding place saw that the expedition was not that of my&#10;father, but the returning caravan bearing the young Tharks.  Instantly&#10;her plan was formed, and as a great chariot swung close to our hiding&#10;place she slipped stealthily in upon the trailing tailboard, crouching&#10;low in the shadow of the high side, straining me to her bosom in a&#10;frenzy of love.&#10;&#10;&quot;She knew, what I did not, that never again after that night would she&#10;hold me to her breast, nor was it likely we would ever look upon each&#10;other's face again.  In the confusion of the plaza she mixed me with&#10;the other children, whose guardians during the journey were now free to&#10;relinquish their responsibility.  We were herded together into a great&#10;room, fed by women who had not accompanied the expedition, and the next&#10;day we were parceled out among the retinues of the chieftains.&#10;&#10;&quot;I never saw my mother after that night.  She was imprisoned by Tal&#10;Hajus, and every effort, including the most horrible and shameful&#10;torture, was brought to bear upon her to wring from her lips the name&#10;of my father; but she remained steadfast and loyal, dying at last&#10;amidst the laughter of Tal Hajus and his chieftains during some awful&#10;torture she was undergoing.&#10;&#10;&quot;I learned afterwards that she told them that she had killed me to save&#10;me from a like fate at their hands, and that she had thrown my body to&#10;the white apes.  Sarkoja alone disbelieved her, and I feel to this day&#10;that she suspects my true origin, but does not dare expose me, at the&#10;present, at all events, because she also guesses, I am sure, the&#10;identity of my father.&#10;&#10;&quot;When he returned from his expedition and learned the story of my&#10;mother's fate I was present as Tal Hajus told him; but never by the&#10;quiver of a muscle did he betray the slightest emotion; only he did not&#10;laugh as Tal Hajus gleefully described her death struggles.  From that&#10;moment on he was the cruelest of the cruel, and I am awaiting the day&#10;when he shall win the goal of his ambition, and feel the carcass of Tal&#10;Hajus beneath his foot, for I am as sure that he but waits the&#10;opportunity to wreak a terrible vengeance, and that his great love is&#10;as strong in his breast as when it first transfigured him nearly forty&#10;years ago, as I am that we sit here upon the edge of a world-old ocean&#10;while sensible people sleep, John Carter.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And your father, Sola, is he with us now?&quot; I asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied, &quot;but he does not know me for what I am, nor does he&#10;know who betrayed my mother to Tal Hajus.  I alone know my father's&#10;name, and only I and Tal Hajus and Sarkoja know that it was she who&#10;carried the tale that brought death and torture upon her he loved.&quot;&#10;&#10;We sat silent for a few moments, she wrapped in the gloomy thoughts of&#10;her terrible past, and I in pity for the poor creatures whom the&#10;heartless, senseless customs of their race had doomed to loveless lives&#10;of cruelty and of hate.  Presently she spoke.&#10;&#10;&quot;John Carter, if ever a real man walked the cold, dead bosom of Barsoom&#10;you are one.  I know that I can trust you, and because the knowledge&#10;may someday help you or him or Dejah Thoris or myself, I am going to&#10;tell you the name of my father, nor place any restrictions or&#10;conditions upon your tongue.  When the time comes, speak the truth if&#10;it seems best to you.  I trust you because I know that you are not&#10;cursed with the terrible trait of absolute and unswerving truthfulness,&#10;that you could lie like one of your own Virginia gentlemen if a lie&#10;would save others from sorrow or suffering.  My father's name is Tars&#10;Tarkas.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER XVI&#10;&#10;WE PLAN ESCAPE&#10;&#10;&#10;The remainder of our journey to Thark was uneventful.  We were twenty&#10;days upon the road, crossing two sea bottoms and passing through or&#10;around a number of ruined cities, mostly smaller than Korad.  Twice we&#10;crossed the famous Martian waterways, or canals, so-called by our&#10;earthly astronomers.  When we approached these points a warrior would&#10;be sent far ahead with a powerful field glass, and if no great body of&#10;red Martian troops was in sight we would advance as close as possible&#10;without chance of being seen and then camp until dark, when we would&#10;slowly approach the cultivated tract, and, locating one of the&#10;numerous, broad highways which cross these areas at regular intervals,&#10;creep silently and stealthily across to the arid lands upon the other&#10;side.  It required five hours to make one of these crossings without a&#10;single halt, and the other consumed the entire night, so that we were&#10;just leaving the confines of the high-walled fields when the sun broke&#10;out upon us.&#10;&#10;Crossing in the darkness, as we did, I was unable to see but little,&#10;except as the nearer moon, in her wild and ceaseless hurtling through&#10;the Barsoomian heavens, lit up little patches of the landscape from&#10;time to time, disclosing walled fields and low, rambling buildings,&#10;presenting much the appearance of earthly farms.  There were many&#10;trees, methodically arranged, and some of them were of enormous height;&#10;there were animals in some of the enclosures, and they announced their&#10;presence by terrified squealings and snortings as they scented our&#10;queer, wild beasts and wilder human beings.&#10;&#10;Only once did I perceive a human being, and that was at the&#10;intersection of our crossroad with the wide, white turnpike which cuts&#10;each cultivated district longitudinally at its exact center.  The&#10;fellow must have been sleeping beside the road, for, as I came abreast&#10;of him, he raised upon one elbow and after a single glance at the&#10;approaching caravan leaped shrieking to his feet and fled madly down&#10;the road, scaling a nearby wall with the agility of a scared cat.  The&#10;Tharks paid him not the slightest attention; they were not out upon the&#10;warpath, and the only sign that I had that they had seen him was a&#10;quickening of the pace of the caravan as we hastened toward the&#10;bordering desert which marked our entrance into the realm of Tal Hajus.&#10;&#10;Not once did I have speech with Dejah Thoris, as she sent no word to me&#10;that I would be welcome at her chariot, and my foolish pride kept me&#10;from making any advances.  I verily believe that a man's way with women&#10;is in inverse ratio to his prowess among men.  The weakling and the&#10;saphead have often great ability to charm the fair sex, while the&#10;fighting man who can face a thousand real dangers unafraid, sits hiding&#10;in the shadows like some frightened child.&#10;&#10;Just thirty days after my advent upon Barsoom we entered the ancient&#10;city of Thark, from whose long-forgotten people this horde of green men&#10;have stolen even their name.  The hordes of Thark number some thirty&#10;thousand souls, and are divided into twenty-five communities.  Each&#10;community has its own jed and lesser chieftains, but all are under the&#10;rule of Tal Hajus, Jeddak of Thark.  Five communities make their&#10;headquarters at the city of Thark, and the balance are scattered among&#10;other deserted cities of ancient Mars throughout the district claimed&#10;by Tal Hajus.&#10;&#10;We made our entry into the great central plaza early in the afternoon.&#10;There were no enthusiastic friendly greetings for the returned&#10;expedition.  Those who chanced to be in sight spoke the names of&#10;warriors or women with whom they came in direct contact, in the formal&#10;greeting of their kind, but when it was discovered that they brought&#10;two captives a greater interest was aroused, and Dejah Thoris and I&#10;were the centers of inquiring groups.&#10;&#10;We were soon assigned to new quarters, and the balance of the day was&#10;devoted to settling ourselves to the changed conditions.  My home now&#10;was upon an avenue leading into the plaza from the south, the main&#10;artery down which we had marched from the gates of the city.  I was at&#10;the far end of the square and had an entire building to myself.  The&#10;same grandeur of architecture which was so noticeable a characteristic&#10;of Korad was in evidence here, only, if that were possible, on a larger&#10;and richer scale.  My quarters would have been suitable for housing the&#10;greatest of earthly emperors, but to these queer creatures nothing&#10;about a building appealed to them but its size and the enormity of its&#10;chambers; the larger the building, the more desirable; and so Tal Hajus&#10;occupied what must have been an enormous public building, the largest&#10;in the city, but entirely unfitted for residence purposes; the next&#10;largest was reserved for Lorquas Ptomel, the next for the jed of a&#10;lesser rank, and so on to the bottom of the list of five jeds.  The&#10;warriors occupied the buildings with the chieftains to whose retinues&#10;they belonged; or, if they preferred, sought shelter among any of the&#10;thousands of untenanted buildings in their own quarter of town; each&#10;community being assigned a certain section of the city.  The selection&#10;of building had to be made in accordance with these divisions, except&#10;in so far as the jeds were concerned, they all occupying edifices which&#10;fronted upon the plaza.&#10;&#10;When I had finally put my house in order, or rather seen that it had&#10;been done, it was nearing sunset, and I hastened out with the intention&#10;of locating Sola and her charges, as I had determined upon having&#10;speech with Dejah Thoris and trying to impress on her the necessity of&#10;our at least patching up a truce until I could find some way of aiding&#10;her to escape.  I searched in vain until the upper rim of the great red&#10;sun was just disappearing behind the horizon and then I spied the ugly&#10;head of Woola peering from a second-story window on the opposite side&#10;of the very street where I was quartered, but nearer the plaza.&#10;&#10;Without waiting for a further invitation I bolted up the winding runway&#10;which led to the second floor, and entering a great chamber at the&#10;front of the building was greeted by the frenzied Woola, who threw his&#10;great carcass upon me, nearly hurling me to the floor; the poor old&#10;fellow was so glad to see me that I thought he would devour me, his&#10;head split from ear to ear, showing his three rows of tusks in his&#10;hobgoblin smile.&#10;&#10;Quieting him with a word of command and a caress, I looked hurriedly&#10;through the approaching gloom for a sign of Dejah Thoris, and then, not&#10;seeing her, I called her name.  There was an answering murmur from the&#10;far corner of the apartment, and with a couple of quick strides I was&#10;standing beside her where she crouched among the furs and silks upon an&#10;ancient carved wooden seat.  As I waited she rose to her full height&#10;and looking me straight in the eye said:&#10;&#10;&quot;What would Dotar Sojat, Thark, of Dejah Thoris his captive?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Dejah Thoris, I do not know how I have angered you.  It was furtherest&#10;from my desire to hurt or offend you, whom I had hoped to protect and&#10;comfort.  Have none of me if it is your will, but that you must aid me&#10;in effecting your escape, if such a thing be possible, is not my&#10;request, but my command.  When you are safe once more at your father's&#10;court you may do with me as you please, but from now on until that day&#10;I am your master, and you must obey and aid me.&quot;&#10;&#10;She looked at me long and earnestly and I thought that she was&#10;softening toward me.&#10;&#10;&quot;I understand your words, Dotar Sojat,&quot; she replied, &quot;but you I do not&#10;understand.  You are a queer mixture of child and man, of brute and&#10;noble.  I only wish that I might read your heart.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Look down at your feet, Dejah Thoris; it lies there now where it has&#10;lain since that other night at Korad, and where it will ever lie&#10;beating alone for you until death stills it forever.&quot;&#10;&#10;She took a little step toward me, her beautiful hands outstretched in a&#10;strange, groping gesture.&#10;&#10;&quot;What do you mean, John Carter?&quot; she whispered.  &quot;What are you saying&#10;to me?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am saying what I had promised myself that I would not say to you, at&#10;least until you were no longer a captive among the green men; what from&#10;your attitude toward me for the past twenty days I had thought never to&#10;say to you; I am saying, Dejah Thoris, that I am yours, body and soul,&#10;to serve you, to fight for you, and to die for you.  Only one thing I&#10;ask of you in return, and that is that you make no sign, either of&#10;condemnation or of approbation of my words until you are safe among&#10;your own people, and that whatever sentiments you harbor toward me they&#10;be not influenced or colored by gratitude; whatever I may do to serve&#10;you will be prompted solely from selfish motives, since it gives me&#10;more pleasure to serve you than not.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I will respect your wishes, John Carter, because I understand the&#10;motives which prompt them, and I accept your service no more willingly&#10;than I bow to your authority; your word shall be my law.  I have twice&#10;wronged you in my thoughts and again I ask your forgiveness.&quot;&#10;&#10;Further conversation of a personal nature was prevented by the entrance&#10;of Sola, who was much agitated and wholly unlike her usual calm and&#10;possessed self.&#10;&#10;&quot;That horrible Sarkoja has been before Tal Hajus,&quot; she cried, &quot;and from&#10;what I heard upon the plaza there is little hope for either of you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What do they say?&quot; inquired Dejah Thoris.&#10;&#10;&quot;That you will be thrown to the wild calots [dogs] in the great arena&#10;as soon as the hordes have assembled for the yearly games.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Sola,&quot; I said, &quot;you are a Thark, but you hate and loathe the customs&#10;of your people as much as we do.  Will you not accompany us in one&#10;supreme effort to escape?  I am sure that Dejah Thoris can offer you a&#10;home and protection among her people, and your fate can be no worse&#10;among them than it must ever be here.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; cried Dejah Thoris, &quot;come with us, Sola, you will be better off&#10;among the red men of Helium than you are here, and I can promise you&#10;not only a home with us, but the love and affection your nature craves&#10;and which must always be denied you by the customs of your own race.&#10;Come with us, Sola; we might go without you, but your fate would be&#10;terrible if they thought you had connived to aid us.  I know that even&#10;that fear would not tempt you to interfere in our escape, but we want&#10;you with us, we want you to come to a land of sunshine and happiness,&#10;amongst a people who know the meaning of love, of sympathy, and of&#10;gratitude.  Say that you will, Sola; tell me that you will.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The great waterway which leads to Helium is but fifty miles to the&#10;south,&quot; murmured Sola, half to herself; &quot;a swift thoat might make it in&#10;three hours; and then to Helium it is five hundred miles, most of the&#10;way through thinly settled districts.  They would know and they would&#10;follow us.  We might hide among the great trees for a time, but the&#10;chances are small indeed for escape.  They would follow us to the very&#10;gates of Helium, and they would take toll of life at every step; you do&#10;not know them.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Is there no other way we might reach Helium?&quot; I asked.  &quot;Can you not&#10;draw me a rough map of the country we must traverse, Dejah Thoris?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied, and taking a great diamond from her hair she drew&#10;upon the marble floor the first map of Barsoomian territory I had ever&#10;seen.  It was crisscrossed in every direction with long straight lines,&#10;sometimes running parallel and sometimes converging toward some great&#10;circle.  The lines, she said, were waterways; the circles, cities; and&#10;one far to the northwest of us she pointed out as Helium.  There were&#10;other cities closer, but she said she feared to enter many of them, as&#10;they were not all friendly toward Helium.&#10;&#10;[Illustration: She drew upon the marble floor the first map of the&#10;Barsoomian territory I had ever seen.]&#10;&#10;Finally, after studying the map carefully in the moonlight which now&#10;flooded the room, I pointed out a waterway far to the north of us which&#10;also seemed to lead to Helium.&#10;&#10;&quot;Does not this pierce your grandfather's territory?&quot; I asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered, &quot;but it is two hundred miles north of us; it is&#10;one of the waterways we crossed on the trip to Thark.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;They would never suspect that we would try for that distant waterway,&quot;&#10;I answered, &quot;and that is why I think that it is the best route for our&#10;escape.&quot;&#10;&#10;Sola agreed with me, and it was decided that we should leave Thark this&#10;same night; just as quickly, in fact, as I could find and saddle my&#10;thoats.  Sola was to ride one and Dejah Thoris and I the other; each of&#10;us carrying sufficient food and drink to last us for two days, since&#10;the animals could not be urged too rapidly for so long a distance.&#10;&#10;I directed Sola to proceed with Dejah Thoris along one of the less&#10;frequented avenues to the southern boundary of the city, where I would&#10;overtake them with the thoats as quickly as possible; then, leaving&#10;them to gather what food, silks, and furs we were to need, I slipped&#10;quietly to the rear of the first floor, and entered the courtyard,&#10;where our animals were moving restlessly about, as was their habit,&#10;before settling down for the night.&#10;&#10;In the shadows of the buildings and out beneath the radiance of the&#10;Martian moons moved the great herd of thoats and zitidars, the latter&#10;grunting their low gutturals and the former occasionally emitting the&#10;sharp squeal which denotes the almost habitual state of rage in which&#10;these creatures passed their existence.  They were quieter now, owing&#10;to the absence of man, but as they scented me they became more restless&#10;and their hideous noise increased.  It was risky business, this&#10;entering a paddock of thoats alone and at night; first, because their&#10;increasing noisiness might warn the nearby warriors that something was&#10;amiss, and also because for the slightest cause, or for no cause at all&#10;some great bull thoat might take it upon himself to lead a charge upon&#10;me.&#10;&#10;Having no desire to awaken their nasty tempers upon such a night as&#10;this, where so much depended upon secrecy and dispatch, I hugged the&#10;shadows of the buildings, ready at an instant's warning to leap into&#10;the safety of a nearby door or window.  Thus I moved silently to the&#10;great gates which opened upon the street at the back of the court, and&#10;as I neared the exit I called softly to my two animals.  How I thanked&#10;the kind providence which had given me the foresight to win the love&#10;and confidence of these wild dumb brutes, for presently from the far&#10;side of the court I saw two huge bulks forcing their way toward me&#10;through the surging mountains of flesh.&#10;&#10;They came quite close to me, rubbing their muzzles against my body and&#10;nosing for the bits of food it was always my practice to reward them&#10;with.  Opening the gates I ordered the two great beasts to pass out,&#10;and then slipping quietly after them I closed the portals behind me.&#10;&#10;I did not saddle or mount the animals there, but instead walked quietly&#10;in the shadows of the buildings toward an unfrequented avenue which led&#10;toward the point I had arranged to meet Dejah Thoris and Sola.  With&#10;the noiselessness of disembodied spirits we moved stealthily along the&#10;deserted streets, but not until we were within sight of the plain&#10;beyond the city did I commence to breathe freely.  I was sure that Sola&#10;and Dejah Thoris would find no difficulty in reaching our rendezvous&#10;undetected, but with my great thoats I was not so sure for myself, as&#10;it was quite unusual for warriors to leave the city after dark; in fact&#10;there was no place for them to go within any but a long ride.&#10;&#10;I reached the appointed meeting place safely, but as Dejah Thoris and&#10;Sola were not there I led my animals into the entrance hall of one of&#10;the large buildings.  Presuming that one of the other women of the same&#10;household may have come in to speak to Sola, and so delayed their&#10;departure, I did not feel any undue apprehension until nearly an hour&#10;had passed without a sign of them, and by the time another half hour&#10;had crawled away I was becoming filled with grave anxiety.  Then there&#10;broke upon the stillness of the night the sound of an approaching&#10;party, which, from the noise, I knew could be no fugitives creeping&#10;stealthily toward liberty.  Soon the party was near me, and from the&#10;black shadows of my entranceway I perceived a score of mounted&#10;warriors, who, in passing, dropped a dozen words that fetched my heart&#10;clean into the top of my head.&#10;&#10;&quot;He would likely have arranged to meet them just without the city, and&#10;so--&quot;  I heard no more, they had passed on; but it was enough.  Our&#10;plan had been discovered, and the chances for escape from now on to the&#10;fearful end would be small indeed.  My one hope now was to return&#10;undetected to the quarters of Dejah Thoris and learn what fate had&#10;overtaken her, but how to do it with these great monstrous thoats upon&#10;my hands, now that the city probably was aroused by the knowledge of my&#10;escape was a problem of no mean proportions.&#10;&#10;Suddenly an idea occurred to me, and acting on my knowledge of the&#10;construction of the buildings of these ancient Martian cities with a&#10;hollow court within the center of each square, I groped my way blindly&#10;through the dark chambers, calling the great thoats after me.  They had&#10;difficulty in negotiating some of the doorways, but as the buildings&#10;fronting the city's principal exposures were all designed upon a&#10;magnificent scale, they were able to wriggle through without sticking&#10;fast; and thus we finally made the inner court where I found, as I had&#10;expected, the usual carpet of moss-like vegetation which would prove&#10;their food and drink until I could return them to their own enclosure.&#10;That they would be as quiet and contented here as elsewhere I was&#10;confident, nor was there but the remotest possibility that they would&#10;be discovered, as the green men had no great desire to enter these&#10;outlying buildings, which were frequented by the only thing, I believe,&#10;which caused them the sensation of fear--the great white apes of&#10;Barsoom.&#10;&#10;Removing the saddle trappings, I hid them just within the rear doorway&#10;of the building through which we had entered the court, and, turning&#10;the beasts loose, quickly made my way across the court to the rear of&#10;the buildings upon the further side, and thence to the avenue beyond.&#10;Waiting in the doorway of the building until I was assured that no one&#10;was approaching, I hurried across to the opposite side and through the&#10;first doorway to the court beyond; thus, crossing through court after&#10;court with only the slight chance of detection which the necessary&#10;crossing of the avenues entailed, I made my way in safety to the&#10;courtyard in the rear of Dejah Thoris' quarters.&#10;&#10;Here, of course, I found the beasts of the warriors who quartered in&#10;the adjacent buildings, and the warriors themselves I might expect to&#10;meet within if I entered; but, fortunately for me, I had another and&#10;safer method of reaching the upper story where Dejah Thoris should be&#10;found, and, after first determining as nearly as possible which of the&#10;buildings she occupied, for I had never observed them before from the&#10;court side, I took advantage of my relatively great strength and&#10;agility and sprang upward until I grasped the sill of a second-story&#10;window which I thought to be in the rear of her apartment.  Drawing&#10;myself inside the room I moved stealthily toward the front of the&#10;building, and not until I had quite reached the doorway of her room was&#10;I made aware by voices that it was occupied.&#10;&#10;I did not rush headlong in, but listened without to assure myself that&#10;it was Dejah Thoris and that it was safe to venture within.  It was&#10;well indeed that I took this precaution, for the conversation I heard&#10;was in the low gutturals of men, and the words which finally came to me&#10;proved a most timely warning.  The speaker was a chieftain and he was&#10;giving orders to four of his warriors.&#10;&#10;&quot;And when he returns to this chamber,&quot; he was saying, &quot;as he surely&#10;will when he finds she does not meet him at the city's edge, you four&#10;are to spring upon him and disarm him.  It will require the combined&#10;strength of all of you to do it if the reports they bring back from&#10;Korad are correct.  When you have him fast bound bear him to the vaults&#10;beneath the jeddak's quarters and chain him securely where he may be&#10;found when Tal Hajus wishes him.  Allow him to speak with none, nor&#10;permit any other to enter this apartment before he comes.  There will&#10;be no danger of the girl returning, for by this time she is safe in the&#10;arms of Tal Hajus, and may all her ancestors have pity upon her, for&#10;Tal Hajus will have none; the great Sarkoja has done a noble night's&#10;work.  I go, and if you fail to capture him when he comes, I commend&#10;your carcasses to the cold bosom of Iss.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER XVII&#10;&#10;A COSTLY RECAPTURE&#10;&#10;&#10;As the speaker ceased he turned to leave the apartment by the door&#10;where I was standing, but I needed to wait no longer; I had heard&#10;enough to fill my soul with dread, and stealing quietly away I returned&#10;to the courtyard by the way I had come.  My plan of action was formed&#10;upon the instant, and crossing the square and the bordering avenue upon&#10;the opposite side I soon stood within the courtyard of Tal Hajus.&#10;&#10;The brilliantly lighted apartments of the first floor told me where&#10;first to seek, and advancing to the windows I peered within.  I soon&#10;discovered that my approach was not to be the easy thing I had hoped,&#10;for the rear rooms bordering the court were filled with warriors and&#10;women.  I then glanced up at the stories above, discovering that the&#10;third was apparently unlighted, and so decided to make my entrance to&#10;the building from that point.  It was the work of but a moment for me&#10;to reach the windows above, and soon I had drawn myself within the&#10;sheltering shadows of the unlighted third floor.&#10;&#10;Fortunately the room I had selected was untenanted, and creeping&#10;noiselessly to the corridor beyond I discovered a light in the&#10;apartments ahead of me.  Reaching what appeared to be a doorway I&#10;discovered that it was but an opening upon an immense inner chamber&#10;which towered from the first floor, two stories below me, to the&#10;dome-like roof of the building, high above my head.  The floor of this&#10;great circular hall was thronged with chieftains, warriors and women,&#10;and at one end was a great raised platform upon which squatted the most&#10;hideous beast I had ever put my eyes upon.  He had all the cold, hard,&#10;cruel, terrible features of the green warriors, but accentuated and&#10;debased by the animal passions to which he had given himself over for&#10;many years.  There was not a mark of dignity or pride upon his bestial&#10;countenance, while his enormous bulk spread itself out upon the&#10;platform where he squatted like some huge devil fish, his six limbs&#10;accentuating the similarity in a horrible and startling manner.&#10;&#10;But the sight that froze me with apprehension was that of Dejah Thoris&#10;and Sola standing there before him, and the fiendish leer of him as he&#10;let his great protruding eyes gloat upon the lines of her beautiful&#10;figure.  She was speaking, but I could not hear what she said, nor&#10;could I make out the low grumbling of his reply.  She stood there erect&#10;before him, her head high held, and even at the distance I was from&#10;them I could read the scorn and disgust upon her face as she let her&#10;haughty glance rest without sign of fear upon him.  She was indeed the&#10;proud daughter of a thousand jeddaks, every inch of her dear, precious&#10;little body; so small, so frail beside the towering warriors around&#10;her, but in her majesty dwarfing them into insignificance; she was the&#10;mightiest figure among them and I verily believe that they felt it.&#10;&#10;Presently Tal Hajus made a sign that the chamber be cleared, and that&#10;the prisoners be left alone before him.  Slowly the chieftains, the&#10;warriors and the women melted away into the shadows of the surrounding&#10;chambers, and Dejah Thoris and Sola stood alone before the jeddak of&#10;the Tharks.&#10;&#10;One chieftain alone had hesitated before departing; I saw him standing&#10;in the shadows of a mighty column, his fingers nervously toying with&#10;the hilt of his great-sword and his cruel eyes bent in implacable&#10;hatred upon Tal Hajus.  It was Tars Tarkas, and I could read his&#10;thoughts as they were an open book for the undisguised loathing upon&#10;his face.  He was thinking of that other woman who, forty years ago,&#10;had stood before this beast, and could I have spoken a word into his&#10;ear at that moment the reign of Tal Hajus would have been over; but&#10;finally he also strode from the room, not knowing that he left his own&#10;daughter at the mercy of the creature he most loathed.&#10;&#10;Tal Hajus arose, and I, half fearing, half anticipating his intentions,&#10;hurried to the winding runway which led to the floors below.  No one&#10;was near to intercept me, and I reached the main floor of the chamber&#10;unobserved, taking my station in the shadow of the same column that&#10;Tars Tarkas had but just deserted.  As I reached the floor Tal Hajus&#10;was speaking.&#10;&#10;&quot;Princess of Helium, I might wring a mighty ransom from your people&#10;would I but return you to them unharmed, but a thousand times rather&#10;would I watch that beautiful face writhe in the agony of torture; it&#10;shall be long drawn out, that I promise you; ten days of pleasure were&#10;all too short to show the love I harbor for your race.  The terrors of&#10;your death shall haunt the slumbers of the red men through all the ages&#10;to come; they will shudder in the shadows of the night as their fathers&#10;tell them of the awful vengeance of the green men; of the power and&#10;might and hate and cruelty of Tal Hajus.  But before the torture you&#10;shall be mine for one short hour, and word of that too shall go forth&#10;to Tardos Mors, Jeddak of Helium, your grandfather, that he may grovel&#10;upon the ground in the agony of his sorrow.  Tomorrow the torture will&#10;commence; tonight thou art Tal Hajus'; come!&quot;&#10;&#10;He sprang down from the platform and grasped her roughly by the arm,&#10;but scarcely had he touched her than I leaped between them.  My&#10;short-sword, sharp and gleaming was in my right hand; I could have&#10;plunged it into his putrid heart before he realized that I was upon&#10;him; but as I raised my arm to strike I thought of Tars Tarkas, and,&#10;with all my rage, with all my hatred, I could not rob him of that sweet&#10;moment for which he had lived and hoped all these long, weary years,&#10;and so, instead, I swung my good right fist full upon the point of his&#10;jaw.  Without a sound he slipped to the floor as one dead.&#10;&#10;In the same deathly silence I grasped Dejah Thoris by the hand, and&#10;motioning Sola to follow we sped noiselessly from the chamber and to&#10;the floor above.  Unseen we reached a rear window and with the straps&#10;and leather of my trappings I lowered, first Sola and then Dejah Thoris&#10;to the ground below.  Dropping lightly after them I drew them rapidly&#10;around the court in the shadows of the buildings, and thus we returned&#10;over the same course I had so recently followed from the distant&#10;boundary of the city.&#10;&#10;We finally came upon my thoats in the courtyard where I had left them,&#10;and placing the trappings upon them we hastened through the building to&#10;the avenue beyond.  Mounting, Sola upon one beast, and Dejah Thoris&#10;behind me upon the other, we rode from the city of Thark through the&#10;hills to the south.&#10;&#10;Instead of circling back around the city to the northwest and toward&#10;the nearest waterway which lay so short a distance from us, we turned&#10;to the northeast and struck out upon the mossy waste across which, for&#10;two hundred dangerous and weary miles, lay another main artery leading&#10;to Helium.&#10;&#10;No word was spoken until we had left the city far behind, but I could&#10;hear the quiet sobbing of Dejah Thoris as she clung to me with her dear&#10;head resting against my shoulder.&#10;&#10;&quot;If we make it, my chieftain, the debt of Helium will be a mighty one;&#10;greater than she can ever pay you; and should we not make it,&quot; she&#10;continued, &quot;the debt is no less, though Helium will never know, for you&#10;have saved the last of our line from worse than death.&quot;&#10;&#10;I did not answer, but instead reached to my side and pressed the little&#10;fingers of her I loved where they clung to me for support, and then, in&#10;unbroken silence, we sped over the yellow, moonlit moss; each of us&#10;occupied with his own thoughts.  For my part I could not be other than&#10;joyful had I tried, with Dejah Thoris' warm body pressed close to mine,&#10;and with all our unpassed danger my heart was singing as gaily as&#10;though we were already entering the gates of Helium.&#10;&#10;Our earlier plans had been so sadly upset that we now found ourselves&#10;without food or drink, and I alone was armed.  We therefore urged our&#10;beasts to a speed that must tell on them sorely before we could hope to&#10;sight the ending of the first stage of our journey.&#10;&#10;We rode all night and all the following day with only a few short&#10;rests.  On the second night both we and our animals were completely&#10;fagged, and so we lay down upon the moss and slept for some five or six&#10;hours, taking up the journey once more before daylight.  All the&#10;following day we rode, and when, late in the afternoon we had sighted&#10;no distant trees, the mark of the great waterways throughout all&#10;Barsoom, the terrible truth flashed upon us--we were lost.&#10;&#10;Evidently we had circled, but which way it was difficult to say, nor&#10;did it seem possible with the sun to guide us by day and the moons and&#10;stars by night.  At any rate no waterway was in sight, and the entire&#10;party was almost ready to drop from hunger, thirst and fatigue.  Far&#10;ahead of us and a trifle to the right we could distinguish the outlines&#10;of low mountains.  These we decided to attempt to reach in the hope&#10;that from some ridge we might discern the missing waterway.  Night fell&#10;upon us before we reached our goal, and, almost fainting from weariness&#10;and weakness, we lay down and slept.&#10;&#10;I was awakened early in the morning by some huge body pressing close to&#10;mine, and opening my eyes with a start I beheld my blessed old Woola&#10;snuggling close to me; the faithful brute had followed us across that&#10;trackless waste to share our fate, whatever it might be.  Putting my&#10;arms about his neck I pressed my cheek close to his, nor am I ashamed&#10;that I did it, nor of the tears that came to my eyes as I thought of&#10;his love for me.  Shortly after this Dejah Thoris and Sola awakened,&#10;and it was decided that we push on at once in an effort to gain the&#10;hills.&#10;&#10;We had gone scarcely a mile when I noticed that my thoat was commencing&#10;to stumble and stagger in a most pitiful manner, although we had not&#10;attempted to force them out of a walk since about noon of the preceding&#10;day.  Suddenly he lurched wildly to one side and pitched violently to&#10;the ground.  Dejah Thoris and I were thrown clear of him and fell upon&#10;the soft moss with scarcely a jar; but the poor beast was in a pitiable&#10;condition, not even being able to rise, although relieved of our&#10;weight.  Sola told me that the coolness of the night, when it fell,&#10;together with the rest would doubtless revive him, and so I decided not&#10;to kill him, as was my first intention, as I had thought it cruel to&#10;leave him alone there to die of hunger and thirst.  Relieving him of&#10;his trappings, which I flung down beside him, we left the poor fellow&#10;to his fate, and pushed on with the one thoat as best we could.  Sola&#10;and I walked, making Dejah Thoris ride, much against her will.  In this&#10;way we had progressed to within about a mile of the hills we were&#10;endeavoring to reach when Dejah Thoris, from her point of vantage upon&#10;the thoat, cried out that she saw a great party of mounted men filing&#10;down from a pass in the hills several miles away.  Sola and I both&#10;looked in the direction she indicated, and there, plainly discernible,&#10;were several hundred mounted warriors.  They seemed to be headed in a&#10;southwesterly direction, which would take them away from us.&#10;&#10;They doubtless were Thark warriors who had been sent out to capture us,&#10;and we breathed a great sigh of relief that they were traveling in the&#10;opposite direction.  Quickly lifting Dejah Thoris from the thoat, I&#10;commanded the animal to lie down and we three did the same, presenting&#10;as small an object as possible for fear of attracting the attention of&#10;the warriors toward us.&#10;&#10;We could see them as they filed out of the pass, just for an instant,&#10;before they were lost to view behind a friendly ridge; to us a most&#10;providential ridge; since, had they been in view for any great length&#10;of time, they scarcely could have failed to discover us.  As what&#10;proved to be the last warrior came into view from the pass, he halted&#10;and, to our consternation, threw his small but powerful fieldglass to&#10;his eye and scanned the sea bottom in all directions.  Evidently he was&#10;a chieftain, for in certain marching formations among the green men a&#10;chieftain brings up the extreme rear of the column.  As his glass swung&#10;toward us our hearts stopped in our breasts, and I could feel the cold&#10;sweat start from every pore in my body.&#10;&#10;Presently it swung full upon us and--stopped.  The tension on our&#10;nerves was near the breaking point, and I doubt if any of us breathed&#10;for the few moments he held us covered by his glass; and then he&#10;lowered it and we could see him shout a command to the warriors who had&#10;passed from our sight behind the ridge.  He did not wait for them to&#10;join him, however, instead he wheeled his thoat and came tearing madly&#10;in our direction.&#10;&#10;There was but one slight chance and that we must take quickly.  Raising&#10;my strange Martian rifle to my shoulder I sighted and touched the&#10;button which controlled the trigger; there was a sharp explosion as the&#10;missile reached its goal, and the charging chieftain pitched backward&#10;from his flying mount.&#10;&#10;Springing to my feet I urged the thoat to rise, and directed Sola to&#10;take Dejah Thoris with her upon him and make a mighty effort to reach&#10;the hills before the green warriors were upon us.  I knew that in the&#10;ravines and gullies they might find a temporary hiding place, and even&#10;though they died there of hunger and thirst it would be better so than&#10;that they fell into the hands of the Tharks.  Forcing my two revolvers&#10;upon them as a slight means of protection, and, as a last resort, as an&#10;escape for themselves from the horrid death which recapture would&#10;surely mean, I lifted Dejah Thoris in my arms and placed her upon the&#10;thoat behind Sola, who had already mounted at my command.&#10;&#10;&quot;Good-bye, my princess,&quot; I whispered, &quot;we may meet in Helium yet.  I&#10;have escaped from worse plights than this,&quot; and I tried to smile as I&#10;lied.&#10;&#10;&quot;What,&quot; she cried, &quot;are you not coming with us?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How may I, Dejah Thoris?  Someone must hold these fellows off for a&#10;while, and I can better escape them alone than could the three of us&#10;together.&quot;&#10;&#10;She sprang quickly from the thoat and, throwing her dear arms about my&#10;neck, turned to Sola, saying with quiet dignity: &quot;Fly, Sola!  Dejah&#10;Thoris remains to die with the man she loves.&quot;&#10;&#10;Those words are engraved upon my heart.  Ah, gladly would I give up my&#10;life a thousand times could I only hear them once again; but I could&#10;not then give even a second to the rapture of her sweet embrace, and&#10;pressing my lips to hers for the first time, I picked her up bodily and&#10;tossed her to her seat behind Sola again, commanding the latter in&#10;peremptory tones to hold her there by force, and then, slapping the&#10;thoat upon the flank, I saw them borne away; Dejah Thoris struggling to&#10;the last to free herself from Sola's grasp.&#10;&#10;Turning, I beheld the green warriors mounting the ridge and looking for&#10;their chieftain.  In a moment they saw him, and then me; but scarcely&#10;had they discovered me than I commenced firing, lying flat upon my&#10;belly in the moss.  I had an even hundred rounds in the magazine of my&#10;rifle, and another hundred in the belt at my back, and I kept up a&#10;continuous stream of fire until I saw all of the warriors who had been&#10;first to return from behind the ridge either dead or scurrying to cover.&#10;&#10;My respite was short-lived however, for soon the entire party,&#10;numbering some thousand men, came charging into view, racing madly&#10;toward me.  I fired until my rifle was empty and they were almost upon&#10;me, and then a glance showing me that Dejah Thoris and Sola had&#10;disappeared among the hills, I sprang up, throwing down my useless gun,&#10;and started away in the direction opposite to that taken by Sola and&#10;her charge.&#10;&#10;If ever Martians had an exhibition of jumping, it was granted those&#10;astonished warriors on that day long years ago, but while it led them&#10;away from Dejah Thoris it did not distract their attention from&#10;endeavoring to capture me.&#10;&#10;They raced wildly after me until, finally, my foot struck a projecting&#10;piece of quartz, and down I went sprawling upon the moss.  As I looked&#10;up they were upon me, and although I drew my long-sword in an attempt&#10;to sell my life as dearly as possible, it was soon over.  I reeled&#10;beneath their blows which fell upon me in perfect torrents; my head&#10;swam; all was black, and I went down beneath them to oblivion.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER XVIII&#10;&#10;CHAINED IN WARHOON&#10;&#10;&#10;It must have been several hours before I regained consciousness and I&#10;well remember the feeling of surprise which swept over me as I realized&#10;that I was not dead.&#10;&#10;I was lying among a pile of sleeping silks and furs in the corner of a&#10;small room in which were several green warriors, and bending over me&#10;was an ancient and ugly female.&#10;&#10;As I opened my eyes she turned to one of the warriors, saying,&#10;&#10;&quot;He will live, O Jed.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;'Tis well,&quot; replied the one so addressed, rising and approaching my&#10;couch, &quot;he should render rare sport for the great games.&quot;&#10;&#10;And now as my eyes fell upon him, I saw that he was no Thark, for his&#10;ornaments and metal were not of that horde.  He was a huge fellow,&#10;terribly scarred about the face and chest, and with one broken tusk and&#10;a missing ear.  Strapped on either breast were human skulls and&#10;depending from these a number of dried human hands.&#10;&#10;His reference to the great games of which I had heard so much while&#10;among the Tharks convinced me that I had but jumped from purgatory into&#10;gehenna.&#10;&#10;After a few more words with the female, during which she assured him&#10;that I was now fully fit to travel, the jed ordered that we mount and&#10;ride after the main column.&#10;&#10;I was strapped securely to as wild and unmanageable a thoat as I had&#10;ever seen, and, with a mounted warrior on either side to prevent the&#10;beast from bolting, we rode forth at a furious pace in pursuit of the&#10;column.  My wounds gave me but little pain, so wonderfully and rapidly&#10;had the applications and injections of the female exercised their&#10;therapeutic powers, and so deftly had she bound and plastered the&#10;injuries.&#10;&#10;Just before dark we reached the main body of troops shortly after they&#10;had made camp for the night.  I was immediately taken before the&#10;leader, who proved to be the jeddak of the hordes of Warhoon.&#10;&#10;Like the jed who had brought me, he was frightfully scarred, and also&#10;decorated with the breastplate of human skulls and dried dead hands&#10;which seemed to mark all the greater warriors among the Warhoons, as&#10;well as to indicate their awful ferocity, which greatly transcends even&#10;that of the Tharks.&#10;&#10;The jeddak, Bar Comas, who was comparatively young, was the object of&#10;the fierce and jealous hatred of his old lieutenant, Dak Kova, the jed&#10;who had captured me, and I could not but note the almost studied&#10;efforts which the latter made to affront his superior.&#10;&#10;He entirely omitted the usual formal salutation as we entered the&#10;presence of the jeddak, and as he pushed me roughly before the ruler he&#10;exclaimed in a loud and menacing voice.&#10;&#10;&quot;I have brought a strange creature wearing the metal of a Thark whom it&#10;is my pleasure to have battle with a wild thoat at the great games.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He will die as Bar Comas, your jeddak, sees fit, if at all,&quot; replied&#10;the young ruler, with emphasis and dignity.&#10;&#10;&quot;If at all?&quot; roared Dak Kova.  &quot;By the dead hands at my throat but he&#10;shall die, Bar Comas.  No maudlin weakness on your part shall save him.&#10;O, would that Warhoon were ruled by a real jeddak rather than by a&#10;water-hearted weakling from whom even old Dak Kova could tear the metal&#10;with his bare hands!&quot;&#10;&#10;Bar Comas eyed the defiant and insubordinate chieftain for an instant,&#10;his expression one of haughty, fearless contempt and hate, and then&#10;without drawing a weapon and without uttering a word he hurled himself&#10;at the throat of his defamer.&#10;&#10;I never before had seen two green Martian warriors battle with nature's&#10;weapons and the exhibition of animal ferocity which ensued was as&#10;fearful a thing as the most disordered imagination could picture.  They&#10;tore at each others' eyes and ears with their hands and with their&#10;gleaming tusks repeatedly slashed and gored until both were cut fairly&#10;to ribbons from head to foot.&#10;&#10;Bar Comas had much the better of the battle as he was stronger, quicker&#10;and more intelligent.  It soon seemed that the encounter was done&#10;saving only the final death thrust when Bar Comas slipped in breaking&#10;away from a clinch.  It was the one little opening that Dak Kova&#10;needed, and hurling himself at the body of his adversary he buried his&#10;single mighty tusk in Bar Comas' groin and with a last powerful effort&#10;ripped the young jeddak wide open the full length of his body, the&#10;great tusk finally wedging in the bones of Bar Comas' jaw.  Victor and&#10;vanquished rolled limp and lifeless upon the moss, a huge mass of torn&#10;and bloody flesh.&#10;&#10;Bar Comas was stone dead, and only the most herculean efforts on the&#10;part of Dak Kova's females saved him from the fate he deserved.  Three&#10;days later he walked without assistance to the body of Bar Comas which,&#10;by custom, had not been moved from where it fell, and placing his foot&#10;upon the neck of his erstwhile ruler he assumed the title of Jeddak of&#10;Warhoon.&#10;&#10;The dead jeddak's hands and head were removed to be added to the&#10;ornaments of his conqueror, and then his women cremated what remained,&#10;amid wild and terrible laughter.&#10;&#10;The injuries to Dak Kova had delayed the march so greatly that it was&#10;decided to give up the expedition, which was a raid upon a small Thark&#10;community in retaliation for the destruction of the incubator, until&#10;after the great games, and the entire body of warriors, ten thousand in&#10;number, turned back toward Warhoon.&#10;&#10;My introduction to these cruel and bloodthirsty people was but an index&#10;to the scenes I witnessed almost daily while with them.  They are a&#10;smaller horde than the Tharks but much more ferocious.  Not a day&#10;passed but that some members of the various Warhoon communities met in&#10;deadly combat.  I have seen as high as eight mortal duels within a&#10;single day.&#10;&#10;We reached the city of Warhoon after some three days march and I was&#10;immediately cast into a dungeon and heavily chained to the floor and&#10;walls.  Food was brought me at intervals but owing to the utter&#10;darkness of the place I do not know whether I lay there days, or weeks,&#10;or months.  It was the most horrible experience of all my life and that&#10;my mind did not give way to the terrors of that inky blackness has been&#10;a wonder to me ever since.  The place was filled with creeping,&#10;crawling things; cold, sinuous bodies passed over me when I lay down,&#10;and in the darkness I occasionally caught glimpses of gleaming, fiery&#10;eyes, fixed in horrible intentness upon me.  No sound reached me from&#10;the world above and no word would my jailer vouchsafe when my food was&#10;brought to me, although I at first bombarded him with questions.&#10;&#10;Finally all the hatred and maniacal loathing for these awful creatures&#10;who had placed me in this horrible place was centered by my tottering&#10;reason upon this single emissary who represented to me the entire horde&#10;of Warhoons.&#10;&#10;I had noticed that he always advanced with his dim torch to where he&#10;could place the food within my reach and as he stooped to place it upon&#10;the floor his head was about on a level with my breast.  So, with the&#10;cunning of a madman, I backed into the far corner of my cell when next&#10;I heard him approaching and gathering a little slack of the great chain&#10;which held me in my hand I waited his coming, crouching like some beast&#10;of prey.  As he stooped to place my food upon the ground I swung the&#10;chain above my head and crashed the links with all my strength upon his&#10;skull.  Without a sound he slipped to the floor, stone dead.&#10;&#10;Laughing and chattering like the idiot I was fast becoming I fell upon&#10;his prostrate form my fingers feeling for his dead throat.  Presently&#10;they came in contact with a small chain at the end of which dangled a&#10;number of keys.  The touch of my fingers on these keys brought back my&#10;reason with the suddenness of thought.  No longer was I a jibbering&#10;idiot, but a sane, reasoning man with the means of escape within my&#10;very hands.&#10;&#10;As I was groping to remove the chain from about my victim's neck I&#10;glanced up into the darkness to see six pairs of gleaming eyes fixed,&#10;unwinking, upon me.  Slowly they approached and slowly I shrank back&#10;from the awful horror of them.  Back into my corner I crouched holding&#10;my hands palms out, before me, and stealthily on came the awful eyes&#10;until they reached the dead body at my feet.  Then slowly they&#10;retreated but this time with a strange grating sound and finally they&#10;disappeared in some black and distant recess of my dungeon.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER XIX&#10;&#10;BATTLING IN THE ARENA&#10;&#10;&#10;Slowly I regained my composure and finally essayed again to attempt to&#10;remove the keys from the dead body of my former jailer.  But as I&#10;reached out into the darkness to locate it I found to my horror that it&#10;was gone.  Then the truth flashed on me; the owners of those gleaming&#10;eyes had dragged my prize away from me to be devoured in their&#10;neighboring lair; as they had been waiting for days, for weeks, for&#10;months, through all this awful eternity of my imprisonment to drag my&#10;dead carcass to their feast.&#10;&#10;For two days no food was brought me, but then a new messenger appeared&#10;and my incarceration went on as before, but not again did I allow my&#10;reason to be submerged by the horror of my position.&#10;&#10;Shortly after this episode another prisoner was brought in and chained&#10;near me.  By the dim torch light I saw that he was a red Martian and I&#10;could scarcely await the departure of his guards to address him.  As&#10;their retreating footsteps died away in the distance, I called out&#10;softly the Martian word of greeting, kaor.&#10;&#10;&quot;Who are you who speaks out of the darkness?&quot; he answered&#10;&#10;&quot;John Carter, a friend of the red men of Helium.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am of Helium,&quot; he said, &quot;but I do not recall your name.&quot;&#10;&#10;And then I told him my story as I have written it here, omitting only&#10;any reference to my love for Dejah Thoris.  He was much excited by the&#10;news of Helium's princess and seemed quite positive that she and Sola&#10;could easily have reached a point of safety from where they left me.&#10;He said that he knew the place well because the defile through which&#10;the Warhoon warriors had passed when they discovered us was the only&#10;one ever used by them when marching to the south.&#10;&#10;&quot;Dejah Thoris and Sola entered the hills not five miles from a great&#10;waterway and are now probably quite safe,&quot; he assured me.&#10;&#10;My fellow prisoner was Kantos Kan, a padwar (lieutenant) in the navy of&#10;Helium.  He had been a member of the ill-fated expedition which had&#10;fallen into the hands of the Tharks at the time of Dejah Thoris'&#10;capture, and he briefly related the events which followed the defeat of&#10;the battleships.&#10;&#10;Badly injured and only partially manned they had limped slowly toward&#10;Helium, but while passing near the city of Zodanga, the capital of&#10;Helium's hereditary enemies among the red men of Barsoom, they had been&#10;attacked by a great body of war vessels and all but the craft to which&#10;Kantos Kan belonged were either destroyed or captured.  His vessel was&#10;chased for days by three of the Zodangan war ships but finally escaped&#10;during the darkness of a moonless night.&#10;&#10;Thirty days after the capture of Dejah Thoris, or about the time of our&#10;coming to Thark, his vessel had reached Helium with about ten survivors&#10;of the original crew of seven hundred officers and men.  Immediately&#10;seven great fleets, each of one hundred mighty war ships, had been&#10;dispatched to search for Dejah Thoris, and from these vessels two&#10;thousand smaller craft had been kept out continuously in futile search&#10;for the missing princess.&#10;&#10;Two green Martian communities had been wiped off the face of Barsoom by&#10;the avenging fleets, but no trace of Dejah Thoris had been found.  They&#10;had been searching among the northern hordes, and only within the past&#10;few days had they extended their quest to the south.&#10;&#10;Kantos Kan had been detailed to one of the small one-man fliers and had&#10;had the misfortune to be discovered by the Warhoons while exploring&#10;their city.  The bravery and daring of the man won my greatest respect&#10;and admiration.  Alone he had landed at the city's boundary and on foot&#10;had penetrated to the buildings surrounding the plaza.  For two days&#10;and nights he had explored their quarters and their dungeons in search&#10;of his beloved princess only to fall into the hands of a party of&#10;Warhoons as he was about to leave, after assuring himself that Dejah&#10;Thoris was not a captive there.&#10;&#10;During the period of our incarceration Kantos Kan and I became well&#10;acquainted, and formed a warm personal friendship.  A few days only&#10;elapsed, however, before we were dragged forth from our dungeon for the&#10;great games.  We were conducted early one morning to an enormous&#10;amphitheater, which instead of having been built upon the surface of&#10;the ground was excavated below the surface.  It had partially filled&#10;with debris so that how large it had originally been was difficult to&#10;say.  In its present condition it held the entire twenty thousand&#10;Warhoons of the assembled hordes.&#10;&#10;The arena was immense but extremely uneven and unkempt.  Around it the&#10;Warhoons had piled building stone from some of the ruined edifices of&#10;the ancient city to prevent the animals and the captives from escaping&#10;into the audience, and at each end had been constructed cages to hold&#10;them until their turns came to meet some horrible death upon the arena.&#10;&#10;Kantos Kan and I were confined together in one of the cages.  In the&#10;others were wild calots, thoats, mad zitidars, green warriors, and&#10;women of other hordes, and many strange and ferocious wild beasts of&#10;Barsoom which I had never before seen.  The din of their roaring,&#10;growling and squealing was deafening and the formidable appearance of&#10;any one of them was enough to make the stoutest heart feel grave&#10;forebodings.&#10;&#10;Kantos Kan explained to me that at the end of the day one of these&#10;prisoners would gain freedom and the others would lie dead about the&#10;arena.  The winners in the various contests of the day would be pitted&#10;against each other until only two remained alive; the victor in the&#10;last encounter being set free, whether animal or man.  The following&#10;morning the cages would be filled with a new consignment of victims,&#10;and so on throughout the ten days of the games.&#10;&#10;Shortly after we had been caged the amphitheater began to fill and&#10;within an hour every available part of the seating space was occupied.&#10;Dak Kova, with his jeds and chieftains, sat at the center of one side&#10;of the arena upon a large raised platform.&#10;&#10;At a signal from Dak Kova the doors of two cages were thrown open and a&#10;dozen green Martian females were driven to the center of the arena.&#10;Each was given a dagger and then, at the far end, a pack of twelve&#10;calots, or wild dogs were loosed upon them.&#10;&#10;As the brutes, growling and foaming, rushed upon the almost defenseless&#10;women I turned my head that I might not see the horrid sight.  The&#10;yells and laughter of the green horde bore witness to the excellent&#10;quality of the sport and when I turned back to the arena, as Kantos Kan&#10;told me it was over, I saw three victorious calots, snarling and&#10;growling over the bodies of their prey.  The women had given a good&#10;account of themselves.&#10;&#10;Next a mad zitidar was loosed among the remaining dogs, and so it went&#10;throughout the long, hot, horrible day.&#10;&#10;During the day I was pitted against first men and then beasts, but as I&#10;was armed with a long-sword and always outclassed my adversary in&#10;agility and generally in strength as well, it proved but child's play&#10;to me.  Time and time again I won the applause of the bloodthirsty&#10;multitude, and toward the end there were cries that I be taken from the&#10;arena and be made a member of the hordes of Warhoon.&#10;&#10;Finally there were but three of us left, a great green warrior of some&#10;far northern horde, Kantos Kan, and myself.&#10;&#10;The other two were to battle and then I to fight the conqueror for the&#10;liberty which was accorded the final winner.&#10;&#10;Kantos Kan had fought several times during the day and like myself had&#10;always proven victorious, but occasionally by the smallest of margins,&#10;especially when pitted against the green warriors.  I had little hope&#10;that he could best his giant adversary who had mowed down all before&#10;him during the day.  The fellow towered nearly sixteen feet in height,&#10;while Kantos Kan was some inches under six feet.  As they advanced to&#10;meet one another I saw for the first time a trick of Martian&#10;swordsmanship which centered Kantos Kan's every hope of victory and&#10;life on one cast of the dice, for, as he came to within about twenty&#10;feet of the huge fellow he threw his sword arm far behind him over his&#10;shoulder and with a mighty sweep hurled his weapon point foremost at&#10;the green warrior.  It flew true as an arrow and piercing the poor&#10;devil's heart laid him dead upon the arena.&#10;&#10;Kantos Kan and I were now pitted against each other but as we&#10;approached to the encounter I whispered to him to prolong the battle&#10;until nearly dark in the hope that we might find some means of escape.&#10;The horde evidently guessed that we had no hearts to fight each other&#10;and so they howled in rage as neither of us placed a fatal thrust.&#10;Just as I saw the sudden coming of dark I whispered to Kantos Kan to&#10;thrust his sword between my left arm and my body.  As he did so I&#10;staggered back clasping the sword tightly with my arm and thus fell to&#10;the ground with his weapon apparently protruding from my chest.  Kantos&#10;Kan perceived my coup and stepping quickly to my side he placed his&#10;foot upon my neck and withdrawing his sword from my body gave me the&#10;final death blow through the neck which is supposed to sever the&#10;jugular vein, but in this instance the cold blade slipped harmlessly&#10;into the sand of the arena.  In the darkness which had now fallen none&#10;could tell but that he had really finished me.  I whispered to him to&#10;go and claim his freedom and then look for me in the hills east of the&#10;city, and so he left me.&#10;&#10;When the amphitheater had cleared I crept stealthily to the top and as&#10;the great excavation lay far from the plaza and in an untenanted&#10;portion of the great dead city I had little trouble in reaching the&#10;hills beyond.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER XX&#10;&#10;IN THE ATMOSPHERE FACTORY&#10;&#10;&#10;For two days I waited there for Kantos Kan, but as he did not come I&#10;started off on foot in a northwesterly direction toward a point where&#10;he had told me lay the nearest waterway.  My only food consisted of&#10;vegetable milk from the plants which gave so bounteously of this&#10;priceless fluid.&#10;&#10;Through two long weeks I wandered, stumbling through the nights guided&#10;only by the stars and hiding during the days behind some protruding&#10;rock or among the occasional hills I traversed.  Several times I was&#10;attacked by wild beasts; strange, uncouth monstrosities that leaped&#10;upon me in the dark, so that I had ever to grasp my long-sword in my&#10;hand that I might be ready for them.  Usually my strange, newly&#10;acquired telepathic power warned me in ample time, but once I was down&#10;with vicious fangs at my jugular and a hairy face pressed close to mine&#10;before I knew that I was even threatened.&#10;&#10;What manner of thing was upon me I did not know, but that it was large&#10;and heavy and many-legged I could feel.  My hands were at its throat&#10;before the fangs had a chance to bury themselves in my neck, and slowly&#10;I forced the hairy face from me and closed my fingers, vise-like, upon&#10;its windpipe.&#10;&#10;Without sound we lay there, the beast exerting every effort to reach me&#10;with those awful fangs, and I straining to maintain my grip and choke&#10;the life from it as I kept it from my throat.  Slowly my arms gave to&#10;the unequal struggle, and inch by inch the burning eyes and gleaming&#10;tusks of my antagonist crept toward me, until, as the hairy face&#10;touched mine again, I realized that all was over.  And then a living&#10;mass of destruction sprang from the surrounding darkness full upon the&#10;creature that held me pinioned to the ground.  The two rolled growling&#10;upon the moss, tearing and rending one another in a frightful manner,&#10;but it was soon over and my preserver stood with lowered head above the&#10;throat of the dead thing which would have killed me.&#10;&#10;The nearer moon, hurtling suddenly above the horizon and lighting up&#10;the Barsoomian scene, showed me that my preserver was Woola, but from&#10;whence he had come, or how found me, I was at a loss to know.  That I&#10;was glad of his companionship it is needless to say, but my pleasure at&#10;seeing him was tempered by anxiety as to the reason of his leaving&#10;Dejah Thoris.  Only her death I felt sure, could account for his&#10;absence from her, so faithful I knew him to be to my commands.&#10;&#10;By the light of the now brilliant moons I saw that he was but a shadow&#10;of his former self, and as he turned from my caress and commenced&#10;greedily to devour the dead carcass at my feet I realized that the poor&#10;fellow was more than half starved.  I, myself, was in but little better&#10;plight but I could not bring myself to eat the uncooked flesh and I had&#10;no means of making a fire.  When Woola had finished his meal I again&#10;took up my weary and seemingly endless wandering in quest of the&#10;elusive waterway.&#10;&#10;At daybreak of the fifteenth day of my search I was overjoyed to see&#10;the high trees that denoted the object of my search.  About noon I&#10;dragged myself wearily to the portals of a huge building which covered&#10;perhaps four square miles and towered two hundred feet in the air.  It&#10;showed no aperture in the mighty walls other than the tiny door at&#10;which I sank exhausted, nor was there any sign of life about it.&#10;&#10;I could find no bell or other method of making my presence known to the&#10;inmates of the place, unless a small round hole in the wall near the&#10;door was for that purpose.  It was of about the bigness of a lead&#10;pencil and thinking that it might be in the nature of a speaking tube I&#10;put my mouth to it and was about to call into it when a voice issued&#10;from it asking me whom I might be, where from, and the nature of my&#10;errand.&#10;&#10;I explained that I had escaped from the Warhoons and was dying of&#10;starvation and exhaustion.&#10;&#10;&quot;You wear the metal of a green warrior and are followed by a calot, yet&#10;you are of the figure of a red man.  In color you are neither green nor&#10;red.  In the name of the ninth day, what manner of creature are you?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am a friend of the red men of Barsoom and I am starving.  In the&#10;name of humanity open to us,&quot; I replied.&#10;&#10;Presently the door commenced to recede before me until it had sunk into&#10;the wall fifty feet, then it stopped and slid easily to the left,&#10;exposing a short, narrow corridor of concrete, at the further end of&#10;which was another door, similar in every respect to the one I had just&#10;passed.  No one was in sight, yet immediately we passed the first door&#10;it slid gently into place behind us and receded rapidly to its original&#10;position in the front wall of the building.  As the door had slipped&#10;aside I had noted its great thickness, fully twenty feet, and as it&#10;reached its place once more after closing behind us, great cylinders of&#10;steel had dropped from the ceiling behind it and fitted their lower&#10;ends into apertures countersunk in the floor.&#10;&#10;A second and third door receded before me and slipped to one side as&#10;the first, before I reached a large inner chamber where I found food&#10;and drink set out upon a great stone table.  A voice directed me to&#10;satisfy my hunger and to feed my calot, and while I was thus engaged my&#10;invisible host put me through a severe and searching cross-examination.&#10;&#10;&quot;Your statements are most remarkable,&quot; said the voice, on concluding&#10;its questioning, &quot;but you are evidently speaking the truth, and it is&#10;equally evident that you are not of Barsoom.  I can tell that by the&#10;conformation of your brain and the strange location of your internal&#10;organs and the shape and size of your heart.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Can you see through me?&quot; I exclaimed.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, I can see all but your thoughts, and were you a Barsoomian I&#10;could read those.&quot;&#10;&#10;Then a door opened at the far side of the chamber and a strange, dried&#10;up, little mummy of a man came toward me.  He wore but a single article&#10;of clothing or adornment, a small collar of gold from which depended&#10;upon his chest a great ornament as large as a dinner plate set solid&#10;with huge diamonds, except for the exact center which was occupied by a&#10;strange stone, an inch in diameter, that scintillated nine different&#10;and distinct rays; the seven colors of our earthly prism and two&#10;beautiful rays which, to me, were new and nameless.  I cannot describe&#10;them any more than you could describe red to a blind man.  I only know&#10;that they were beautiful in the extreme.&#10;&#10;The old man sat and talked with me for hours, and the strangest part of&#10;our intercourse was that I could read his every thought while he could&#10;not fathom an iota from my mind unless I spoke.&#10;&#10;[Illustration: The old man sat and talked with me for hours.]&#10;&#10;I did not apprise him of my ability to sense his mental operations, and&#10;thus I learned a great deal which proved of immense value to me later&#10;and which I would never have known had he suspected my strange power,&#10;for the Martians have such perfect control of their mental machinery&#10;that they are able to direct their thoughts with absolute precision.&#10;&#10;The building in which I found myself contained the machinery which&#10;produces that artificial atmosphere which sustains life on Mars.  The&#10;secret of the entire process hinges on the use of the ninth ray, one of&#10;the beautiful scintillations which I had noted emanating from the great&#10;stone in my host's diadem.&#10;&#10;This ray is separated from the other rays of the sun by means of finely&#10;adjusted instruments placed upon the roof of the huge building,&#10;three-quarters of which is used for reservoirs in which the ninth ray&#10;is stored.  This product is then treated electrically, or rather&#10;certain proportions of refined electric vibrations are incorporated&#10;with it, and the result is then pumped to the five principal air&#10;centers of the planet where, as it is released, contact with the ether&#10;of space transforms it into atmosphere.&#10;&#10;There is always sufficient reserve of the ninth ray stored in the great&#10;building to maintain the present Martian atmosphere for a thousand&#10;years, and the only fear, as my new friend told me, was that some&#10;accident might befall the pumping apparatus.&#10;&#10;He led me to an inner chamber where I beheld a battery of twenty radium&#10;pumps any one of which was equal to the task of furnishing all Mars&#10;with the atmosphere compound.  For eight hundred years, he told me, he&#10;had watched these pumps which are used alternately a day each at a&#10;stretch, or a little over twenty-four and one-half Earth hours.  He has&#10;one assistant who divides the watch with him.  Half a Martian year,&#10;about three hundred and forty-four of our days, each of these men spend&#10;alone in this huge, isolated plant.&#10;&#10;Every red Martian is taught during earliest childhood the principles of&#10;the manufacture of atmosphere, but only two at one time ever hold the&#10;secret of ingress to the great building, which, built as it is with&#10;walls a hundred and fifty feet thick, is absolutely unassailable, even&#10;the roof being guarded from assault by air craft by a glass covering&#10;five feet thick.&#10;&#10;The only fear they entertain of attack is from the green Martians or&#10;some demented red man, as all Barsoomians realize that the very&#10;existence of every form of life of Mars is dependent upon the&#10;uninterrupted working of this plant.&#10;&#10;One curious fact I discovered as I watched his thoughts was that the&#10;outer doors are manipulated by telepathic means.  The locks are so&#10;finely adjusted that the doors are released by the action of a certain&#10;combination of thought waves.  To experiment with my new-found toy I&#10;thought to surprise him into revealing this combination and so I asked&#10;him in a casual manner how he had managed to unlock the massive doors&#10;for me from the inner chambers of the building.  As quick as a flash&#10;there leaped to his mind nine Martian sounds, but as quickly faded as&#10;he answered that this was a secret he must not divulge.&#10;&#10;From then on his manner toward me changed as though he feared that he&#10;had been surprised into divulging his great secret, and I read&#10;suspicion and fear in his looks and thoughts, though his words were&#10;still fair.&#10;&#10;Before I retired for the night he promised to give me a letter to a&#10;nearby agricultural officer who would help me on my way to Zodanga,&#10;which he said, was the nearest Martian city.&#10;&#10;&quot;But be sure that you do not let them know you are bound for Helium as&#10;they are at war with that country.  My assistant and I are of no&#10;country, we belong to all Barsoom and this talisman which we wear&#10;protects us in all lands, even among the green men--though we do not&#10;trust ourselves to their hands if we can avoid it,&quot; he added.&#10;&#10;&quot;And so good-night, my friend,&quot; he continued, &quot;may you have a long and&#10;restful sleep--yes, a long sleep.&quot;&#10;&#10;And though he smiled pleasantly I saw in his thoughts the wish that he&#10;had never admitted me, and then a picture of him standing over me in&#10;the night, and the swift thrust of a long dagger and the half formed&#10;words, &quot;I am sorry, but it is for the best good of Barsoom.&quot;&#10;&#10;As he closed the door of my chamber behind him his thoughts were cut&#10;off from me as was the sight of him, which seemed strange to me in my&#10;little knowledge of thought transference.&#10;&#10;What was I to do?  How could I escape through these mighty walls?&#10;Easily could I kill him now that I was warned, but once he was dead I&#10;could no more escape, and with the stopping of the machinery of the&#10;great plant I should die with all the other inhabitants of the&#10;planet--all, even Dejah Thoris were she not already dead.  For the&#10;others I did not give the snap of my finger, but the thought of Dejah&#10;Thoris drove from my mind all desire to kill my mistaken host.&#10;&#10;Cautiously I opened the door of my apartment and, followed by Woola,&#10;sought the inner of the great doors.  A wild scheme had come to me; I&#10;would attempt to force the great locks by the nine thought waves I had&#10;read in my host's mind.&#10;&#10;Creeping stealthily through corridor after corridor and down winding&#10;runways which turned hither and thither I finally reached the great&#10;hall in which I had broken my long fast that morning.  Nowhere had I&#10;seen my host, nor did I know where he kept himself by night.&#10;&#10;I was on the point of stepping boldly out into the room when a slight&#10;noise behind me warned me back into the shadows of a recess in the&#10;corridor.  Dragging Woola after me I crouched low in the darkness.&#10;&#10;Presently the old man passed close by me, and as he entered the dimly&#10;lighted chamber which I had been about to pass through I saw that he&#10;held a long thin dagger in his hand and that he was sharpening it upon&#10;a stone.  In his mind was the decision to inspect the radium pumps,&#10;which would take about thirty minutes, and then return to my bed&#10;chamber and finish me.&#10;&#10;As he passed through the great hall and disappeared down the runway&#10;which led to the pump-room, I stole stealthily from my hiding place and&#10;crossed to the great door, the inner of the three which stood between&#10;me and liberty.&#10;&#10;Concentrating my mind upon the massive lock I hurled the nine thought&#10;waves against it.  In breathless expectancy I waited, when finally the&#10;great door moved softly toward me and slid quietly to one side.  One&#10;after the other the remaining mighty portals opened at my command and&#10;Woola and I stepped forth into the darkness, free, but little better&#10;off than we had been before, other than that we had full stomachs.&#10;&#10;Hastening away from the shadows of the formidable pile I made for the&#10;first crossroad, intending to strike the central turnpike as quickly as&#10;possible.  This I reached about morning and entering the first&#10;enclosure I came to I searched for some evidences of a habitation.&#10;&#10;There were low rambling buildings of concrete barred with heavy&#10;impassable doors, and no amount of hammering and hallooing brought any&#10;response.  Weary and exhausted from sleeplessness I threw myself upon&#10;the ground commanding Woola to stand guard.&#10;&#10;Some time later I was awakened by his frightful growlings and opened my&#10;eyes to see three red Martians standing a short distance from us and&#10;covering me with their rifles.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am unarmed and no enemy,&quot; I hastened to explain.  &quot;I have been a&#10;prisoner among the green men and am on my way to Zodanga.  All I ask is&#10;food and rest for myself and my calot and the proper directions for&#10;reaching my destination.&quot;&#10;&#10;They lowered their rifles and advanced pleasantly toward me placing&#10;their right hands upon my left shoulder, after the manner of their&#10;custom of salute, and asking me many questions about myself and my&#10;wanderings.  They then took me to the house of one of them which was&#10;only a short distance away.&#10;&#10;The buildings I had been hammering at in the early morning were&#10;occupied only by stock and farm produce, the house proper standing&#10;among a grove of enormous trees, and, like all red-Martian homes, had&#10;been raised at night some forty or fifty feet from the ground on a&#10;large round metal shaft which slid up or down within a sleeve sunk in&#10;the ground, and was operated by a tiny radium engine in the entrance&#10;hall of the building.  Instead of bothering with bolts and bars for&#10;their dwellings, the red Martians simply run them up out of harm's way&#10;during the night.  They also have private means for lowering or raising&#10;them from the ground without if they wish to go away and leave them.&#10;&#10;These brothers, with their wives and children, occupied three similar&#10;houses on this farm.  They did no work themselves, being government&#10;officers in charge.  The labor was performed by convicts, prisoners of&#10;war, delinquent debtors and confirmed bachelors who were too poor to&#10;pay the high celibate tax which all red-Martian governments impose.&#10;&#10;They were the personification of cordiality and hospitality and I spent&#10;several days with them, resting and recuperating from my long and&#10;arduous experiences.&#10;&#10;When they had heard my story--I omitted all reference to Dejah Thoris&#10;and the old man of the atmosphere plant--they advised me to color my&#10;body to more nearly resemble their own race and then attempt to find&#10;employment in Zodanga, either in the army or the navy.&#10;&#10;&quot;The chances are small that your tale will be believed until after you&#10;have proven your trustworthiness and won friends among the higher&#10;nobles of the court.  This you can most easily do through military&#10;service, as we are a warlike people on Barsoom,&quot; explained one of them,&#10;&quot;and save our richest favors for the fighting man.&quot;&#10;&#10;When I was ready to depart they furnished me with a small domestic bull&#10;thoat, such as is used for saddle purposes by all red Martians.  The&#10;animal is about the size of a horse and quite gentle, but in color and&#10;shape an exact replica of his huge and fierce cousin of the wilds.&#10;&#10;The brothers had supplied me with a reddish oil with which I anointed&#10;my entire body and one of them cut my hair, which had grown quite long,&#10;in the prevailing fashion of the time, square at the back and banged in&#10;front, so that I could have passed anywhere upon Barsoom as a&#10;full-fledged red Martian.  My metal and ornaments were also renewed in&#10;the style of a Zodangan gentleman, attached to the house of Ptor, which&#10;was the family name of my benefactors.&#10;&#10;They filled a little sack at my side with Zodangan money.  The medium&#10;of exchange upon Mars is not dissimilar from our own except that the&#10;coins are oval.  Paper money is issued by individuals as they require&#10;it and redeemed twice yearly.  If a man issues more than he can redeem,&#10;the government pays his creditors in full and the debtor works out the&#10;amount upon the farms or in mines, which are all owned by the&#10;government.  This suits everybody except the debtor as it has been a&#10;difficult thing to obtain sufficient voluntary labor to work the great&#10;isolated farm lands of Mars, stretching as they do like narrow ribbons&#10;from pole to pole, through wild stretches peopled by wild animals and&#10;wilder men.&#10;&#10;When I mentioned my inability to repay them for their kindness to me&#10;they assured me that I would have ample opportunity if I lived long&#10;upon Barsoom, and bidding me farewell they watched me until I was out&#10;of sight upon the broad white turnpike.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER XXI&#10;&#10;AN AIR SCOUT FOR ZODANGA&#10;&#10;&#10;As I proceeded on my journey toward Zodanga many strange and&#10;interesting sights arrested my attention, and at the several farm&#10;houses where I stopped I learned a number of new and instructive things&#10;concerning the methods and manners of Barsoom.&#10;&#10;The water which supplies the farms of Mars is collected in immense&#10;underground reservoirs at either pole from the melting ice caps, and&#10;pumped through long conduits to the various populated centers.  Along&#10;either side of these conduits, and extending their entire length, lie&#10;the cultivated districts.  These are divided into tracts of about the&#10;same size, each tract being under the supervision of one or more&#10;government officers.&#10;&#10;Instead of flooding the surface of the fields, and thus wasting immense&#10;quantities of water by evaporation, the precious liquid is carried&#10;underground through a vast network of small pipes directly to the roots&#10;of the vegetation.  The crops upon Mars are always uniform, for there&#10;are no droughts, no rains, no high winds, and no insects, or destroying&#10;birds.&#10;&#10;On this trip I tasted the first meat I had eaten since leaving&#10;Earth--large, juicy steaks and chops from the well-fed domestic animals&#10;of the farms.  Also I enjoyed luscious fruits and vegetables, but not a&#10;single article of food which was exactly similar to anything on Earth.&#10;Every plant and flower and vegetable and animal has been so refined by&#10;ages of careful, scientific cultivation and breeding that the like of&#10;them on Earth dwindled into pale, gray, characterless nothingness by&#10;comparison.&#10;&#10;At a second stop I met some highly cultivated people of the noble class&#10;and while in conversation we chanced to speak of Helium.  One of the&#10;older men had been there on a diplomatic mission several years before&#10;and spoke with regret of the conditions which seemed destined ever to&#10;keep these two countries at war.&#10;&#10;&quot;Helium,&quot; he said, &quot;rightly boasts the most beautiful women of Barsoom,&#10;and of all her treasures the wondrous daughter of Mors Kajak, Dejah&#10;Thoris, is the most exquisite flower.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why,&quot; he added, &quot;the people really worship the ground she walks upon&#10;and since her loss on that ill-starred expedition all Helium has been&#10;draped in mourning.&#10;&#10;&quot;That our ruler should have attacked the disabled fleet as it was&#10;returning to Helium was but another of his awful blunders which I fear&#10;will sooner or later compel Zodanga to elevate a wiser man to his&#10;place.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Even now, though our victorious armies are surrounding Helium, the&#10;people of Zodanga are voicing their displeasure, for the war is not a&#10;popular one, since it is not based on right or justice.  Our forces&#10;took advantage of the absence of the principal fleet of Helium on their&#10;search for the princess, and so we have been able easily to reduce the&#10;city to a sorry plight.  It is said she will fall within the next few&#10;passages of the further moon.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And what, think you, may have been the fate of the princess, Dejah&#10;Thoris?&quot; I asked as casually as possible.&#10;&#10;&quot;She is dead,&quot; he answered.  &quot;This much was learned from a green&#10;warrior recently captured by our forces in the south.  She escaped from&#10;the hordes of Thark with a strange creature of another world, only to&#10;fall into the hands of the Warhoons.  Their thoats were found wandering&#10;upon the sea bottom and evidences of a bloody conflict were discovered&#10;nearby.&quot;&#10;&#10;While this information was in no way reassuring, neither was it at all&#10;conclusive proof of the death of Dejah Thoris, and so I determined to&#10;make every effort possible to reach Helium as quickly as I could and&#10;carry to Tardos Mors such news of his granddaughter's possible&#10;whereabouts as lay in my power.&#10;&#10;Ten days after leaving the three Ptor brothers I arrived at Zodanga.&#10;From the moment that I had come in contact with the red inhabitants of&#10;Mars I had noticed that Woola drew a great amount of unwelcome&#10;attention to me, since the huge brute belonged to a species which is&#10;never domesticated by the red men.  Were one to stroll down Broadway&#10;with a Numidian lion at his heels the effect would be somewhat similar&#10;to that which I should have produced had I entered Zodanga with Woola.&#10;&#10;The very thought of parting with the faithful fellow caused me so great&#10;regret and genuine sorrow that I put it off until just before we&#10;arrived at the city's gates; but then, finally, it became imperative&#10;that we separate.  Had nothing further than my own safety or pleasure&#10;been at stake no argument could have prevailed upon me to turn away the&#10;one creature upon Barsoom that had never failed in a demonstration of&#10;affection and loyalty; but as I would willingly have offered my life in&#10;the service of her in search of whom I was about to challenge the&#10;unknown dangers of this, to me, mysterious city, I could not permit&#10;even Woola's life to threaten the success of my venture, much less his&#10;momentary happiness, for I doubted not he soon would forget me.  And so&#10;I bade the poor beast an affectionate farewell, promising him, however,&#10;that if I came through my adventure in safety that in some way I should&#10;find the means to search him out.&#10;&#10;He seemed to understand me fully, and when I pointed back in the&#10;direction of Thark he turned sorrowfully away, nor could I bear to&#10;watch him go; but resolutely set my face toward Zodanga and with a&#10;touch of heartsickness approached her frowning walls.&#10;&#10;The letter I bore from them gained me immediate entrance to the vast,&#10;walled city.  It was still very early in the morning and the streets&#10;were practically deserted.  The residences, raised high upon their&#10;metal columns, resembled huge rookeries, while the uprights themselves&#10;presented the appearance of steel tree trunks.  The shops as a rule&#10;were not raised from the ground nor were their doors bolted or barred,&#10;since thievery is practically unknown upon Barsoom.  Assassination is&#10;the ever-present fear of all Barsoomians, and for this reason alone&#10;their homes are raised high above the ground at night, or in times of&#10;danger.&#10;&#10;The Ptor brothers had given me explicit directions for reaching the&#10;point of the city where I could find living accommodations and be near&#10;the offices of the government agents to whom they had given me letters.&#10;My way led to the central square or plaza, which is a characteristic of&#10;all Martian cities.&#10;&#10;The plaza of Zodanga covers a square mile and is bounded by the palaces&#10;of the jeddak, the jeds, and other members of the royalty and nobility&#10;of Zodanga, as well as by the principal public buildings, cafes, and&#10;shops.&#10;&#10;As I was crossing the great square lost in wonder and admiration of the&#10;magnificent architecture and the gorgeous scarlet vegetation which&#10;carpeted the broad lawns I discovered a red Martian walking briskly&#10;toward me from one of the avenues.  He paid not the slightest attention&#10;to me, but as he came abreast I recognized him, and turning I placed my&#10;hand upon his shoulder, calling out:&#10;&#10;&quot;Kaor, Kantos Kan!&quot;&#10;&#10;Like lightning he wheeled and before I could so much as lower my hand&#10;the point of his long-sword was at my breast.&#10;&#10;&quot;Who are you?&quot; he growled, and then as a backward leap carried me fifty&#10;feet from his sword he dropped the point to the ground and exclaimed,&#10;laughing,&#10;&#10;&quot;I do not need a better reply, there is but one man upon all Barsoom&#10;who can bounce about like a rubber ball.  By the mother of the further&#10;moon, John Carter, how came you here, and have you become a Darseen&#10;that you can change your color at will?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You gave me a bad half minute my friend,&quot; he continued, after I had&#10;briefly outlined my adventures since parting with him in the arena at&#10;Warhoon.  &quot;Were my name and city known to the Zodangans I would shortly&#10;be sitting on the banks of the lost sea of Korus with my revered and&#10;departed ancestors.  I am here in the interest of Tardos Mors, Jeddak&#10;of Helium, to discover the whereabouts of Dejah Thoris, our princess.&#10;Sab Than, prince of Zodanga, has her hidden in the city and has fallen&#10;madly in love with her.  His father, Than Kosis, Jeddak of Zodanga, has&#10;made her voluntary marriage to his son the price of peace between our&#10;countries, but Tardos Mors will not accede to the demands and has sent&#10;word that he and his people would rather look upon the dead face of&#10;their princess than see her wed to any than her own choice, and that&#10;personally he would prefer being engulfed in the ashes of a lost and&#10;burning Helium to joining the metal of his house with that of Than&#10;Kosis.  His reply was the deadliest affront he could have put upon Than&#10;Kosis and the Zodangans, but his people love him the more for it and&#10;his strength in Helium is greater today than ever.&#10;&#10;&quot;I have been here three days,&quot; continued Kantos Kan, &quot;but I have not&#10;yet found where Dejah Thoris is imprisoned.  Today I join the Zodangan&#10;navy as an air scout and I hope in this way to win the confidence of&#10;Sab Than, the prince, who is commander of this division of the navy,&#10;and thus learn the whereabouts of Dejah Thoris.  I am glad that you are&#10;here, John Carter, for I know your loyalty to my princess and two of us&#10;working together should be able to accomplish much.&quot;&#10;&#10;The plaza was now commencing to fill with people going and coming upon&#10;the daily activities of their duties.  The shops were opening and the&#10;cafes filling with early morning patrons.  Kantos Kan led me to one of&#10;these gorgeous eating places where we were served entirely by&#10;mechanical apparatus.  No hand touched the food from the time it&#10;entered the building in its raw state until it emerged hot and&#10;delicious upon the tables before the guests, in response to the&#10;touching of tiny buttons to indicate their desires.&#10;&#10;After our meal, Kantos Kan took me with him to the headquarters of the&#10;air-scout squadron and introducing me to his superior asked that I be&#10;enrolled as a member of the corps.  In accordance with custom an&#10;examination was necessary, but Kantos Kan had told me to have no fear&#10;on this score as he would attend to that part of the matter.  He&#10;accomplished this by taking my order for examination to the examining&#10;officer and representing himself as John Carter.&#10;&#10;&quot;This ruse will be discovered later,&quot; he cheerfully explained, &quot;when&#10;they check up my weights, measurements, and other personal&#10;identification data, but it will be several months before this is done&#10;and our mission should be accomplished or have failed long before that&#10;time.&quot;&#10;&#10;The next few days were spent by Kantos Kan in teaching me the&#10;intricacies of flying and of repairing the dainty little contrivances&#10;which the Martians use for this purpose.  The body of the one-man air&#10;craft is about sixteen feet long, two feet wide and three inches thick,&#10;tapering to a point at each end.  The driver sits on top of this plane&#10;upon a seat constructed over the small, noiseless radium engine which&#10;propels it.  The medium of buoyancy is contained within the thin metal&#10;walls of the body and consists of the eighth Barsoomian ray, or ray of&#10;propulsion, as it may be termed in view of its properties.&#10;&#10;This ray, like the ninth ray, is unknown on Earth, but the Martians&#10;have discovered that it is an inherent property of all light no matter&#10;from what source it emanates.  They have learned that it is the solar&#10;eighth ray which propels the light of the sun to the various planets,&#10;and that it is the individual eighth ray of each planet which&#10;&quot;reflects,&quot; or propels the light thus obtained out into space once&#10;more.  The solar eighth ray would be absorbed by the surface of&#10;Barsoom, but the Barsoomian eighth ray, which tends to propel light&#10;from Mars into space, is constantly streaming out from the planet&#10;constituting a force of repulsion of gravity which when confined is&#10;able to lift enormous weights from the surface of the ground.&#10;&#10;It is this ray which has enabled them to so perfect aviation that&#10;battle ships far outweighing anything known upon Earth sail as&#10;gracefully and lightly through the thin air of Barsoom as a toy balloon&#10;in the heavy atmosphere of Earth.&#10;&#10;During the early years of the discovery of this ray many strange&#10;accidents occurred before the Martians learned to measure and control&#10;the wonderful power they had found.  In one instance, some nine hundred&#10;years before, the first great battle ship to be built with eighth ray&#10;reservoirs was stored with too great a quantity of the rays and she had&#10;sailed up from Helium with five hundred officers and men, never to&#10;return.&#10;&#10;Her power of repulsion for the planet was so great that it had carried&#10;her far into space, where she can be seen today, by the aid of powerful&#10;telescopes, hurtling through the heavens ten thousand miles from Mars;&#10;a tiny satellite that will thus encircle Barsoom to the end of time.&#10;&#10;The fourth day after my arrival at Zodanga I made my first flight, and&#10;as a result of it I won a promotion which included quarters in the&#10;palace of Than Kosis.&#10;&#10;As I rose above the city I circled several times, as I had seen Kantos&#10;Kan do, and then throwing my engine into top speed I raced at terrific&#10;velocity toward the south, following one of the great waterways which&#10;enter Zodanga from that direction.&#10;&#10;I had traversed perhaps two hundred miles in a little less than an hour&#10;when I descried far below me a party of three green warriors racing&#10;madly toward a small figure on foot which seemed to be trying to reach&#10;the confines of one of the walled fields.&#10;&#10;Dropping my machine rapidly toward them, and circling to the rear of&#10;the warriors, I soon saw that the object of their pursuit was a red&#10;Martian wearing the metal of the scout squadron to which I was&#10;attached.  A short distance away lay his tiny flier, surrounded by the&#10;tools with which he had evidently been occupied in repairing some&#10;damage when surprised by the green warriors.&#10;&#10;They were now almost upon him; their flying mounts charging down on the&#10;relatively puny figure at terrific speed, while the warriors leaned low&#10;to the right, with their great metal-shod spears.  Each seemed striving&#10;to be the first to impale the poor Zodangan and in another moment his&#10;fate would have been sealed had it not been for my timely arrival.&#10;&#10;Driving my fleet air craft at high speed directly behind the warriors I&#10;soon overtook them and without diminishing my speed I rammed the prow&#10;of my little flier between the shoulders of the nearest.  The impact&#10;sufficient to have torn through inches of solid steel, hurled the&#10;fellow's headless body into the air over the head of his thoat, where&#10;it fell sprawling upon the moss.  The mounts of the other two warriors&#10;turned squealing in terror, and bolted in opposite directions.&#10;&#10;Reducing my speed I circled and came to the ground at the feet of the&#10;astonished Zodangan.  He was warm in his thanks for my timely aid and&#10;promised that my day's work would bring the reward it merited, for it&#10;was none other than a cousin of the jeddak of Zodanga whose life I had&#10;saved.&#10;&#10;We wasted no time in talk as we knew that the warriors would surely&#10;return as soon as they had gained control of their mounts.  Hastening&#10;to his damaged machine we were bending every effort to finish the&#10;needed repairs and had almost completed them when we saw the two green&#10;monsters returning at top speed from opposite sides of us.  When they&#10;had approached within a hundred yards their thoats again became&#10;unmanageable and absolutely refused to advance further toward the air&#10;craft which had frightened them.&#10;&#10;The warriors finally dismounted and hobbling their animals advanced&#10;toward us on foot with drawn long-swords.&#10;&#10;I advanced to meet the larger, telling the Zodangan to do the best he&#10;could with the other.  Finishing my man with almost no effort, as had&#10;now from much practice become habitual with me, I hastened to return to&#10;my new acquaintance whom I found indeed in desperate straits.&#10;&#10;He was wounded and down with the huge foot of his antagonist upon his&#10;throat and the great long-sword raised to deal the final thrust.  With&#10;a bound I cleared the fifty feet intervening between us, and with&#10;outstretched point drove my sword completely through the body of the&#10;green warrior.  His sword fell, harmless, to the ground and he sank&#10;limply upon the prostrate form of the Zodangan.&#10;&#10;A cursory examination of the latter revealed no mortal injuries and&#10;after a brief rest he asserted that he felt fit to attempt the return&#10;voyage.  He would have to pilot his own craft, however, as these frail&#10;vessels are not intended to convey but a single person.&#10;&#10;Quickly completing the repairs we rose together into the still,&#10;cloudless Martian sky, and at great speed and without further mishap&#10;returned to Zodanga.&#10;&#10;As we neared the city we discovered a mighty concourse of civilians and&#10;troops assembled upon the plain before the city.  The sky was black&#10;with naval vessels and private and public pleasure craft, flying long&#10;streamers of gay-colored silks, and banners and flags of odd and&#10;picturesque design.&#10;&#10;My companion signaled that I slow down, and running his machine close&#10;beside mine suggested that we approach and watch the ceremony, which,&#10;he said, was for the purpose of conferring honors on individual&#10;officers and men for bravery and other distinguished service.  He then&#10;unfurled a little ensign which denoted that his craft bore a member of&#10;the royal family of Zodanga, and together we made our way through the&#10;maze of low-lying air vessels until we hung directly over the jeddak of&#10;Zodanga and his staff.  All were mounted upon the small domestic bull&#10;thoats of the red Martians, and their trappings and ornamentation bore&#10;such a quantity of gorgeously colored feathers that I could not but be&#10;struck with the startling resemblance the concourse bore to a band of&#10;the red Indians of my own Earth.&#10;&#10;One of the staff called the attention of Than Kosis to the presence of&#10;my companion above them and the ruler motioned for him to descend.  As&#10;they waited for the troops to move into position facing the jeddak the&#10;two talked earnestly together, the jeddak and his staff occasionally&#10;glancing up at me.  I could not hear their conversation and presently&#10;it ceased and all dismounted, as the last body of troops had wheeled&#10;into position before their emperor.  A member of the staff advanced&#10;toward the troops, and calling the name of a soldier commanded him to&#10;advance.  The officer then recited the nature of the heroic act which&#10;had won the approval of the jeddak, and the latter advanced and placed&#10;a metal ornament upon the left arm of the lucky man.&#10;&#10;Ten men had been so decorated when the aide called out,&#10;&#10;&quot;John Carter, air scout!&quot;&#10;&#10;Never in my life had I been so surprised, but the habit of military&#10;discipline is strong within me, and I dropped my little machine lightly&#10;to the ground and advanced on foot as I had seen the others do.  As I&#10;halted before the officer, he addressed me in a voice audible to the&#10;entire assemblage of troops and spectators.&#10;&#10;&quot;In recognition, John Carter,&quot; he said, &quot;of your remarkable courage and&#10;skill in defending the person of the cousin of the jeddak Than Kosis&#10;and, singlehanded, vanquishing three green warriors, it is the pleasure&#10;of our jeddak to confer on you the mark of his esteem.&quot;&#10;&#10;Than Kosis then advanced toward me and placing an ornament upon me,&#10;said:&#10;&#10;&quot;My cousin has narrated the details of your wonderful achievement,&#10;which seems little short of miraculous, and if you can so well defend a&#10;cousin of the jeddak how much better could you defend the person of the&#10;jeddak himself.  You are therefore appointed a padwar of The Guards and&#10;will be quartered in my palace hereafter.&quot;&#10;&#10;I thanked him, and at his direction joined the members of his staff.&#10;After the ceremony I returned my machine to its quarters on the roof of&#10;the barracks of the air-scout squadron, and with an orderly from the&#10;palace to guide me I reported to the officer in charge of the palace.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER XXII&#10;&#10;I FIND DEJAH&#10;&#10;&#10;The major-domo to whom I reported had been given instructions to&#10;station me near the person of the jeddak, who, in time of war, is&#10;always in great danger of assassination, as the rule that all is fair&#10;in war seems to constitute the entire ethics of Martian conflict.&#10;&#10;He therefore escorted me immediately to the apartment in which Than&#10;Kosis then was.  The ruler was engaged in conversation with his son,&#10;Sab Than, and several courtiers of his household, and did not perceive&#10;my entrance.&#10;&#10;The walls of the apartment were completely hung with splendid&#10;tapestries which hid any windows or doors which may have pierced them.&#10;The room was lighted by imprisoned rays of sunshine held between the&#10;ceiling proper and what appeared to be a ground-glass false ceiling a&#10;few inches below.&#10;&#10;My guide drew aside one of the tapestries, disclosing a passage which&#10;encircled the room, between the hangings and the walls of the chamber.&#10;Within this passage I was to remain, he said, so long as Than Kosis was&#10;in the apartment.  When he left I was to follow.  My only duty was to&#10;guard the ruler and keep out of sight as much as possible.  I would be&#10;relieved after a period of four hours.  The major-domo then left me.&#10;&#10;The tapestries were of a strange weaving which gave the appearance of&#10;heavy solidity from one side, but from my hiding place I could perceive&#10;all that took place within the room as readily as though there had been&#10;no curtain intervening.&#10;&#10;Scarcely had I gained my post than the tapestry at the opposite end of&#10;the chamber separated and four soldiers of The Guard entered,&#10;surrounding a female figure.  As they approached Than Kosis the&#10;soldiers fell to either side and there standing before the jeddak and&#10;not ten feet from me, her beautiful face radiant with smiles, was Dejah&#10;Thoris.&#10;&#10;Sab Than, Prince of Zodanga, advanced to meet her, and hand in hand&#10;they approached close to the jeddak.  Than Kosis looked up in surprise,&#10;and, rising, saluted her.&#10;&#10;&quot;To what strange freak do I owe this visit from the Princess of Helium,&#10;who, two days ago, with rare consideration for my pride, assured me&#10;that she would prefer Tal Hajus, the green Thark, to my son?&quot;&#10;&#10;Dejah Thoris only smiled the more and with the roguish dimples playing&#10;at the corners of her mouth she made answer:&#10;&#10;&quot;From the beginning of time upon Barsoom it has been the prerogative of&#10;woman to change her mind as she listed and to dissemble in matters&#10;concerning her heart.  That you will forgive, Than Kosis, as has your&#10;son.  Two days ago I was not sure of his love for me, but now I am, and&#10;I have come to beg of you to forget my rash words and to accept the&#10;assurance of the Princess of Helium that when the time comes she will&#10;wed Sab Than, Prince of Zodanga.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am glad that you have so decided,&quot; replied Than Kosis.  &quot;It is far&#10;from my desire to push war further against the people of Helium, and,&#10;your promise shall be recorded and a proclamation to my people issued&#10;forthwith.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It were better, Than Kosis,&quot; interrupted Dejah Thoris, &quot;that the&#10;proclamation wait the ending of this war.  It would look strange indeed&#10;to my people and to yours were the Princess of Helium to give herself&#10;to her country's enemy in the midst of hostilities.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Cannot the war be ended at once?&quot; spoke Sab Than.  &quot;It requires but&#10;the word of Than Kosis to bring peace.  Say it, my father, say the word&#10;that will hasten my happiness, and end this unpopular strife.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We shall see,&quot; replied Than Kosis, &quot;how the people of Helium take to&#10;peace.  I shall at least offer it to them.&quot;&#10;&#10;Dejah Thoris, after a few words, turned and left the apartment, still&#10;followed by her guards.&#10;&#10;Thus was the edifice of my brief dream of happiness dashed, broken, to&#10;the ground of reality.  The woman for whom I had offered my life, and&#10;from whose lips I had so recently heard a declaration of love for me,&#10;had lightly forgotten my very existence and smilingly given herself to&#10;the son of her people's most hated enemy.&#10;&#10;Although I had heard it with my own ears I could not believe it.  I&#10;must search out her apartments and force her to repeat the cruel truth&#10;to me alone before I would be convinced, and so I deserted my post and&#10;hastened through the passage behind the tapestries toward the door by&#10;which she had left the chamber.  Slipping quietly through this opening&#10;I discovered a maze of winding corridors, branching and turning in&#10;every direction.&#10;&#10;Running rapidly down first one and then another of them I soon became&#10;hopelessly lost and was standing panting against a side wall when I&#10;heard voices near me.  Apparently they were coming from the opposite&#10;side of the partition against which I leaned and presently I made out&#10;the tones of Dejah Thoris.  I could not hear the words but I knew that&#10;I could not possibly be mistaken in the voice.&#10;&#10;Moving on a few steps I discovered another passageway at the end of&#10;which lay a door.  Walking boldly forward I pushed into the room only&#10;to find myself in a small antechamber in which were the four guards who&#10;had accompanied her.  One of them instantly arose and accosted me,&#10;asking the nature of my business.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am from Than Kosis,&quot; I replied, &quot;and wish to speak privately with&#10;Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And your order?&quot; asked the fellow.&#10;&#10;I did not know what he meant, but replied that I was a member of The&#10;Guard, and without waiting for a reply from him I strode toward the&#10;opposite door of the antechamber, behind which I could hear Dejah&#10;Thoris conversing.&#10;&#10;But my entrance was not to be so easily accomplished.  The guardsman&#10;stepped before me, saying,&#10;&#10;&quot;No one comes from Than Kosis without carrying an order or the&#10;password.  You must give me one or the other before you may pass.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The only order I require, my friend, to enter where I will, hangs at&#10;my side,&quot; I answered, tapping my long-sword; &quot;will you let me pass in&#10;peace or no?&quot;&#10;&#10;For reply he whipped out his own sword, calling to the others to join&#10;him, and thus the four stood, with drawn weapons, barring my further&#10;progress.&#10;&#10;&quot;You are not here by the order of Than Kosis,&quot; cried the one who had&#10;first addressed me, &quot;and not only shall you not enter the apartments of&#10;the Princess of Helium but you shall go back to Than Kosis under guard&#10;to explain this unwarranted temerity.  Throw down your sword; you&#10;cannot hope to overcome four of us,&quot; he added with a grim smile.&#10;&#10;My reply was a quick thrust which left me but three antagonists and I&#10;can assure you that they were worthy of my metal.  They had me backed&#10;against the wall in no time, fighting for my life.  Slowly I worked my&#10;way to a corner of the room where I could force them to come at me only&#10;one at a time, and thus we fought upward of twenty minutes; the&#10;clanging of steel on steel producing a veritable bedlam in the little&#10;room.&#10;&#10;The noise had brought Dejah Thoris to the door of her apartment, and&#10;there she stood throughout the conflict with Sola at her back peering&#10;over her shoulder.  Her face was set and emotionless and I knew that&#10;she did not recognize me, nor did Sola.&#10;&#10;Finally a lucky cut brought down a second guardsman and then, with only&#10;two opposing me, I changed my tactics and rushed them down after the&#10;fashion of my fighting that had won me many a victory.  The third fell&#10;within ten seconds after the second, and the last lay dead upon the&#10;bloody floor a few moments later.  They were brave men and noble&#10;fighters, and it grieved me that I had been forced to kill them, but I&#10;would have willingly depopulated all Barsoom could I have reached the&#10;side of my Dejah Thoris in no other way.&#10;&#10;Sheathing my bloody blade I advanced toward my Martian Princess, who&#10;still stood mutely gazing at me without sign of recognition.&#10;&#10;&quot;Who are you, Zodangan?&quot; she whispered.  &quot;Another enemy to harass me in&#10;my misery?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am a friend,&quot; I answered, &quot;a once cherished friend.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No friend of Helium's princess wears that metal,&quot; she replied, &quot;and&#10;yet the voice!  I have heard it before; it is not--it cannot be--no,&#10;for he is dead.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is, though, my Princess, none other than John Carter,&quot; I said.  &quot;Do&#10;you not recognize, even through paint and strange metal, the heart of&#10;your chieftain?&quot;&#10;&#10;As I came close to her she swayed toward me with outstretched hands,&#10;but as I reached to take her in my arms she drew back with a shudder&#10;and a little moan of misery.&#10;&#10;&quot;Too late, too late,&quot; she grieved.  &quot;O my chieftain that was, and whom&#10;I thought dead, had you but returned one little hour before--but now it&#10;is too late, too late.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What do you mean, Dejah Thoris?&quot; I cried.  &quot;That you would not have&#10;promised yourself to the Zodangan prince had you known that I lived?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Think you, John Carter, that I would give my heart to you yesterday&#10;and today to another?  I thought that it lay buried with your ashes in&#10;the pits of Warhoon, and so today I have promised my body to another to&#10;save my people from the curse of a victorious Zodangan army.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But I am not dead, my princess.  I have come to claim you, and all&#10;Zodanga cannot prevent it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is too late, John Carter, my promise is given, and on Barsoom that&#10;is final.  The ceremonies which follow later are but meaningless&#10;formalities.  They make the fact of marriage no more certain than does&#10;the funeral cortege of a jeddak again place the seal of death upon him.&#10;I am as good as married, John Carter.  No longer may you call me your&#10;princess.  No longer are you my chieftain.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I know but little of your customs here upon Barsoom, Dejah Thoris, but&#10;I do know that I love you, and if you meant the last words you spoke to&#10;me that day as the hordes of Warhoon were charging down upon us, no&#10;other man shall ever claim you as his bride.  You meant them then, my&#10;princess, and you mean them still!  Say that it is true.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I meant them, John Carter,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;I cannot repeat them now&#10;for I have given myself to another.  Ah, if you had only known our&#10;ways, my friend,&quot; she continued, half to herself, &quot;the promise would&#10;have been yours long months ago, and you could have claimed me before&#10;all others.  It might have meant the fall of Helium, but I would have&#10;given my empire for my Tharkian chief.&quot;&#10;&#10;Then aloud she said: &quot;Do you remember the night when you offended me?&#10;You called me your princess without having asked my hand of me, and&#10;then you boasted that you had fought for me.  You did not know, and I&#10;should not have been offended; I see that now.  But there was no one to&#10;tell you what I could not, that upon Barsoom there are two kinds of&#10;women in the cities of the red men.  The one they fight for that they&#10;may ask them in marriage; the other kind they fight for also, but never&#10;ask their hands.  When a man has won a woman he may address her as his&#10;princess, or in any of the several terms which signify possession.  You&#10;had fought for me, but had never asked me in marriage, and so when you&#10;called me your princess, you see,&quot; she faltered, &quot;I was hurt, but even&#10;then, John Carter, I did not repulse you, as I should have done, until&#10;you made it doubly worse by taunting me with having won me through&#10;combat.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I do not need ask your forgiveness now, Dejah Thoris,&quot; I cried.  &quot;You&#10;must know that my fault was of ignorance of your Barsoomian customs.&#10;What I failed to do, through implicit belief that my petition would be&#10;presumptuous and unwelcome, I do now, Dejah Thoris; I ask you to be my&#10;wife, and by all the Virginian fighting blood that flows in my veins&#10;you shall be.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, John Carter, it is useless,&quot; she cried, hopelessly, &quot;I may never&#10;be yours while Sab Than lives.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You have sealed his death warrant, my princess--Sab Than dies.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Nor that either,&quot; she hastened to explain.  &quot;I may not wed the man who&#10;slays my husband, even in self-defense.  It is custom.  We are ruled by&#10;custom upon Barsoom.  It is useless, my friend.  You must bear the&#10;sorrow with me.  That at least we may share in common.  That, and the&#10;memory of the brief days among the Tharks.  You must go now, nor ever&#10;see me again.  Good-bye, my chieftain that was.&quot;&#10;&#10;Disheartened and dejected, I withdrew from the room, but I was not&#10;entirely discouraged, nor would I admit that Dejah Thoris was lost to&#10;me until the ceremony had actually been performed.&#10;&#10;As I wandered along the corridors, I was as absolutely lost in the&#10;mazes of winding passageways as I had been before I discovered Dejah&#10;Thoris' apartments.&#10;&#10;I knew that my only hope lay in escape from the city of Zodanga, for&#10;the matter of the four dead guardsmen would have to be explained, and&#10;as I could never reach my original post without a guide, suspicion&#10;would surely rest on me so soon as I was discovered wandering aimlessly&#10;through the palace.&#10;&#10;Presently I came upon a spiral runway leading to a lower floor, and&#10;this I followed downward for several stories until I reached the&#10;doorway of a large apartment in which were a number of guardsmen.  The&#10;walls of this room were hung with transparent tapestries behind which I&#10;secreted myself without being apprehended.&#10;&#10;The conversation of the guardsmen was general, and awakened no interest&#10;in me until an officer entered the room and ordered four of the men to&#10;relieve the detail who were guarding the Princess of Helium.  Now, I&#10;knew, my troubles would commence in earnest and indeed they were upon&#10;me all too soon, for it seemed that the squad had scarcely left the&#10;guardroom before one of their number burst in again breathlessly,&#10;crying that they had found their four comrades butchered in the&#10;antechamber.&#10;&#10;In a moment the entire palace was alive with people.  Guardsmen,&#10;officers, courtiers, servants, and slaves ran helter-skelter through&#10;the corridors and apartments carrying messages and orders, and&#10;searching for signs of the assassin.&#10;&#10;This was my opportunity and slim as it appeared I grasped it, for as a&#10;number of soldiers came hurrying past my hiding place I fell in behind&#10;them and followed through the mazes of the palace until, in passing&#10;through a great hall, I saw the blessed light of day coming in through&#10;a series of larger windows.&#10;&#10;Here I left my guides, and, slipping to the nearest window, sought for&#10;an avenue of escape.  The windows opened upon a great balcony which&#10;overlooked one of the broad avenues of Zodanga.  The ground was about&#10;thirty feet below, and at a like distance from the building was a wall&#10;fully twenty feet high, constructed of polished glass about a foot in&#10;thickness.  To a red Martian escape by this path would have appeared&#10;impossible, but to me, with my earthly strength and agility, it seemed&#10;already accomplished.  My only fear was in being detected before&#10;darkness fell, for I could not make the leap in broad daylight while&#10;the court below and the avenue beyond were crowded with Zodangans.&#10;&#10;Accordingly I searched for a hiding place and finally found one by&#10;accident, inside a huge hanging ornament which swung from the ceiling&#10;of the hall, and about ten feet from the floor.  Into the capacious&#10;bowl-like vase I sprang with ease, and scarcely had I settled down&#10;within it than I heard a number of people enter the apartment.  The&#10;group stopped beneath my hiding place and I could plainly overhear&#10;their every word.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is the work of Heliumites,&quot; said one of the men.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, O Jeddak, but how had they access to the palace?  I could believe&#10;that even with the diligent care of your guardsmen a single enemy might&#10;reach the inner chambers, but how a force of six or eight fighting men&#10;could have done so unobserved is beyond me.  We shall soon know,&#10;however, for here comes the royal psychologist.&quot;&#10;&#10;Another man now joined the group, and, after making his formal&#10;greetings to his ruler, said:&#10;&#10;&quot;O mighty Jeddak, it is a strange tale I read in the dead minds of your&#10;faithful guardsmen.  They were felled not by a number of fighting men,&#10;but by a single opponent.&quot;&#10;&#10;He paused to let the full weight of this announcement impress his&#10;hearers, and that his statement was scarcely credited was evidenced by&#10;the impatient exclamation of incredulity which escaped the lips of Than&#10;Kosis.&#10;&#10;&quot;What manner of weird tale are you bringing me, Notan?&quot; he cried.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is the truth, my Jeddak,&quot; replied the psychologist.  &quot;In fact the&#10;impressions were strongly marked on the brain of each of the four&#10;guardsmen.  Their antagonist was a very tall man, wearing the metal of&#10;one of your own guardsmen, and his fighting ability was little short of&#10;marvelous for he fought fair against the entire four and vanquished&#10;them by his surpassing skill and superhuman strength and endurance.&#10;Though he wore the metal of Zodanga, my Jeddak, such a man was never&#10;seen before in this or any other country upon Barsoom.&#10;&#10;&quot;The mind of the Princess of Helium whom I have examined and questioned&#10;was a blank to me, she has perfect control, and I could not read one&#10;iota of it.  She said that she witnessed a portion of the encounter,&#10;and that when she looked there was but one man engaged with the&#10;guardsmen; a man whom she did not recognize as ever having seen.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Where is my erstwhile savior?&quot; spoke another of the party, and I&#10;recognized the voice of the cousin of Than Kosis, whom I had rescued&#10;from the green warriors.  &quot;By the metal of my first ancestor,&quot; he went&#10;on, &quot;but the description fits him to perfection, especially as to his&#10;fighting ability.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Where is this man?&quot; cried Than Kosis.  &quot;Have him brought to me at&#10;once.  What know you of him, cousin?  It seemed strange to me now that&#10;I think upon it that there should have been such a fighting man in&#10;Zodanga, of whose name, even, we were ignorant before today.  And his&#10;name too, John Carter, who ever heard of such a name upon Barsoom!&quot;&#10;&#10;Word was soon brought that I was nowhere to be found, either in the&#10;palace or at my former quarters in the barracks of the air-scout&#10;squadron.  Kantos Kan, they had found and questioned, but he knew&#10;nothing of my whereabouts, and as to my past, he had told them he knew&#10;as little, since he had but recently met me during our captivity among&#10;the Warhoons.&#10;&#10;&quot;Keep your eyes on this other one,&quot; commanded Than Kosis.  &quot;He also is&#10;a stranger and likely as not they both hail from Helium, and where one&#10;is we shall sooner or later find the other.  Quadruple the air patrol,&#10;and let every man who leaves the city by air or ground be subjected to&#10;the closest scrutiny.&quot;&#10;&#10;Another messenger now entered with word that I was still within the&#10;palace walls.&#10;&#10;&quot;The likeness of every person who has entered or left the palace&#10;grounds today has been carefully examined,&quot; concluded the fellow, &quot;and&#10;not one approaches the likeness of this new padwar of the guards, other&#10;than that which was recorded of him at the time he entered.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then we will have him shortly,&quot; commented Than Kosis contentedly, &quot;and&#10;in the meanwhile we will repair to the apartments of the Princess of&#10;Helium and question her in regard to the affair.  She may know more&#10;than she cared to divulge to you, Notan.  Come.&quot;&#10;&#10;They left the hall, and, as darkness had fallen without, I slipped&#10;lightly from my hiding place and hastened to the balcony.  Few were in&#10;sight, and choosing a moment when none seemed near I sprang quickly to&#10;the top of the glass wall and from there to the avenue beyond the&#10;palace grounds.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER XXIII&#10;&#10;LOST IN THE SKY&#10;&#10;&#10;Without effort at concealment I hastened to the vicinity of our&#10;quarters, where I felt sure I should find Kantos Kan.  As I neared the&#10;building I became more careful, as I judged, and rightly, that the&#10;place would be guarded.  Several men in civilian metal loitered near&#10;the front entrance and in the rear were others.  My only means of&#10;reaching, unseen, the upper story where our apartments were situated&#10;was through an adjoining building, and after considerable maneuvering I&#10;managed to attain the roof of a shop several doors away.&#10;&#10;Leaping from roof to roof, I soon reached an open window in the&#10;building where I hoped to find the Heliumite, and in another moment I&#10;stood in the room before him.  He was alone and showed no surprise at&#10;my coming, saying he had expected me much earlier, as my tour of duty&#10;must have ended some time since.&#10;&#10;I saw that he knew nothing of the events of the day at the palace, and&#10;when I had enlightened him he was all excitement.  The news that Dejah&#10;Thoris had promised her hand to Sab Than filled him with dismay.&#10;&#10;&quot;It cannot be,&quot; he exclaimed.  &quot;It is impossible!  Why no man in all&#10;Helium but would prefer death to the selling of our loved princess to&#10;the ruling house of Zodanga.  She must have lost her mind to have&#10;assented to such an atrocious bargain.  You, who do not know how we of&#10;Helium love the members of our ruling house, cannot appreciate the&#10;horror with which I contemplate such an unholy alliance.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What can be done, John Carter?&quot; he continued.  &quot;You are a resourceful&#10;man.  Can you not think of some way to save Helium from this disgrace?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;If I can come within sword's reach of Sab Than,&quot; I answered, &quot;I can&#10;solve the difficulty in so far as Helium is concerned, but for personal&#10;reasons I would prefer that another struck the blow that frees Dejah&#10;Thoris.&quot;&#10;&#10;Kantos Kan eyed me narrowly before he spoke.&#10;&#10;&quot;You love her!&quot; he said.  &quot;Does she know it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She knows it, Kantos Kan, and repulses me only because she is promised&#10;to Sab Than.&quot;&#10;&#10;The splendid fellow sprang to his feet, and grasping me by the shoulder&#10;raised his sword on high, exclaiming:&#10;&#10;&quot;And had the choice been left to me I could not have chosen a more&#10;fitting mate for the first princess of Barsoom.  Here is my hand upon&#10;your shoulder, John Carter, and my word that Sab Than shall go out at&#10;the point of my sword for the sake of my love for Helium, for Dejah&#10;Thoris, and for you.  This very night I shall try to reach his quarters&#10;in the palace.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How?&quot; I asked.  &quot;You are strongly guarded and a quadruple force&#10;patrols the sky.&quot;&#10;&#10;He bent his head in thought a moment, then raised it with an air of&#10;confidence.&#10;&#10;&quot;I only need to pass these guards and I can do it,&quot; he said at last.&#10;&quot;I know a secret entrance to the palace through the pinnacle of the&#10;highest tower.  I fell upon it by chance one day as I was passing above&#10;the palace on patrol duty.  In this work it is required that we&#10;investigate any unusual occurrence we may witness, and a face peering&#10;from the pinnacle of the high tower of the palace was, to me, most&#10;unusual.  I therefore drew near and discovered that the possessor of&#10;the peering face was none other than Sab Than.  He was slightly put out&#10;at being detected and commanded me to keep the matter to myself,&#10;explaining that the passage from the tower led directly to his&#10;apartments, and was known only to him.  If I can reach the roof of the&#10;barracks and get my machine I can be in Sab Than's quarters in five&#10;minutes; but how am I to escape from this building, guarded as you say&#10;it is?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How well are the machine sheds at the barracks guarded?&quot; I asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;There is usually but one man on duty there at night upon the roof.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Go to the roof of this building, Kantos Kan, and wait me there.&quot;&#10;&#10;Without stopping to explain my plans I retraced my way to the street&#10;and hastened to the barracks.  I did not dare to enter the building,&#10;filled as it was with members of the air-scout squadron, who, in common&#10;with all Zodanga, were on the lookout for me.&#10;&#10;The building was an enormous one, rearing its lofty head fully a&#10;thousand feet into the air.  But few buildings in Zodanga were higher&#10;than these barracks, though several topped it by a few hundred feet;&#10;the docks of the great battleships of the line standing some fifteen&#10;hundred feet from the ground, while the freight and passenger stations&#10;of the merchant squadrons rose nearly as high.&#10;&#10;It was a long climb up the face of the building, and one fraught with&#10;much danger, but there was no other way, and so I essayed the task.&#10;The fact that Barsoomian architecture is extremely ornate made the feat&#10;much simpler than I had anticipated, since I found ornamental ledges&#10;and projections which fairly formed a perfect ladder for me all the way&#10;to the eaves of the building.  Here I met my first real obstacle.  The&#10;eaves projected nearly twenty feet from the wall to which I clung, and&#10;though I encircled the great building I could find no opening through&#10;them.&#10;&#10;The top floor was alight, and filled with soldiers engaged in the&#10;pastimes of their kind; I could not, therefore, reach the roof through&#10;the building.&#10;&#10;There was one slight, desperate chance, and that I decided I must&#10;take--it was for Dejah Thoris, and no man has lived who would not risk&#10;a thousand deaths for such as she.&#10;&#10;Clinging to the wall with my feet and one hand, I unloosened one of the&#10;long leather straps of my trappings at the end of which dangled a great&#10;hook by which air sailors are hung to the sides and bottoms of their&#10;craft for various purposes of repair, and by means of which landing&#10;parties are lowered to the ground from the battleships.&#10;&#10;I swung this hook cautiously to the roof several times before it&#10;finally found lodgment; gently I pulled on it to strengthen its hold,&#10;but whether it would bear the weight of my body I did not know.  It&#10;might be barely caught upon the very outer verge of the roof, so that&#10;as my body swung out at the end of the strap it would slip off and&#10;launch me to the pavement a thousand feet below.&#10;&#10;An instant I hesitated, and then, releasing my grasp upon the&#10;supporting ornament, I swung out into space at the end of the strap.&#10;Far below me lay the brilliantly lighted streets, the hard pavements,&#10;and death.  There was a little jerk at the top of the supporting eaves,&#10;and a nasty slipping, grating sound which turned me cold with&#10;apprehension; then the hook caught and I was safe.&#10;&#10;Clambering quickly aloft I grasped the edge of the eaves and drew&#10;myself to the surface of the roof above.  As I gained my feet I was&#10;confronted by the sentry on duty, into the muzzle of whose revolver I&#10;found myself looking.&#10;&#10;&quot;Who are you and whence came you?&quot; he cried.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am an air scout, friend, and very near a dead one, for just by the&#10;merest chance I escaped falling to the avenue below,&quot; I replied.&#10;&#10;&quot;But how came you upon the roof, man?  No one has landed or come up&#10;from the building for the past hour.  Quick, explain yourself, or I&#10;call the guard.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Look you here, sentry, and you shall see how I came and how close a&#10;shave I had to not coming at all,&quot; I answered, turning toward the edge&#10;of the roof, where, twenty feet below, at the end of my strap, hung all&#10;my weapons.&#10;&#10;The fellow, acting on impulse of curiosity, stepped to my side and to&#10;his undoing, for as he leaned to peer over the eaves I grasped him by&#10;his throat and his pistol arm and threw him heavily to the roof.  The&#10;weapon dropped from his grasp, and my fingers choked off his attempted&#10;cry for assistance.  I gagged and bound him and then hung him over the&#10;edge of the roof as I myself had hung a few moments before.  I knew it&#10;would be morning before he would be discovered, and I needed all the&#10;time that I could gain.&#10;&#10;Donning my trappings and weapons I hastened to the sheds, and soon had&#10;out both my machine and Kantos Kan's.  Making his fast behind mine I&#10;started my engine, and skimming over the edge of the roof I dove down&#10;into the streets of the city far below the plane usually occupied by&#10;the air patrol.  In less than a minute I was settling safely upon the&#10;roof of our apartment beside the astonished Kantos Kan.&#10;&#10;I lost no time in explanation, but plunged immediately into a&#10;discussion of our plans for the immediate future.  It was decided that&#10;I was to try to make Helium while Kantos Kan was to enter the palace&#10;and dispatch Sab Than.  If successful he was then to follow me.  He set&#10;my compass for me, a clever little device which will remain steadfastly&#10;fixed upon any given point on the surface of Barsoom, and bidding each&#10;other farewell we rose together and sped in the direction of the palace&#10;which lay in the route which I must take to reach Helium.&#10;&#10;As we neared the high tower a patrol shot down from above, throwing its&#10;piercing searchlight full upon my craft, and a voice roared out a&#10;command to halt, following with a shot as I paid no attention to his&#10;hail.  Kantos Kan dropped quickly into the darkness, while I rose&#10;steadily and at terrific speed raced through the Martian sky followed&#10;by a dozen of the air-scout craft which had joined the pursuit, and&#10;later by a swift cruiser carrying a hundred men and a battery of&#10;rapid-fire guns.  By twisting and turning my little machine, now rising&#10;and now falling, I managed to elude their search-lights most of the&#10;time, but I was also losing ground by these tactics, and so I decided&#10;to hazard everything on a straight-away course and leave the result to&#10;fate and the speed of my machine.&#10;&#10;Kantos Kan had shown me a trick of gearing, which is known only to the&#10;navy of Helium, that greatly increased the speed of our machines, so&#10;that I felt sure I could distance my pursuers if I could dodge their&#10;projectiles for a few moments.&#10;&#10;As I sped through the air the screeching of the bullets around me&#10;convinced me that only by a miracle could I escape, but the die was&#10;cast, and throwing on full speed I raced a straight course toward&#10;Helium.  Gradually I left my pursuers further and further behind, and I&#10;was just congratulating myself on my lucky escape, when a well-directed&#10;shot from the cruiser exploded at the prow of my little craft.  The&#10;concussion nearly capsized her, and with a sickening plunge she hurtled&#10;downward through the dark night.&#10;&#10;How far I fell before I regained control of the plane I do not know,&#10;but I must have been very close to the ground when I started to rise&#10;again, as I plainly heard the squealing of animals below me.  Rising&#10;again I scanned the heavens for my pursuers, and finally making out&#10;their lights far behind me, saw that they were landing, evidently in&#10;search of me.&#10;&#10;Not until their lights were no longer discernible did I venture to&#10;flash my little lamp upon my compass, and then I found to my&#10;consternation that a fragment of the projectile had utterly destroyed&#10;my only guide, as well as my speedometer.  It was true I could follow&#10;the stars in the general direction of Helium, but without knowing the&#10;exact location of the city or the speed at which I was traveling my&#10;chances for finding it were slim.&#10;&#10;Helium lies a thousand miles southwest of Zodanga, and with my compass&#10;intact I should have made the trip, barring accidents, in between four&#10;and five hours.  As it turned out, however, morning found me speeding&#10;over a vast expanse of dead sea bottom after nearly six hours of&#10;continuous flight at high speed.  Presently a great city showed below&#10;me, but it was not Helium, as that alone of all Barsoomian metropolises&#10;consists in two immense circular walled cities about seventy-five miles&#10;apart and would have been easily distinguishable from the altitude at&#10;which I was flying.&#10;&#10;Believing that I had come too far to the north and west, I turned back&#10;in a southeasterly direction, passing during the forenoon several other&#10;large cities, but none resembling the description which Kantos Kan had&#10;given me of Helium.  In addition to the twin-city formation of Helium,&#10;another distinguishing feature is the two immense towers, one of vivid&#10;scarlet rising nearly a mile into the air from the center of one of the&#10;cities, while the other, of bright yellow and of the same height, marks&#10;her sister.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER XXIV&#10;&#10;TARS TARKAS FINDS A FRIEND&#10;&#10;&#10;About noon I passed low over a great dead city of ancient Mars, and as&#10;I skimmed out across the plain beyond I came full upon several thousand&#10;green warriors engaged in a terrific battle.  Scarcely had I seen them&#10;than a volley of shots was directed at me, and with the almost&#10;unfailing accuracy of their aim my little craft was instantly a ruined&#10;wreck, sinking erratically to the ground.&#10;&#10;I fell almost directly in the center of the fierce combat, among&#10;warriors who had not seen my approach so busily were they engaged in&#10;life and death struggles.  The men were fighting on foot with&#10;long-swords, while an occasional shot from a sharpshooter on the&#10;outskirts of the conflict would bring down a warrior who might for an&#10;instant separate himself from the entangled mass.&#10;&#10;As my machine sank among them I realized that it was fight or die, with&#10;good chances of dying in any event, and so I struck the ground with&#10;drawn long-sword ready to defend myself as I could.&#10;&#10;I fell beside a huge monster who was engaged with three antagonists,&#10;and as I glanced at his fierce face, filled with the light of battle, I&#10;recognized Tars Tarkas the Thark.  He did not see me, as I was a trifle&#10;behind him, and just then the three warriors opposing him, and whom I&#10;recognized as Warhoons, charged simultaneously.  The mighty fellow made&#10;quick work of one of them, but in stepping back for another thrust he&#10;fell over a dead body behind him and was down and at the mercy of his&#10;foes in an instant.  Quick as lightning they were upon him, and Tars&#10;Tarkas would have been gathered to his fathers in short order had I not&#10;sprung before his prostrate form and engaged his adversaries.  I had&#10;accounted for one of them when the mighty Thark regained his feet and&#10;quickly settled the other.&#10;&#10;He gave me one look, and a slight smile touched his grim lip as,&#10;touching my shoulder, he said,&#10;&#10;&quot;I would scarcely recognize you, John Carter, but there is no other&#10;mortal upon Barsoom who would have done what you have for me.  I think&#10;I have learned that there is such a thing as friendship, my friend.&quot;&#10;&#10;He said no more, nor was there opportunity, for the Warhoons were&#10;closing in about us, and together we fought, shoulder to shoulder,&#10;during all that long, hot afternoon, until the tide of battle turned&#10;and the remnant of the fierce Warhoon horde fell back upon their&#10;thoats, and fled into the gathering darkness.&#10;&#10;Ten thousand men had been engaged in that titanic struggle, and upon&#10;the field of battle lay three thousand dead.  Neither side asked or&#10;gave quarter, nor did they attempt to take prisoners.&#10;&#10;On our return to the city after the battle we had gone directly to Tars&#10;Tarkas' quarters, where I was left alone while the chieftain attended&#10;the customary council which immediately follows an engagement.&#10;&#10;As I sat awaiting the return of the green warrior I heard something&#10;move in an adjoining apartment, and as I glanced up there rushed&#10;suddenly upon me a huge and hideous creature which bore me backward&#10;upon the pile of silks and furs upon which I had been reclining.  It&#10;was Woola--faithful, loving Woola.  He had found his way back to Thark&#10;and, as Tars Tarkas later told me, had gone immediately to my former&#10;quarters where he had taken up his pathetic and seemingly hopeless&#10;watch for my return.&#10;&#10;&quot;Tal Hajus knows that you are here, John Carter,&quot; said Tars Tarkas, on&#10;his return from the jeddak's quarters; &quot;Sarkoja saw and recognized you&#10;as we were returning.  Tal Hajus has ordered me to bring you before him&#10;tonight.  I have ten thoats, John Carter; you may take your choice from&#10;among them, and I will accompany you to the nearest waterway that leads&#10;to Helium.  Tars Tarkas may be a cruel green warrior, but he can be a&#10;friend as well.  Come, we must start.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And when you return, Tars Tarkas?&quot; I asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;The wild calots, possibly, or worse,&quot; he replied.  &quot;Unless I should&#10;chance to have the opportunity I have so long waited of battling with&#10;Tal Hajus.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We will stay, Tars Tarkas, and see Tal Hajus tonight.  You shall not&#10;sacrifice yourself, and it may be that tonight you can have the chance&#10;you wait.&quot;&#10;&#10;He objected strenuously, saying that Tal Hajus often flew into wild&#10;fits of passion at the mere thought of the blow I had dealt him, and&#10;that if ever he laid his hands upon me I would be subjected to the most&#10;horrible tortures.&#10;&#10;While we were eating I repeated to Tars Tarkas the story which Sola had&#10;told me that night upon the sea bottom during the march to Thark.&#10;&#10;He said but little, but the great muscles of his face worked in passion&#10;and in agony at recollection of the horrors which had been heaped upon&#10;the only thing he had ever loved in all his cold, cruel, terrible&#10;existence.&#10;&#10;He no longer demurred when I suggested that we go before Tal Hajus,&#10;only saying that he would like to speak to Sarkoja first.  At his&#10;request I accompanied him to her quarters, and the look of venomous&#10;hatred she cast upon me was almost adequate recompense for any future&#10;misfortunes this accidental return to Thark might bring me.&#10;&#10;&quot;Sarkoja,&quot; said Tars Tarkas, &quot;forty years ago you were instrumental in&#10;bringing about the torture and death of a woman named Gozava.  I have&#10;just discovered that the warrior who loved that woman has learned of&#10;your part in the transaction.  He may not kill you, Sarkoja, it is not&#10;our custom, but there is nothing to prevent him tying one end of a&#10;strap about your neck and the other end to a wild thoat, merely to test&#10;your fitness to survive and help perpetuate our race.  Having heard&#10;that he would do this on the morrow, I thought it only right to warn&#10;you, for I am a just man.  The river Iss is but a short pilgrimage,&#10;Sarkoja.  Come, John Carter.&quot;&#10;&#10;The next morning Sarkoja was gone, nor was she ever seen after.&#10;&#10;In silence we hastened to the jeddak's palace, where we were&#10;immediately admitted to his presence; in fact, he could scarcely wait&#10;to see me and was standing erect upon his platform glowering at the&#10;entrance as I came in.&#10;&#10;&quot;Strap him to that pillar,&quot; he shrieked.  &quot;We shall see who it is dares&#10;strike the mighty Tal Hajus.  Heat the irons; with my own hands I shall&#10;burn the eyes from his head that he may not pollute my person with his&#10;vile gaze.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Chieftains of Thark,&quot; I cried, turning to the assembled council and&#10;ignoring Tal Hajus, &quot;I have been a chief among you, and today I have&#10;fought for Thark shoulder to shoulder with her greatest warrior.  You&#10;owe me, at least, a hearing.  I have won that much today.  You claim to&#10;be just people--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Silence,&quot; roared Tal Hajus.  &quot;Gag the creature and bind him as I&#10;command.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Justice, Tal Hajus,&quot; exclaimed Lorquas Ptomel.  &quot;Who are you to set&#10;aside the customs of ages among the Tharks.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, justice!&quot; echoed a dozen voices, and so, while Tal Hajus fumed&#10;and frothed, I continued.&#10;&#10;&quot;You are a brave people and you love bravery, but where was your mighty&#10;jeddak during the fighting today?  I did not see him in the thick of&#10;battle; he was not there.  He rends defenseless women and little&#10;children in his lair, but how recently has one of you seen him fight&#10;with men?  Why, even I, a midget beside him, felled him with a single&#10;blow of my fist.  Is it of such that the Tharks fashion their jeddaks?&#10;There stands beside me now a great Thark, a mighty warrior and a noble&#10;man.  Chieftains, how sounds, Tars Tarkas, Jeddak of Thark?&quot;&#10;&#10;A roar of deep-toned applause greeted this suggestion.&#10;&#10;&quot;It but remains for this council to command, and Tal Hajus must prove&#10;his fitness to rule.  Were he a brave man he would invite Tars Tarkas&#10;to combat, for he does not love him, but Tal Hajus is afraid; Tal&#10;Hajus, your jeddak, is a coward.  With my bare hands I could kill him,&#10;and he knows it.&quot;&#10;&#10;After I ceased there was tense silence, as all eyes were riveted upon&#10;Tal Hajus.  He did not speak or move, but the blotchy green of his&#10;countenance turned livid, and the froth froze upon his lips.&#10;&#10;&quot;Tal Hajus,&quot; said Lorquas Ptomel in a cold, hard voice, &quot;never in my&#10;long life have I seen a jeddak of the Tharks so humiliated.  There&#10;could be but one answer to this arraignment.  We wait it.&quot;  And still&#10;Tal Hajus stood as though petrified.&#10;&#10;&quot;Chieftains,&quot; continued Lorquas Ptomel, &quot;shall the jeddak, Tal Hajus,&#10;prove his fitness to rule over Tars Tarkas?&quot;&#10;&#10;There were twenty chieftains about the rostrum, and twenty swords&#10;flashed high in assent.&#10;&#10;There was no alternative.  That decree was final, and so Tal Hajus drew&#10;his long-sword and advanced to meet Tars Tarkas.&#10;&#10;The combat was soon over, and, with his foot upon the neck of the dead&#10;monster, Tars Tarkas became jeddak among the Tharks.&#10;&#10;His first act was to make me a full-fledged chieftain with the rank I&#10;had won by my combats the first few weeks of my captivity among them.&#10;&#10;Seeing the favorable disposition of the warriors toward Tars Tarkas, as&#10;well as toward me, I grasped the opportunity to enlist them in my cause&#10;against Zodanga.  I told Tars Tarkas the story of my adventures, and in&#10;a few words had explained to him the thought I had in mind.&#10;&#10;&quot;John Carter has made a proposal,&quot; he said, addressing the council,&#10;&quot;which meets with my sanction.  I shall put it to you briefly.  Dejah&#10;Thoris, the Princess of Helium, who was our prisoner, is now held by&#10;the jeddak of Zodanga, whose son she must wed to save her country from&#10;devastation at the hands of the Zodangan forces.&#10;&#10;&quot;John Carter suggests that we rescue her and return her to Helium.  The&#10;loot of Zodanga would be magnificent, and I have often thought that had&#10;we an alliance with the people of Helium we could obtain sufficient&#10;assurance of sustenance to permit us to increase the size and frequency&#10;of our hatchings, and thus become unquestionably supreme among the&#10;green men of all Barsoom.  What say you?&quot;&#10;&#10;It was a chance to fight, an opportunity to loot, and they rose to the&#10;bait as a speckled trout to a fly.&#10;&#10;For Tharks they were wildly enthusiastic, and before another half hour&#10;had passed twenty mounted messengers were speeding across dead sea&#10;bottoms to call the hordes together for the expedition.&#10;&#10;In three days we were on the march toward Zodanga, one hundred thousand&#10;strong, as Tars Tarkas had been able to enlist the services of three&#10;smaller hordes on the promise of the great loot of Zodanga.&#10;&#10;At the head of the column I rode beside the great Thark while at the&#10;heels of my mount trotted my beloved Woola.&#10;&#10;We traveled entirely by night, timing our marches so that we camped&#10;during the day at deserted cities where, even to the beasts, we were&#10;all kept indoors during the daylight hours.  On the march Tars Tarkas,&#10;through his remarkable ability and statesmanship, enlisted fifty&#10;thousand more warriors from various hordes, so that, ten days after we&#10;set out we halted at midnight outside the great walled city of Zodanga,&#10;one hundred and fifty thousand strong.&#10;&#10;The fighting strength and efficiency of this horde of ferocious green&#10;monsters was equivalent to ten times their number of red men.  Never in&#10;the history of Barsoom, Tars Tarkas told me, had such a force of green&#10;warriors marched to battle together.  It was a monstrous task to keep&#10;even a semblance of harmony among them, and it was a marvel to me that&#10;he got them to the city without a mighty battle among themselves.&#10;&#10;But as we neared Zodanga their personal quarrels were submerged by&#10;their greater hatred for the red men, and especially for the Zodangans,&#10;who had for years waged a ruthless campaign of extermination against&#10;the green men, directing special attention toward despoiling their&#10;incubators.&#10;&#10;Now that we were before Zodanga the task of obtaining entry to the city&#10;devolved upon me, and directing Tars Tarkas to hold his forces in two&#10;divisions out of earshot of the city, with each division opposite a&#10;large gateway, I took twenty dismounted warriors and approached one of&#10;the small gates that pierced the walls at short intervals.  These gates&#10;have no regular guard, but are covered by sentries, who patrol the&#10;avenue that encircles the city just within the walls as our&#10;metropolitan police patrol their beats.&#10;&#10;The walls of Zodanga are seventy-five feet in height and fifty feet&#10;thick.  They are built of enormous blocks of carborundum, and the task&#10;of entering the city seemed, to my escort of green warriors, an&#10;impossibility.  The fellows who had been detailed to accompany me were&#10;of one of the smaller hordes, and therefore did not know me.&#10;&#10;Placing three of them with their faces to the wall and arms locked, I&#10;commanded two more to mount to their shoulders, and a sixth I ordered&#10;to climb upon the shoulders of the upper two.  The head of the topmost&#10;warrior towered over forty feet from the ground.&#10;&#10;In this way, with ten warriors, I built a series of three steps from&#10;the ground to the shoulders of the topmost man.  Then starting from a&#10;short distance behind them I ran swiftly up from one tier to the next,&#10;and with a final bound from the broad shoulders of the highest I&#10;clutched the top of the great wall and quietly drew myself to its broad&#10;expanse.  After me I dragged six lengths of leather from an equal&#10;number of my warriors.  These lengths we had previously fastened&#10;together, and passing one end to the topmost warrior I lowered the&#10;other end cautiously over the opposite side of the wall toward the&#10;avenue below.  No one was in sight, so, lowering myself to the end of&#10;my leather strap, I dropped the remaining thirty feet to the pavement&#10;below.&#10;&#10;I had learned from Kantos Kan the secret of opening these gates, and in&#10;another moment my twenty great fighting men stood within the doomed&#10;city of Zodanga.&#10;&#10;I found to my delight that I had entered at the lower boundary of the&#10;enormous palace grounds.  The building itself showed in the distance a&#10;blaze of glorious light, and on the instant I determined to lead a&#10;detachment of warriors directly within the palace itself, while the&#10;balance of the great horde was attacking the barracks of the soldiery.&#10;&#10;Dispatching one of my men to Tars Tarkas for a detail of fifty Tharks,&#10;with word of my intentions, I ordered ten warriors to capture and open&#10;one of the great gates while with the nine remaining I took the other.&#10;We were to do our work quietly, no shots were to be fired and no&#10;general advance made until I had reached the palace with my fifty&#10;Tharks.  Our plans worked to perfection.  The two sentries we met were&#10;dispatched to their fathers upon the banks of the lost sea of Korus,&#10;and the guards at both gates followed them in silence.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER XXV&#10;&#10;THE LOOTING OF ZODANGA&#10;&#10;&#10;As the great gate where I stood swung open my fifty Tharks, headed by&#10;Tars Tarkas himself, rode in upon their mighty thoats.  I led them to&#10;the palace walls, which I negotiated easily without assistance.  Once&#10;inside, however, the gate gave me considerable trouble, but I finally&#10;was rewarded by seeing it swing upon its huge hinges, and soon my&#10;fierce escort was riding across the gardens of the jeddak of Zodanga.&#10;&#10;As we approached the palace I could see through the great windows of&#10;the first floor into the brilliantly illuminated audience chamber of&#10;Than Kosis.  The immense hall was crowded with nobles and their women,&#10;as though some important function was in progress.  There was not a&#10;guard in sight without the palace, due, I presume, to the fact that the&#10;city and palace walls were considered impregnable, and so I came close&#10;and peered within.&#10;&#10;At one end of the chamber, upon massive golden thrones encrusted with&#10;diamonds, sat Than Kosis and his consort, surrounded by officers and&#10;dignitaries of state.  Before them stretched a broad aisle lined on&#10;either side with soldiery, and as I looked there entered this aisle at&#10;the far end of the hall, the head of a procession which advanced to the&#10;foot of the throne.&#10;&#10;First there marched four officers of the jeddak's Guard bearing a huge&#10;salver on which reposed, upon a cushion of scarlet silk, a great golden&#10;chain with a collar and padlock at each end.  Directly behind these&#10;officers came four others carrying a similar salver which supported the&#10;magnificent ornaments of a prince and princess of the reigning house of&#10;Zodanga.&#10;&#10;At the foot of the throne these two parties separated and halted,&#10;facing each other at opposite sides of the aisle.  Then came more&#10;dignitaries, and the officers of the palace and of the army, and&#10;finally two figures entirely muffled in scarlet silk, so that not a&#10;feature of either was discernible.  These two stopped at the foot of&#10;the throne, facing Than Kosis.  When the balance of the procession had&#10;entered and assumed their stations Than Kosis addressed the couple&#10;standing before him.  I could not hear his words, but presently two&#10;officers advanced and removed the scarlet robe from one of the figures,&#10;and I saw that Kantos Kan had failed in his mission, for it was Sab&#10;Than, Prince of Zodanga, who stood revealed before me.&#10;&#10;Than Kosis now took a set of the ornaments from one of the salvers and&#10;placed one of the collars of gold about his son's neck, springing the&#10;padlock fast.  After a few more words addressed to Sab Than he turned&#10;to the other figure, from which the officers now removed the&#10;enshrouding silks, disclosing to my now comprehending view Dejah&#10;Thoris, Princess of Helium.&#10;&#10;The object of the ceremony was clear to me; in another moment Dejah&#10;Thoris would be joined forever to the Prince of Zodanga.  It was an&#10;impressive and beautiful ceremony, I presume, but to me it seemed the&#10;most fiendish sight I had ever witnessed, and as the ornaments were&#10;adjusted upon her beautiful figure and her collar of gold swung open in&#10;the hands of Than Kosis I raised my long-sword above my head, and, with&#10;the heavy hilt, I shattered the glass of the great window and sprang&#10;into the midst of the astonished assemblage.  With a bound I was on the&#10;steps of the platform beside Than Kosis, and as he stood riveted with&#10;surprise I brought my long-sword down upon the golden chain that would&#10;have bound Dejah Thoris to another.&#10;&#10;In an instant all was confusion; a thousand drawn swords menaced me&#10;from every quarter, and Sab Than sprang upon me with a jeweled dagger&#10;he had drawn from his nuptial ornaments.  I could have killed him as&#10;easily as I might a fly, but the age-old custom of Barsoom stayed my&#10;hand, and grasping his wrist as the dagger flew toward my heart I held&#10;him as though in a vise and with my long-sword pointed to the far end&#10;of the hall.&#10;&#10;&quot;Zodanga has fallen,&quot; I cried.  &quot;Look!&quot;&#10;&#10;All eyes turned in the direction I had indicated, and there, forging&#10;through the portals of the entranceway rode Tars Tarkas and his fifty&#10;warriors on their great thoats.&#10;&#10;A cry of alarm and amazement broke from the assemblage, but no word of&#10;fear, and in a moment the soldiers and nobles of Zodanga were hurling&#10;themselves upon the advancing Tharks.&#10;&#10;Thrusting Sab Than headlong from the platform, I drew Dejah Thoris to&#10;my side.  Behind the throne was a narrow doorway and in this Than Kosis&#10;now stood facing me, with drawn long-sword.  In an instant we were&#10;engaged, and I found no mean antagonist.&#10;&#10;As we circled upon the broad platform I saw Sab Than rushing up the&#10;steps to aid his father, but, as he raised his hand to strike, Dejah&#10;Thoris sprang before him and then my sword found the spot that made Sab&#10;Than jeddak of Zodanga.  As his father rolled dead upon the floor the&#10;new jeddak tore himself free from Dejah Thoris' grasp, and again we&#10;faced each other.  He was soon joined by a quartet of officers, and,&#10;with my back against a golden throne, I fought once again for Dejah&#10;Thoris.  I was hard pressed to defend myself and yet not strike down&#10;Sab Than and, with him, my last chance to win the woman I loved.  My&#10;blade was swinging with the rapidity of lightning as I sought to parry&#10;the thrusts and cuts of my opponents.  Two I had disarmed, and one was&#10;down, when several more rushed to the aid of their new ruler, and to&#10;avenge the death of the old.&#10;&#10;As they advanced there were cries of &quot;The woman!  The woman!  Strike&#10;her down; it is her plot.  Kill her!  Kill her!&quot;&#10;&#10;Calling to Dejah Thoris to get behind me I worked my way toward the&#10;little doorway back of the throne, but the officers realized my&#10;intentions, and three of them sprang in behind me and blocked my&#10;chances for gaining a position where I could have defended Dejah Thoris&#10;against an army of swordsmen.&#10;&#10;The Tharks were having their hands full in the center of the room, and&#10;I began to realize that nothing short of a miracle could save Dejah&#10;Thoris and myself, when I saw Tars Tarkas surging through the crowd of&#10;pygmies that swarmed about him.  With one swing of his mighty longsword&#10;he laid a dozen corpses at his feet, and so he hewed a pathway before&#10;him until in another moment he stood upon the platform beside me,&#10;dealing death and destruction right and left.&#10;&#10;The bravery of the Zodangans was awe-inspiring, not one attempted to&#10;escape, and when the fighting ceased it was because only Tharks&#10;remained alive in the great hall, other than Dejah Thoris and myself.&#10;&#10;Sab Than lay dead beside his father, and the corpses of the flower of&#10;Zodangan nobility and chivalry covered the floor of the bloody shambles.&#10;&#10;My first thought when the battle was over was for Kantos Kan, and&#10;leaving Dejah Thoris in charge of Tars Tarkas I took a dozen warriors&#10;and hastened to the dungeons beneath the palace.  The jailers had all&#10;left to join the fighters in the throne room, so we searched the&#10;labyrinthine prison without opposition.&#10;&#10;I called Kantos Kan's name aloud in each new corridor and compartment,&#10;and finally I was rewarded by hearing a faint response.  Guided by the&#10;sound, we soon found him helpless in a dark recess.&#10;&#10;He was overjoyed at seeing me, and to know the meaning of the fight,&#10;faint echoes of which had reached his prison cell.  He told me that the&#10;air patrol had captured him before he reached the high tower of the&#10;palace, so that he had not even seen Sab Than.&#10;&#10;We discovered that it would be futile to attempt to cut away the bars&#10;and chains which held him prisoner, so, at his suggestion I returned to&#10;search the bodies on the floor above for keys to open the padlocks of&#10;his cell and of his chains.&#10;&#10;Fortunately among the first I examined I found his jailer, and soon we&#10;had Kantos Kan with us in the throne room.&#10;&#10;The sounds of heavy firing, mingled with shouts and cries, came to us&#10;from the city's streets, and Tars Tarkas hastened away to direct the&#10;fighting without.  Kantos Kan accompanied him to act as guide, the&#10;green warriors commencing a thorough search of the palace for other&#10;Zodangans and for loot, and Dejah Thoris and I were left alone.&#10;&#10;She had sunk into one of the golden thrones, and as I turned to her she&#10;greeted me with a wan smile.&#10;&#10;&quot;Was there ever such a man!&quot; she exclaimed.  &quot;I know that Barsoom has&#10;never before seen your like.  Can it be that all Earth men are as you?&#10;Alone, a stranger, hunted, threatened, persecuted, you have done in a&#10;few short months what in all the past ages of Barsoom no man has ever&#10;done: joined together the wild hordes of the sea bottoms and brought&#10;them to fight as allies of a red Martian people.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The answer is easy, Dejah Thoris,&quot; I replied smiling.  &quot;It was not I&#10;who did it, it was love, love for Dejah Thoris, a power that would work&#10;greater miracles than this you have seen.&quot;&#10;&#10;A pretty flush overspread her face and she answered,&#10;&#10;&quot;You may say that now, John Carter, and I may listen, for I am free.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And more still I have to say, ere it is again too late,&quot; I returned.&#10;&quot;I have done many strange things in my life, many things that wiser men&#10;would not have dared, but never in my wildest fancies have I dreamed of&#10;winning a Dejah Thoris for myself--for never had I dreamed that in all&#10;the universe dwelt such a woman as the Princess of Helium.  That you&#10;are a princess does not abash me, but that you are you is enough to&#10;make me doubt my sanity as I ask you, my princess, to be mine.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He does not need to be abashed who so well knew the answer to his plea&#10;before the plea were made,&quot; she replied, rising and placing her dear&#10;hands upon my shoulders, and so I took her in my arms and kissed her.&#10;&#10;And thus in the midst of a city of wild conflict, filled with the&#10;alarms of war; with death and destruction reaping their terrible&#10;harvest around her, did Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium, true daughter&#10;of Mars, the God of War, promise herself in marriage to John Carter,&#10;Gentleman of Virginia.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER XXVI&#10;&#10;THROUGH CARNAGE TO JOY&#10;&#10;&#10;Sometime later Tars Tarkas and Kantos Kan returned to report that&#10;Zodanga had been completely reduced.  Her forces were entirely&#10;destroyed or captured, and no further resistance was to be expected&#10;from within.  Several battleships had escaped, but there were thousands&#10;of war and merchant vessels under guard of Thark warriors.&#10;&#10;The lesser hordes had commenced looting and quarreling among&#10;themselves, so it was decided that we collect what warriors we could,&#10;man as many vessels as possible with Zodangan prisoners and make for&#10;Helium without further loss of time.&#10;&#10;Five hours later we sailed from the roofs of the dock buildings with a&#10;fleet of two hundred and fifty battleships, carrying nearly one hundred&#10;thousand green warriors, followed by a fleet of transports with our&#10;thoats.&#10;&#10;Behind us we left the stricken city in the fierce and brutal clutches&#10;of some forty thousand green warriors of the lesser hordes.  They were&#10;looting, murdering, and fighting amongst themselves.  In a hundred&#10;places they had applied the torch, and columns of dense smoke were&#10;rising above the city as though to blot out from the eye of heaven the&#10;horrid sights beneath.&#10;&#10;In the middle of the afternoon we sighted the scarlet and yellow towers&#10;of Helium, and a short time later a great fleet of Zodangan battleships&#10;rose from the camps of the besiegers without the city, and advanced to&#10;meet us.&#10;&#10;The banners of Helium had been strung from stem to stern of each of our&#10;mighty craft, but the Zodangans did not need this sign to realize that&#10;we were enemies, for our green Martian warriors had opened fire upon&#10;them almost as they left the ground.  With their uncanny marksmanship&#10;they raked the on-coming fleet with volley after volley.&#10;&#10;The twin cities of Helium, perceiving that we were friends, sent out&#10;hundreds of vessels to aid us, and then began the first real air battle&#10;I had ever witnessed.&#10;&#10;The vessels carrying our green warriors were kept circling above the&#10;contending fleets of Helium and Zodanga, since their batteries were&#10;useless in the hands of the Tharks who, having no navy, have no skill&#10;in naval gunnery.  Their small-arm fire, however, was most effective,&#10;and the final outcome of the engagement was strongly influenced, if not&#10;wholly determined, by their presence.&#10;&#10;At first the two forces circled at the same altitude, pouring broadside&#10;after broadside into each other.  Presently a great hole was torn in&#10;the hull of one of the immense battle craft from the Zodangan camp;&#10;with a lurch she turned completely over, the little figures of her crew&#10;plunging, turning and twisting toward the ground a thousand feet below;&#10;then with sickening velocity she tore after them, almost completely&#10;burying herself in the soft loam of the ancient sea bottom.&#10;&#10;A wild cry of exultation arose from the Heliumite squadron, and with&#10;redoubled ferocity they fell upon the Zodangan fleet.  By a pretty&#10;maneuver two of the vessels of Helium gained a position above their&#10;adversaries, from which they poured upon them from their keel bomb&#10;batteries a perfect torrent of exploding bombs.&#10;&#10;Then, one by one, the battleships of Helium succeeded in rising above&#10;the Zodangans, and in a short time a number of the beleaguering&#10;battleships were drifting hopeless wrecks toward the high scarlet tower&#10;of greater Helium.  Several others attempted to escape, but they were&#10;soon surrounded by thousands of tiny individual fliers, and above each&#10;hung a monster battleship of Helium ready to drop boarding parties upon&#10;their decks.&#10;&#10;Within but little more than an hour from the moment the victorious&#10;Zodangan squadron had risen to meet us from the camp of the besiegers&#10;the battle was over, and the remaining vessels of the conquered&#10;Zodangans were headed toward the cities of Helium under prize crews.&#10;&#10;There was an extremely pathetic side to the surrender of these mighty&#10;fliers, the result of an age-old custom which demanded that surrender&#10;should be signalized by the voluntary plunging to earth of the&#10;commander of the vanquished vessel.  One after another the brave&#10;fellows, holding their colors high above their heads, leaped from the&#10;towering bows of their mighty craft to an awful death.&#10;&#10;Not until the commander of the entire fleet took the fearful plunge,&#10;thus indicating the surrender of the remaining vessels, did the&#10;fighting cease, and the useless sacrifice of brave men come to an end.&#10;&#10;We now signaled the flagship of Helium's navy to approach, and when she&#10;was within hailing distance I called out that we had the Princess Dejah&#10;Thoris on board, and that we wished to transfer her to the flagship&#10;that she might be taken immediately to the city.&#10;&#10;As the full import of my announcement bore in upon them a great cry&#10;arose from the decks of the flagship, and a moment later the colors of&#10;the Princess of Helium broke from a hundred points upon her upper&#10;works.  When the other vessels of the squadron caught the meaning of&#10;the signals flashed them they took up the wild acclaim and unfurled her&#10;colors in the gleaming sunlight.&#10;&#10;The flagship bore down upon us, and as she swung gracefully to and&#10;touched our side a dozen officers sprang upon our decks.  As their&#10;astonished gaze fell upon the hundreds of green warriors, who now came&#10;forth from the fighting shelters, they stopped aghast, but at sight of&#10;Kantos Kan, who advanced to meet them, they came forward, crowding&#10;about him.&#10;&#10;Dejah Thoris and I then advanced, and they had no eyes for other than&#10;her.  She received them gracefully, calling each by name, for they were&#10;men high in the esteem and service of her grandfather, and she knew&#10;them well.&#10;&#10;&quot;Lay your hands upon the shoulder of John Carter,&quot; she said to them,&#10;turning toward me, &quot;the man to whom Helium owes her princess as well as&#10;her victory today.&quot;&#10;&#10;They were very courteous to me and said many kind and complimentary&#10;things, but what seemed to impress them most was that I had won the aid&#10;of the fierce Tharks in my campaign for the liberation of Dejah Thoris,&#10;and the relief of Helium.&#10;&#10;&quot;You owe your thanks more to another man than to me,&quot; I said, &quot;and here&#10;he is; meet one of Barsoom's greatest soldiers and statesmen, Tars&#10;Tarkas, Jeddak of Thark.&quot;&#10;&#10;With the same polished courtesy that had marked their manner toward me&#10;they extended their greetings to the great Thark, nor, to my surprise,&#10;was he much behind them in ease of bearing or in courtly speech.&#10;Though not a garrulous race, the Tharks are extremely formal, and their&#10;ways lend themselves amazingly to dignified and courtly manners.&#10;&#10;Dejah Thoris went aboard the flagship, and was much put out that I&#10;would not follow, but, as I explained to her, the battle was but partly&#10;won; we still had the land forces of the besieging Zodangans to account&#10;for, and I would not leave Tars Tarkas until that had been accomplished.&#10;&#10;The commander of the naval forces of Helium promised to arrange to have&#10;the armies of Helium attack from the city in conjunction with our land&#10;attack, and so the vessels separated and Dejah Thoris was borne in&#10;triumph back to the court of her grandfather, Tardos Mors, Jeddak of&#10;Helium.&#10;&#10;In the distance lay our fleet of transports, with the thoats of the&#10;green warriors, where they had remained during the battle.  Without&#10;landing stages it was to be a difficult matter to unload these beasts&#10;upon the open plain, but there was nothing else for it, and so we put&#10;out for a point about ten miles from the city and began the task.&#10;&#10;It was necessary to lower the animals to the ground in slings and this&#10;work occupied the remainder of the day and half the night.  Twice we&#10;were attacked by parties of Zodangan cavalry, but with little loss,&#10;however, and after darkness shut down they withdrew.&#10;&#10;As soon as the last thoat was unloaded Tars Tarkas gave the command to&#10;advance, and in three parties we crept upon the Zodangan camp from the&#10;north, the south and the east.&#10;&#10;About a mile from the main camp we encountered their outposts and, as&#10;had been prearranged, accepted this as the signal to charge.  With&#10;wild, ferocious cries and amidst the nasty squealing of battle-enraged&#10;thoats we bore down upon the Zodangans.&#10;&#10;We did not catch them napping, but found a well-entrenched battle line&#10;confronting us.  Time after time we were repulsed until, toward noon, I&#10;began to fear for the result of the battle.&#10;&#10;The Zodangans numbered nearly a million fighting men, gathered from&#10;pole to pole, wherever stretched their ribbon-like waterways, while&#10;pitted against them were less than a hundred thousand green warriors.&#10;The forces from Helium had not arrived, nor could we receive any word&#10;from them.&#10;&#10;Just at noon we heard heavy firing all along the line between the&#10;Zodangans and the cities, and we knew then that our much-needed&#10;reinforcements had come.&#10;&#10;Again Tars Tarkas ordered the charge, and once more the mighty thoats&#10;bore their terrible riders against the ramparts of the enemy.  At the&#10;same moment the battle line of Helium surged over the opposite&#10;breastworks of the Zodangans and in another moment they were being&#10;crushed as between two millstones.  Nobly they fought, but in vain.&#10;&#10;The plain before the city became a veritable shambles ere the last&#10;Zodangan surrendered, but finally the carnage ceased, the prisoners&#10;were marched back to Helium, and we entered the greater city's gates, a&#10;huge triumphal procession of conquering heroes.&#10;&#10;The broad avenues were lined with women and children, among which were&#10;the few men whose duties necessitated that they remain within the city&#10;during the battle.  We were greeted with an endless round of applause&#10;and showered with ornaments of gold, platinum, silver, and precious&#10;jewels.  The city had gone mad with joy.&#10;&#10;My fierce Tharks caused the wildest excitement and enthusiasm.  Never&#10;before had an armed body of green warriors entered the gates of Helium,&#10;and that they came now as friends and allies filled the red men with&#10;rejoicing.&#10;&#10;That my poor services to Dejah Thoris had become known to the&#10;Heliumites was evidenced by the loud crying of my name, and by the&#10;loads of ornaments that were fastened upon me and my huge thoat as we&#10;passed up the avenues to the palace, for even in the face of the&#10;ferocious appearance of Woola the populace pressed close about me.&#10;&#10;As we approached this magnificent pile we were met by a party of&#10;officers who greeted us warmly and requested that Tars Tarkas and his&#10;jeds with the jeddaks and jeds of his wild allies, together with&#10;myself, dismount and accompany them to receive from Tardos Mors an&#10;expression of his gratitude for our services.&#10;&#10;At the top of the great steps leading up to the main portals of the&#10;palace stood the royal party, and as we reached the lower steps one of&#10;their number descended to meet us.&#10;&#10;He was an almost perfect specimen of manhood; tall, straight as an&#10;arrow, superbly muscled and with the carriage and bearing of a ruler of&#10;men.  I did not need to be told that he was Tardos Mors, Jeddak of&#10;Helium.&#10;&#10;The first member of our party he met was Tars Tarkas and his first&#10;words sealed forever the new friendship between the races.&#10;&#10;&quot;That Tardos Mors,&quot; he said, earnestly, &quot;may meet the greatest living&#10;warrior of Barsoom is a priceless honor, but that he may lay his hand&#10;on the shoulder of a friend and ally is a far greater boon.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Jeddak of Helium,&quot; returned Tars Tarkas, &quot;it has remained for a man of&#10;another world to teach the green warriors of Barsoom the meaning of&#10;friendship; to him we owe the fact that the hordes of Thark can&#10;understand you; that they can appreciate and reciprocate the sentiments&#10;so graciously expressed.&quot;&#10;&#10;Tardos Mors then greeted each of the green jeddaks and jeds, and to&#10;each spoke words of friendship and appreciation.&#10;&#10;As he approached me he laid both hands upon my shoulders.&#10;&#10;&quot;Welcome, my son,&quot; he said; &quot;that you are granted, gladly, and without&#10;one word of opposition, the most precious jewel in all Helium, yes, on&#10;all Barsoom, is sufficient earnest of my esteem.&quot;&#10;&#10;We were then presented to Mors Kajak, Jed of lesser Helium, and father&#10;of Dejah Thoris.  He had followed close behind Tardos Mors and seemed&#10;even more affected by the meeting than had his father.&#10;&#10;He tried a dozen times to express his gratitude to me, but his voice&#10;choked with emotion and he could not speak, and yet he had, as I was to&#10;later learn, a reputation for ferocity and fearlessness as a fighter&#10;that was remarkable even upon warlike Barsoom.  In common with all&#10;Helium he worshiped his daughter, nor could he think of what she had&#10;escaped without deep emotion.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER XXVII&#10;&#10;FROM JOY TO DEATH&#10;&#10;&#10;For ten days the hordes of Thark and their wild allies were feasted and&#10;entertained, and, then, loaded with costly presents and escorted by ten&#10;thousand soldiers of Helium commanded by Mors Kajak, they started on&#10;the return journey to their own lands.  The jed of lesser Helium with a&#10;small party of nobles accompanied them all the way to Thark to cement&#10;more closely the new bonds of peace and friendship.&#10;&#10;Sola also accompanied Tars Tarkas, her father, who before all his&#10;chieftains had acknowledged her as his daughter.&#10;&#10;Three weeks later, Mors Kajak and his officers, accompanied by Tars&#10;Tarkas and Sola, returned upon a battleship that had been dispatched to&#10;Thark to fetch them in time for the ceremony which made Dejah Thoris&#10;and John Carter one.&#10;&#10;For nine years I served in the councils and fought in the armies of&#10;Helium as a prince of the house of Tardos Mors.  The people seemed&#10;never to tire of heaping honors upon me, and no day passed that did not&#10;bring some new proof of their love for my princess, the incomparable&#10;Dejah Thoris.&#10;&#10;In a golden incubator upon the roof of our palace lay a snow-white egg.&#10;For nearly five years ten soldiers of the jeddak's Guard had constantly&#10;stood over it, and not a day passed when I was in the city that Dejah&#10;Thoris and I did not stand hand in hand before our little shrine&#10;planning for the future, when the delicate shell should break.&#10;&#10;Vivid in my memory is the picture of the last night as we sat there&#10;talking in low tones of the strange romance which had woven our lives&#10;together and of this wonder which was coming to augment our happiness&#10;and fulfill our hopes.&#10;&#10;In the distance we saw the bright-white light of an approaching&#10;airship, but we attached no special significance to so common a sight.&#10;Like a bolt of lightning it raced toward Helium until its very speed&#10;bespoke the unusual.&#10;&#10;Flashing the signals which proclaimed it a dispatch bearer for the&#10;jeddak, it circled impatiently awaiting the tardy patrol boat which&#10;must convoy it to the palace docks.&#10;&#10;Ten minutes after it touched at the palace a message called me to the&#10;council chamber, which I found filling with the members of that body.&#10;&#10;On the raised platform of the throne was Tardos Mors, pacing back and&#10;forth with tense-drawn face.  When all were in their seats he turned&#10;toward us.&#10;&#10;&quot;This morning,&quot; he said, &quot;word reached the several governments of&#10;Barsoom that the keeper of the atmosphere plant had made no wireless&#10;report for two days, nor had almost ceaseless calls upon him from a&#10;score of capitals elicited a sign of response.&#10;&#10;&quot;The ambassadors of the other nations asked us to take the matter in&#10;hand and hasten the assistant keeper to the plant.  All day a thousand&#10;cruisers have been searching for him until just now one of them returns&#10;bearing his dead body, which was found in the pits beneath his house&#10;horribly mutilated by some assassin.&#10;&#10;&quot;I do not need to tell you what this means to Barsoom.  It would take&#10;months to penetrate those mighty walls, in fact the work has already&#10;commenced, and there would be little to fear were the engine of the&#10;pumping plant to run as it should and as they all have for hundreds of&#10;years; but the worst, we fear, has happened.  The instruments show&#10;a rapidly decreasing air pressure on all parts of Barsoom--the engine&#10;has stopped.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;My gentlemen,&quot; he concluded, &quot;we have at best three days to live.&quot;&#10;&#10;There was absolute silence for several minutes, and then a young noble&#10;arose, and with his drawn sword held high above his head addressed&#10;Tardos Mors.&#10;&#10;&quot;The men of Helium have prided themselves that they have ever shown&#10;Barsoom how a nation of red men should live, now is our opportunity to&#10;show them how they should die.  Let us go about our duties as though a&#10;thousand useful years still lay before us.&quot;&#10;&#10;The chamber rang with applause and as there was nothing better to do&#10;than to allay the fears of the people by our example we went our ways&#10;with smiles upon our faces and sorrow gnawing at our hearts.&#10;&#10;When I returned to my palace I found that the rumor already had reached&#10;Dejah Thoris, so I told her all that I had heard.&#10;&#10;&quot;We have been very happy, John Carter,&quot; she said, &quot;and I thank whatever&#10;fate overtakes us that it permits us to die together.&quot;&#10;&#10;The next two days brought no noticeable change in the supply of air,&#10;but on the morning of the third day breathing became difficult at the&#10;higher altitudes of the rooftops.  The avenues and plazas of Helium&#10;were filled with people.  All business had ceased.  For the most part&#10;the people looked bravely into the face of their unalterable doom.&#10;Here and there, however, men and women gave way to quiet grief.&#10;&#10;Toward the middle of the day many of the weaker commenced to succumb&#10;and within an hour the people of Barsoom were sinking by thousands into&#10;the unconsciousness which precedes death by asphyxiation.&#10;&#10;Dejah Thoris and I with the other members of the royal family had&#10;collected in a sunken garden within an inner courtyard of the palace.&#10;We conversed in low tones, when we conversed at all, as the awe of the&#10;grim shadow of death crept over us.  Even Woola seemed to feel the&#10;weight of the impending calamity, for he pressed close to Dejah Thoris&#10;and to me, whining pitifully.&#10;&#10;The little incubator had been brought from the roof of our palace at&#10;request of Dejah Thoris and she sat gazing longingly upon the&#10;unknown little life that now she would never know.&#10;&#10;As it was becoming perceptibly difficult to breathe Tardos Mors arose,&#10;saying,&#10;&#10;&quot;Let us bid each other farewell.  The days of the greatness of Barsoom&#10;are over.  Tomorrow's sun will look down upon a dead world which&#10;through all eternity must go swinging through the heavens peopled not&#10;even by memories.  It is the end.&quot;&#10;&#10;He stooped and kissed the women of his family, and laid his strong hand&#10;upon the shoulders of the men.&#10;&#10;As I turned sadly from him my eyes fell upon Dejah Thoris.  Her head&#10;was drooping upon her breast, to all appearances she was lifeless.&#10;With a cry I sprang to her and raised her in my arms.&#10;&#10;Her eyes opened and looked into mine.&#10;&#10;&quot;Kiss me, John Carter,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;I love you!  I love you!  It is&#10;cruel that we must be torn apart who were just starting upon a life of&#10;love and happiness.&quot;&#10;&#10;As I pressed her dear lips to mine the old feeling of unconquerable&#10;power and authority rose in me.  The fighting blood of Virginia sprang&#10;to life in my veins.&#10;&#10;&quot;It shall not be, my princess,&quot; I cried.  &quot;There is, there must be some&#10;way, and John Carter, who has fought his way through a strange world&#10;for love of you, will find it.&quot;&#10;&#10;And with my words there crept above the threshold of my conscious mind&#10;a series of nine long forgotten sounds.  Like a flash of lightning in&#10;the darkness their full purport dawned upon me--the key to the three&#10;great doors of the atmosphere plant!&#10;&#10;Turning suddenly toward Tardos Mors as I still clasped my dying love to&#10;my breast I cried.&#10;&#10;&quot;A flier, Jeddak!  Quick!  Order your swiftest flier to the palace top.&#10;I can save Barsoom yet.&quot;&#10;&#10;He did not wait to question, but in an instant a guard was racing to&#10;the nearest dock and though the air was thin and almost gone at the&#10;rooftop they managed to launch the fastest one-man, air-scout machine&#10;that the skill of Barsoom had ever produced.&#10;&#10;Kissing Dejah Thoris a dozen times and commanding Woola, who would have&#10;followed me, to remain and guard her, I bounded with my old agility and&#10;strength to the high ramparts of the palace, and in another moment I&#10;was headed toward the goal of the hopes of all Barsoom.&#10;&#10;I had to fly low to get sufficient air to breathe, but I took a&#10;straight course across an old sea bottom and so had to rise only a few&#10;feet above the ground.&#10;&#10;I traveled with awful velocity for my errand was a race against time&#10;with death.  The face of Dejah Thoris hung always before me.  As I&#10;turned for a last look as I left the palace garden I had seen her&#10;stagger and sink upon the ground beside the little incubator.  That she&#10;had dropped into the last coma which would end in death, if the air&#10;supply remained unreplenished, I well knew, and so, throwing caution to&#10;the winds, I flung overboard everything but the engine and compass,&#10;even to my ornaments, and lying on my belly along the deck with one&#10;hand on the steering wheel and the other pushing the speed lever to its&#10;last notch I split the thin air of dying Mars with the speed of a&#10;meteor.&#10;&#10;An hour before dark the great walls of the atmosphere plant loomed&#10;suddenly before me, and with a sickening thud I plunged to the ground&#10;before the small door which was withholding the spark of life from the&#10;inhabitants of an entire planet.&#10;&#10;Beside the door a great crew of men had been laboring to pierce the&#10;wall, but they had scarcely scratched the flint-like surface, and now&#10;most of them lay in the last sleep from which not even air would awaken&#10;them.&#10;&#10;Conditions seemed much worse here than at Helium, and it was with&#10;difficulty that I breathed at all.  There were a few men still&#10;conscious, and to one of these I spoke.&#10;&#10;&quot;If I can open these doors is there a man who can start the engines?&quot; I&#10;asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;I can,&quot; he replied, &quot;if you open quickly.  I can last but a few&#10;moments more.  But it is useless, they are both dead and no one else&#10;upon Barsoom knew the secret of these awful locks.  For three days men&#10;crazed with fear have surged about this portal in vain attempts to&#10;solve its mystery.&quot;&#10;&#10;I had no time to talk, I was becoming very weak and it was with&#10;difficulty that I controlled my mind at all.&#10;&#10;But, with a final effort, as I sank weakly to my knees I hurled the&#10;nine thought waves at that awful thing before me.  The Martian had&#10;crawled to my side and with staring eyes fixed on the single panel&#10;before us we waited in the silence of death.&#10;&#10;Slowly the mighty door receded before us.  I attempted to rise and&#10;follow it but I was too weak.&#10;&#10;&quot;After it,&quot; I cried to my companion, &quot;and if you reach the pump room&#10;turn loose all the pumps.  It is the only chance Barsoom has to exist&#10;tomorrow!&quot;&#10;&#10;From where I lay I opened the second door, and then the third, and as I&#10;saw the hope of Barsoom crawling weakly on hands and knees through the&#10;last doorway I sank unconscious upon the ground.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CHAPTER XXVIII&#10;&#10;AT THE ARIZONA CAVE&#10;&#10;&#10;It was dark when I opened my eyes again.  Strange, stiff garments were&#10;upon my body; garments that cracked and powdered away from me as I rose&#10;to a sitting posture.&#10;&#10;I felt myself over from head to foot and from head to foot I was&#10;clothed, though when I fell unconscious at the little doorway I had&#10;been naked.  Before me was a small patch of moonlit sky which showed&#10;through a ragged aperture.&#10;&#10;As my hands passed over my body they came in contact with pockets and&#10;in one of these a small parcel of matches wrapped in oiled paper.  One&#10;of these matches I struck, and its dim flame lighted up what appeared&#10;to be a huge cave, toward the back of which I discovered a strange,&#10;still figure huddled over a tiny bench.  As I approached it I saw that&#10;it was the dead and mummified remains of a little old woman with long&#10;black hair, and the thing it leaned over was a small charcoal burner&#10;upon which rested a round copper vessel containing a small quantity of&#10;greenish powder.&#10;&#10;Behind her, depending from the roof upon rawhide thongs, and stretching&#10;entirely across the cave, was a row of human skeletons.  From the thong&#10;which held them stretched another to the dead hand of the little old&#10;woman; as I touched the cord the skeletons swung to the motion with a&#10;noise as of the rustling of dry leaves.&#10;&#10;It was a most grotesque and horrid tableau and I hastened out into the&#10;fresh air; glad to escape from so gruesome a place.&#10;&#10;The sight that met my eyes as I stepped out upon a small ledge which&#10;ran before the entrance of the cave filled me with consternation.&#10;&#10;A new heaven and a new landscape met my gaze.  The silvered mountains&#10;in the distance, the almost stationary moon hanging in the sky, the&#10;cacti-studded valley below me were not of Mars.  I could scarce&#10;believe my eyes, but the truth slowly forced itself upon me--I was&#10;looking upon Arizona from the same ledge from which ten years before I&#10;had gazed with longing upon Mars.&#10;&#10;Burying my head in my arms I turned, broken, and sorrowful, down the&#10;trail from the cave.&#10;&#10;Above me shone the red eye of Mars holding her awful secret,&#10;forty-eight million miles away.&#10;&#10;Did the Martian reach the pump room?  Did the vitalizing air reach the&#10;people of that distant planet in time to save them?  Was my Dejah&#10;Thoris alive, or did her beautiful body lie cold in death beside the&#10;tiny golden incubator in the sunken garden of the inner courtyard of&#10;the palace of Tardos Mors, the jeddak of Helium?&#10;&#10;For ten years I have waited and prayed for an answer to my questions.&#10;For ten years I have waited and prayed to be taken back to the world of&#10;my lost love.  I would rather lie dead beside her there than live on&#10;Earth all those millions of terrible miles from her.&#10;&#10;The old mine, which I found untouched, has made me fabulously wealthy;&#10;but what care I for wealth!&#10;&#10;As I sit here tonight in my little study overlooking the Hudson, just&#10;twenty years have elapsed since I first opened my eyes upon Mars.&#10;&#10;I can see her shining in the sky through the little window by my desk,&#10;and tonight she seems calling to me again as she has not called before&#10;since that long dead night, and I think I can see, across that awful&#10;abyss of space, a beautiful black-haired woman standing in the garden&#10;of a palace, and at her side is a little boy who puts his arm around&#10;her as she points into the sky toward the planet Earth, while at their&#10;feet is a huge and hideous creature with a heart of gold.&#10;&#10;I believe that they are waiting there for me, and something tells me&#10;that I shall soon know.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;End of Project Gutenberg's A Princess of Mars, by Edgar Rice Burroughs&#10;&#10;*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A PRINCESS OF MARS ***&#10;&#10;***** This file should be named 62.txt or 62.zip *****&#10;This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:&#10;        http://www.gutenberg.org/6/62/&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions&#10;will be renamed.&#10;&#10;Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no&#10;one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation&#10;(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without&#10;permission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm&#10;&#10;Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of&#10;electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers&#10;including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists&#10;because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from&#10;people in all walks of life.&#10;&#10;Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the&#10;assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's&#10;goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will&#10;remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project&#10;Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure&#10;and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.&#10;To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation&#10;and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4&#10;and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.&#10;&#10;&#10;Section 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg&#10;Literary Archive Foundation&#10;&#10;Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide&#10;spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of&#10;increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be&#10;freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest&#10;array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations&#10;($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt&#10;status with the IRS.&#10;&#10;The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating&#10;charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United&#10;States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a&#10;considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up&#10;with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations&#10;where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To&#10;SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any&#10;particular state visit http://pglaf.org&#10;&#10;While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we&#10;have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition&#10;against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who&#10;approach us with offers to donate.&#10;&#10;International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make&#10;any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from&#10;outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.&#10;&#10;Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation&#10;methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other&#10;ways including including checks, online payments and credit card&#10;donations.

Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm&#10;concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared&#10;with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project&#10;Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.&#10;&#10;&#10;Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed&#10;editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.&#10;unless a copyright notice is included.

Auguste Dupin, in his little back library, or&#10;book-closet, au troisiÃªme, No. 33, Rue DunÃ´t, Faubourg St. Germain. For&#10;one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence; while each, to&#10;any casual observer, might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied&#10;with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the&#10;chamber. For myself, however, I was mentally discussing certain topics&#10;which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period&#10;of the evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue, and the mystery&#10;attending the murder of Marie RogÃªt. I looked upon it, therefore, as&#10;something of a coincidence, when the door of our apartment was thrown&#10;open and admitted our old acquaintance, Monsieur G--, the Prefect of the&#10;Parisian police.&#10;&#10;We gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much of the&#10;entertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we had not seen&#10;him for several years. We had been sitting in the dark, and Dupin now&#10;arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp, but sat down again, without&#10;doing so, upon G.'s saying that he had called to consult us, or rather&#10;to ask the opinion of my friend, about some official business which had&#10;occasioned a great deal of trouble.&#10;&#10;&quot;If it is any point requiring reflection,&quot; observed Dupin, as he&#10;forebore to enkindle the wick, &quot;we shall examine it to better purpose in&#10;the dark.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That is another of your odd notions,&quot; said the Prefect, who had a&#10;fashion of calling every thing &quot;odd&quot; that was beyond his comprehension,&#10;and thus lived amid an absolute legion of &quot;oddities.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Very true,&quot; said Dupin, as he supplied his visiter with a pipe, and&#10;rolled towards him a comfortable chair.&#10;&#10;&quot;And what is the difficulty now?&quot; I asked. &quot;Nothing more in the&#10;assassination way, I hope?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh no; nothing of that nature. The fact is, the business is very simple&#10;indeed, and I make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well&#10;ourselves; but then I thought Dupin would like to hear the details of&#10;it, because it is so excessively odd.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Simple and odd,&quot; said Dupin.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, yes; and not exactly that, either. The fact is, we have all been&#10;a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple, and yet baffles us&#10;altogether.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at&#10;fault,&quot; said my friend.&#10;&#10;&quot;What nonsense you do talk!&quot; replied the Prefect, laughing heartily.&#10;&#10;&quot;Perhaps the mystery is a little too plain,&quot; said Dupin.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, good heavens! who ever heard of such an idea?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A little too self-evident.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ha! ha! ha--ha! ha! ha!--ho! ho! ho!&quot; roared our visiter, profoundly&#10;amused, &quot;oh, Dupin, you will be the death of me yet!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And what, after all, is the matter on hand?&quot; I asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, I will tell you,&quot; replied the Prefect, as he gave a long, steady&#10;and contemplative puff, and settled himself in his chair. &quot;I will tell&#10;you in a few words; but, before I begin, let me caution you that this&#10;is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy, and that I should most&#10;probably lose the position I now hold, were it known that I confided it&#10;to any one.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Proceed,&quot; said I.&#10;&#10;&quot;Or not,&quot; said Dupin.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, then; I have received personal information, from a very high&#10;quarter, that a certain document of the last importance, has been&#10;purloined from the royal apartments. The individual who purloined it is&#10;known; this beyond a doubt; he was seen to take it. It is known, also,&#10;that it still remains in his possession.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How is this known?&quot; asked Dupin.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is clearly inferred,&quot; replied the Prefect, &quot;from the nature of the&#10;document, and from the non-appearance of certain results which would at&#10;once arise from its passing out of the robber's possession; that is to&#10;say, from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Be a little more explicit,&quot; I said.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder&#10;a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely&#10;valuable.&quot; The Prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy.&#10;&#10;&quot;Still I do not quite understand,&quot; said Dupin.&#10;&#10;&quot;No? Well; the disclosure of the document to a third person, who shall&#10;be nameless, would bring in question the honor of a personage of most&#10;exalted station; and this fact gives the holder of the document an&#10;ascendancy over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so&#10;jeopardized.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But this ascendancy,&quot; I interposed, &quot;would depend upon the robber's&#10;knowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber. Who would dare--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The thief,&quot; said G., &quot;is the Minister D--, who dares all things, those&#10;unbecoming as well as those becoming a man. The method of the theft was&#10;not less ingenious than bold. The document in question--a letter, to&#10;be frank--had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the&#10;royal boudoir. During its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the&#10;entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her&#10;wish to conceal it. After a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in&#10;a drawer, she was forced to place it, open as it was, upon a table. The&#10;address, however, was uppermost, and, the contents thus unexposed, the&#10;letter escaped notice. At this juncture enters the Minister D--. His&#10;lynx eye immediately perceives the paper, recognises the handwriting&#10;of the address, observes the confusion of the personage addressed, and&#10;fathoms her secret. After some business transactions, hurried through in&#10;his ordinary manner, he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one&#10;in question, opens it, pretends to read it, and then places it in&#10;close juxtaposition to the other. Again he converses, for some fifteen&#10;minutes, upon the public affairs. At length, in taking leave, he takes&#10;also from the table the letter to which he had no claim. Its rightful&#10;owner saw, but, of course, dared not call attention to the act, in the&#10;presence of the third personage who stood at her elbow. The minister&#10;decamped; leaving his own letter--one of no importance--upon the table.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Here, then,&quot; said Dupin to me, &quot;you have precisely what you demand&#10;to make the ascendancy complete--the robber's knowledge of the loser's&#10;knowledge of the robber.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; replied the Prefect; &quot;and the power thus attained has, for some&#10;months past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very dangerous&#10;extent. The personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced, every day, of&#10;the necessity of reclaiming her letter. But this, of course, cannot be&#10;done openly. In fine, driven to despair, she has committed the matter to&#10;me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Than whom,&quot; said Dupin, amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke, &quot;no more&#10;sagacious agent could, I suppose, be desired, or even imagined.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You flatter me,&quot; replied the Prefect; &quot;but it is possible that some&#10;such opinion may have been entertained.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is clear,&quot; said I, &quot;as you observe, that the letter is still in&#10;possession of the minister; since it is this possession, and not any&#10;employment of the letter, which bestows the power. With the employment&#10;the power departs.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;True,&quot; said G.; &quot;and upon this conviction I proceeded. My first care&#10;was to make thorough search of the minister's hotel; and here my chief&#10;embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge.&#10;Beyond all things, I have been warned of the danger which would result&#10;from giving him reason to suspect our design.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But,&quot; said I, &quot;you are quite au fait in these investigations. The&#10;Parisian police have done this thing often before.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;O yes; and for this reason I did not despair. The habits of the&#10;minister gave me, too, a great advantage. He is frequently absent from&#10;home all night. His servants are by no means numerous. They sleep at a&#10;distance from their master's apartment, and, being chiefly Neapolitans,&#10;are readily made drunk. I have keys, as you know, with which I can&#10;open any chamber or cabinet in Paris. For three months a night has&#10;not passed, during the greater part of which I have not been engaged,&#10;personally, in ransacking the D-- Hotel. My honor is interested, and, to&#10;mention a great secret, the reward is enormous. So I did not abandon&#10;the search until I had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more&#10;astute man than myself. I fancy that I have investigated every nook and&#10;corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be&#10;concealed.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But is it not possible,&quot; I suggested, &quot;that although the letter may&#10;be in possession of the minister, as it unquestionably is, he may have&#10;concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;This is barely possible,&quot; said Dupin. &quot;The present peculiar condition&#10;of affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues in which D--&#10;is known to be involved, would render the instant availability of the&#10;document--its susceptibility of being produced at a moment's notice--a&#10;point of nearly equal importance with its possession.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Its susceptibility of being produced?&quot; said I.&#10;&#10;&quot;That is to say, of being destroyed,&quot; said Dupin.&#10;&#10;&quot;True,&quot; I observed; &quot;the paper is clearly then upon the premises. As for&#10;its being upon the person of the minister, we may consider that as out&#10;of the question.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Entirely,&quot; said the Prefect. &quot;He has been twice waylaid, as if by&#10;footpads, and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You might have spared yourself this trouble,&quot; said Dupin. &quot;D--, I&#10;presume, is not altogether a fool, and, if not, must have anticipated&#10;these waylayings, as a matter of course.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Not altogether a fool,&quot; said G., &quot;but then he's a poet, which I take to&#10;be only one remove from a fool.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;True,&quot; said Dupin, after a long and thoughtful whiff from&#10;his meerschaum, &quot;although I have been guilty of certain doggrel myself.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Suppose you detail,&quot; said I, &quot;the particulars of your search.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why the fact is, we took our time, and we searched every where. I have&#10;had long experience in these affairs. I took the entire building, room&#10;by room; devoting the nights of a whole week to each. We examined,&#10;first, the furniture of each apartment. We opened every possible drawer;&#10;and I presume you know that, to a properly trained police agent, such a&#10;thing as a secret drawer is impossible. Any man is a dolt who permits a&#10;'secret' drawer to escape him in a search of this kind. The thing is so&#10;plain. There is a certain amount of bulk--of space--to be accounted for&#10;in every cabinet. Then we have accurate rules. The fiftieth part of a&#10;line could not escape us. After the cabinets we took the chairs. The&#10;cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ.&#10;From the tables we removed the tops.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why so?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Sometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece of&#10;furniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article; then&#10;the leg is excavated, the article deposited within the cavity, and the&#10;top replaced. The bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same&#10;way.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But could not the cavity be detected by sounding?&quot; I asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;By no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient wadding&#10;of cotton be placed around it. Besides, in our case, we were obliged to&#10;proceed without noise.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But you could not have removed--you could not have taken to pieces all&#10;articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a&#10;deposit in the manner you mention. A letter may be compressed into&#10;a thin spiral roll, not differing much in shape or bulk from a large&#10;knitting-needle, and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of&#10;a chair, for example. You did not take to pieces all the chairs?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Certainly not; but we did better--we examined the rungs of every&#10;chair in the hotel, and, indeed the jointings of every description of&#10;furniture, by the aid of a most powerful microscope. Had there been&#10;any traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it&#10;instantly. A single grain of gimlet-dust, for example, would have been&#10;as obvious as an apple. Any disorder in the glueing--any unusual gaping&#10;in the joints--would have sufficed to insure detection.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the plates,&#10;and you probed the beds and the bed-clothes, as well as the curtains and&#10;carpets.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That of course; and when we had absolutely completed every particle of&#10;the furniture in this way, then we examined the house itself. We divided&#10;its entire surface into compartments, which we numbered, so that&#10;none might be missed; then we scrutinized each individual square inch&#10;throughout the premises, including the two houses immediately adjoining,&#10;with the microscope, as before.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The two houses adjoining!&quot; I exclaimed; &quot;you must have had a great deal&#10;of trouble.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We had; but the reward offered is prodigious!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You include the grounds about the houses?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;All the grounds are paved with brick. They gave us comparatively&#10;little trouble. We examined the moss between the bricks, and found it&#10;undisturbed.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You looked among D--'s papers, of course, and into the books of the&#10;library?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only opened&#10;every book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume, not contenting&#10;ourselves with a mere shake, according to the fashion of some of our&#10;police officers. We also measured the thickness of every book-cover,&#10;with the most accurate admeasurement, and applied to each the most&#10;jealous scrutiny of the microscope. Had any of the bindings been&#10;recently meddled with, it would have been utterly impossible that the&#10;fact should have escaped observation. Some five or six volumes, just&#10;from the hands of the binder, we carefully probed, longitudinally, with&#10;the needles.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You explored the floors beneath the carpets?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Beyond doubt. We removed every carpet, and examined the boards with the&#10;microscope.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And the paper on the walls?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You looked into the cellars?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We did.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then,&quot; I said, &quot;you have been making a miscalculation, and the letter&#10;is not upon the premises, as you suppose.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I fear you are right there,&quot; said the Prefect. &quot;And now, Dupin, what&#10;would you advise me to do?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;To make a thorough re-search of the premises.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That is absolutely needless,&quot; replied G--. &quot;I am not more sure that I&#10;breathe than I am that the letter is not at the Hotel.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have no better advice to give you,&quot; said Dupin. &quot;You have, of course,&#10;an accurate description of the letter?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh yes!&quot;--And here the Prefect, producing a memorandum-book proceeded&#10;to read aloud a minute account of the internal, and especially of the&#10;external appearance of the missing document. Soon after finishing&#10;the perusal of this description, he took his departure, more entirely&#10;depressed in spirits than I had ever known the good gentleman before. In&#10;about a month afterwards he paid us another visit, and found us occupied&#10;very nearly as before. He took a pipe and a chair and entered into some&#10;ordinary conversation. At length I said,--&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, but G--, what of the purloined letter? I presume you have at&#10;last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the&#10;Minister?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Confound him, say I--yes; I made the re-examination, however, as Dupin&#10;suggested--but it was all labor lost, as I knew it would be.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How much was the reward offered, did you say?&quot; asked Dupin.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, a very great deal--a very liberal reward--I don't like to say how&#10;much, precisely; but one thing I will say, that I wouldn't mind giving&#10;my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who could&#10;obtain me that letter. The fact is, it is becoming of more and more&#10;importance every day; and the reward has been lately doubled. If it were&#10;trebled, however, I could do no more than I have done.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, yes,&quot; said Dupin, drawlingly, between the whiffs of his&#10;meerschaum, &quot;I really--think, G--, you have not exerted yourself--to the&#10;utmost in this matter. You might--do a little more, I think, eh?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How?--in what way?'&#10;&#10;&quot;Why--puff, puff--you might--puff, puff--employ counsel in the&#10;matter, eh?--puff, puff, puff. Do you remember the story they tell of&#10;Abernethy?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No; hang Abernethy!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;To be sure! hang him and welcome. But, once upon a time, a certain rich&#10;miser conceived the design of spunging upon this Abernethy for a medical&#10;opinion. Getting up, for this purpose, an ordinary conversation in a&#10;private company, he insinuated his case to the physician, as that of an&#10;imaginary individual.&#10;&#10;&quot;'We will suppose,' said the miser, 'that his symptoms are such and&#10;such; now, doctor, what would you have directed him to take?'&#10;&#10;&quot;'Take!' said Abernethy, 'why, take advice, to be sure.'&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But,&quot; said the Prefect, a little discomposed, &quot;I am perfectly willing&#10;to take advice, and to pay for it. I would really give fifty thousand&#10;francs to any one who would aid me in the matter.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In that case,&quot; replied Dupin, opening a drawer, and producing&#10;a check-book, &quot;you may as well fill me up a check for the amount&#10;mentioned. When you have signed it, I will hand you the letter.&quot;&#10;&#10;I was astounded. The Prefect appeared absolutely thunder-stricken.&#10;For some minutes he remained speechless and motionless, looking&#10;incredulously at my friend with open mouth, and eyes that seemed&#10;starting from their sockets; then, apparently recovering himself in some&#10;measure, he seized a pen, and after several pauses and vacant stares,&#10;finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs, and&#10;handed it across the table to Dupin. The latter examined it carefully&#10;and deposited it in his pocket-book; then, unlocking an escritoire, took&#10;thence a letter and gave it to the Prefect. This functionary grasped it&#10;in a perfect agony of joy, opened it with a trembling hand, cast a rapid&#10;glance at its contents, and then, scrambling and struggling to the&#10;door, rushed at length unceremoniously from the room and from the house,&#10;without having uttered a syllable since Dupin had requested him to fill&#10;up the check.&#10;&#10;When he had gone, my friend entered into some explanations.&#10;&#10;&quot;The Parisian police,&quot; he said, &quot;are exceedingly able in their way.&#10;They are persevering, ingenious, cunning, and thoroughly versed in the&#10;knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand. Thus, when G--&#10;detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the Hotel D--,&#10;I felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory&#10;investigation--so far as his labors extended.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;So far as his labors extended?&quot; said I.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; said Dupin. &quot;The measures adopted were not only the best of&#10;their kind, but carried out to absolute perfection. Had the letter been&#10;deposited within the range of their search, these fellows would, beyond&#10;a question, have found it.&quot;&#10;&#10;I merely laughed--but he seemed quite serious in all that he said.&#10;&#10;&quot;The measures, then,&quot; he continued, &quot;were good in their kind, and well&#10;executed; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case, and&#10;to the man. A certain set of highly ingenious resources are, with the&#10;Prefect, a sort of Procrustean bed, to which he forcibly adapts his&#10;designs. But he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow, for&#10;the matter in hand; and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than he. I&#10;knew one about eight years of age, whose success at guessing in the game&#10;of 'even and odd' attracted universal admiration. This game is simple,&#10;and is played with marbles. One player holds in his hand a number of&#10;these toys, and demands of another whether that number is even or odd.&#10;If the guess is right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he loses one. The&#10;boy to whom I allude won all the marbles of the school. Of course he&#10;had some principle of guessing; and this lay in mere observation and&#10;admeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents. For example, an arrant&#10;simpleton is his opponent, and, holding up his closed hand, asks, 'are&#10;they even or odd?' Our schoolboy replies, 'odd,' and loses; but upon the&#10;second trial he wins, for he then says to himself, 'the simpleton&#10;had them even upon the first trial, and his amount of cunning is just&#10;sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second; I will therefore&#10;guess odd;'--he guesses odd, and wins. Now, with a simpleton a degree&#10;above the first, he would have reasoned thus: 'This fellow finds that in&#10;the first instance I guessed odd, and, in the second, he will propose to&#10;himself, upon the first impulse, a simple variation from even to odd,&#10;as did the first simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that&#10;this is too simple a variation, and finally he will decide upon putting&#10;it even as before. I will therefore guess even;'--he guesses even, and&#10;wins. Now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy, whom his fellows&#10;termed 'lucky,'--what, in its last analysis, is it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is merely,&quot; I said, &quot;an identification of the reasoner's intellect&#10;with that of his opponent.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is,&quot; said Dupin; &quot;and, upon inquiring of the boy by what means he&#10;effected the thorough identification in which his success consisted, I&#10;received answer as follows: 'When I wish to find out how wise, or how&#10;stupid, or how good, or how wicked is any one, or what are his thoughts&#10;at the moment, I fashion the expression of my face, as accurately as&#10;possible, in accordance with the expression of his, and then wait to see&#10;what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to match or&#10;correspond with the expression.' This response of the schoolboy lies at&#10;the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to&#10;Rochefoucault, to La Bougive, to Machiavelli, and to Campanella.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And the identification,&quot; I said, &quot;of the reasoner's intellect with that&#10;of his opponent, depends, if I understand you aright, upon the accuracy&#10;with which the opponent's intellect is admeasured.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;For its practical value it depends upon this,&quot; replied Dupin; &quot;and the&#10;Prefect and his cohort fail so frequently, first, by default of this&#10;identification, and, secondly, by ill-admeasurement, or rather through&#10;non-admeasurement, of the intellect with which they are engaged. They&#10;consider only their own ideas of ingenuity; and, in searching for&#10;anything hidden, advert only to the modes in which they would have&#10;hidden it. They are right in this much--that their own ingenuity is a&#10;faithful representative of that of the mass; but when the cunning of the&#10;individual felon is diverse in character from their own, the felon foils&#10;them, of course. This always happens when it is above their own, and&#10;very usually when it is below. They have no variation of principle in&#10;their investigations; at best, when urged by some unusual emergency--by&#10;some extraordinary reward--they extend or exaggerate their old modes of&#10;practice, without touching their principles. What, for example, in this&#10;case of D--, has been done to vary the principle of action? What is&#10;all this boring, and probing, and sounding, and scrutinizing with the&#10;microscope and dividing the surface of the building into registered&#10;square inches--what is it all but an exaggeration of the application of&#10;the one principle or set of principles of search, which are based upon&#10;the one set of notions regarding human ingenuity, to which the Prefect,&#10;in the long routine of his duty, has been accustomed? Do you not see he&#10;has taken it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter,--not&#10;exactly in a gimlet hole bored in a chair-leg--but, at least, in some&#10;out-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought&#10;which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole bored in&#10;a chair-leg? And do you not see also, that such recherchÃ©s nooks for&#10;concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions, and would be&#10;adopted only by ordinary intellects; for, in all cases of concealment,&#10;a disposal of the article concealed--a disposal of it in this recherchÃ©&#10;manner,--is, in the very first instance, presumable and presumed; and&#10;thus its discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but altogether&#10;upon the mere care, patience, and determination of the seekers; and&#10;where the case is of importance--or, what amounts to the same thing in&#10;the policial eyes, when the reward is of magnitude,--the qualities in&#10;question have never been known to fail. You will now understand what I&#10;meant in suggesting that, had the purloined letter been hidden any where&#10;within the limits of the Prefect's examination--in other words, had the&#10;principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of&#10;the Prefect--its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond&#10;question. This functionary, however, has been thoroughly mystified;&#10;and the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the&#10;Minister is a fool, because he has acquired renown as a poet. All fools&#10;are poets; this the Prefect feels; and he is merely guilty of a non&#10;distributio medii in thence inferring that all poets are fools.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But is this really the poet?&quot; I asked. &quot;There are two brothers, I know;&#10;and both have attained reputation in letters. The Minister I believe has&#10;written learnedly on the Differential Calculus. He is a mathematician,&#10;and no poet.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You are mistaken; I know him well; he is both. As poet and&#10;mathematician, he would reason well; as mere mathematician, he could&#10;not have reasoned at all, and thus would have been at the mercy of the&#10;Prefect.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You surprise me,&quot; I said, &quot;by these opinions, which have been&#10;contradicted by the voice of the world. You do not mean to set at naught&#10;the well-digested idea of centuries. The mathematical reason has long&#10;been regarded as the reason par excellence.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;'Il y a Ã  pariÃ¨r,'&quot; replied Dupin, quoting from Chamfort, &quot;'que toute&#10;idÃ©e publique, toute convention reÃ§ue est une sottise, car elle a&#10;convenue au plus grand nombre.' The mathematicians, I grant you, have&#10;done their best to promulgate the popular error to which you allude, and&#10;which is none the less an error for its promulgation as truth. With an&#10;art worthy a better cause, for example, they have insinuated the term&#10;'analysis' into application to algebra. The French are the originators&#10;of this particular deception; but if a term is of any importance--if&#10;words derive any value from applicability--then 'analysis' conveys&#10;'algebra' about as much as, in Latin, 'ambitus' implies 'ambition,'&#10;'religio' 'religion,' or 'homines honesti,' a set of honorablemen.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You have a quarrel on hand, I see,&quot; said I, &quot;with some of the&#10;algebraists of Paris; but proceed.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I dispute the availability, and thus the value, of that reason which&#10;is cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly logical.&#10;I dispute, in particular, the reason educed by mathematical study. The&#10;mathematics are the science of form and quantity; mathematical reasoning&#10;is merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity. The great&#10;error lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called pure&#10;algebra, are abstract or general truths. And this error is so egregious&#10;that I am confounded at the universality with which it has been&#10;received. Mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth. What is&#10;true of relation--of form and quantity--is often grossly false in regard&#10;to morals, for example. In this latter science it is very usually untrue&#10;that the aggregated parts are equal to the whole. In chemistry also the&#10;axiom fails. In the consideration of motive it fails; for two motives,&#10;each of a given value, have not, necessarily, a value when united, equal&#10;to the sum of their values apart. There are numerous other mathematical&#10;truths which are only truths within the limits of relation. But the&#10;mathematician argues, from his finite truths, through habit, as if&#10;they were of an absolutely general applicability--as the world indeed&#10;imagines them to be. Bryant, in his very learned 'Mythology,' mentions&#10;an analogous source of error, when he says that 'although the Pagan&#10;fables are not believed, yet we forget ourselves continually, and make&#10;inferences from them as existing realities.' With the algebraists,&#10;however, who are Pagans themselves, the 'Pagan fables' are believed, and&#10;the inferences are made, not so much through lapse of memory, as&#10;through an unaccountable addling of the brains. In short, I never yet&#10;encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal&#10;roots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith&#10;that x2+px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q. Say to one of&#10;these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please, that you believe&#10;occasions may occur where x2+px is not altogether equal to q, and,&#10;having made him understand what you mean, get out of his reach as&#10;speedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock you&#10;down.&#10;&#10;&quot;I mean to say,&quot; continued Dupin, while I merely laughed at his&#10;last observations, &quot;that if the Minister had been no more than a&#10;mathematician, the Prefect would have been under no necessity of giving&#10;me this check. I know him, however, as both mathematician and poet,&#10;and my measures were adapted to his capacity, with reference to the&#10;circumstances by which he was surrounded. I knew him as a courtier, too,&#10;and as a bold intriguant. Such a man, I considered, could not fail to be&#10;aware of the ordinary policial modes of action. He could not have&#10;failed to anticipate--and events have proved that he did not fail to&#10;anticipate--the waylayings to which he was subjected. He must have&#10;foreseen, I reflected, the secret investigations of his premises. His&#10;frequent absences from home at night, which were hailed by the Prefect&#10;as certain aids to his success, I regarded only as ruses, to afford&#10;opportunity for thorough search to the police, and thus the sooner to&#10;impress them with the conviction to which G--, in fact, did finally&#10;arrive--the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises. I&#10;felt, also, that the whole train of thought, which I was at some pains&#10;in detailing to you just now, concerning the invariable principle of&#10;policial action in searches for articles concealed--I felt that this&#10;whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the&#10;Minister. It would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary&#10;nooks of concealment. He could not, I reflected, be so weak as not to&#10;see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be&#10;as open as his commonest closets to the eyes, to the probes, to the&#10;gimlets, and to the microscopes of the Prefect. I saw, in fine, that&#10;he would be driven, as a matter of course, to simplicity, if not&#10;deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice. You will remember,&#10;perhaps, how desperately the Prefect laughed when I suggested, upon our&#10;first interview, that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so&#10;much on account of its being so very self-evident.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; said I, &quot;I remember his merriment well. I really thought he would&#10;have fallen into convulsions.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The material world,&quot; continued Dupin, &quot;abounds with very strict&#10;analogies to the immaterial; and thus some color of truth has been&#10;given to the rhetorical dogma, that metaphor, or simile, may be made&#10;to strengthen an argument, as well as to embellish a description. The&#10;principle of the vis inertiÃ¦, for example, seems to be identical in&#10;physics and metaphysics. It is not more true in the former, that a large&#10;body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one, and that&#10;its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty, than it&#10;is, in the latter, that intellects of the vaster capacity, while more&#10;forcible, more constant, and more eventful in their movements than those&#10;of inferior grade, are yet the less readily moved, and more embarrassed&#10;and full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress. Again:&#10;have you ever noticed which of the street signs, over the shop-doors,&#10;are the most attractive of attention?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have never given the matter a thought,&quot; I said.&#10;&#10;&quot;There is a game of puzzles,&quot; he resumed, &quot;which is played upon a map.&#10;One party playing requires another to find a given word--the name of&#10;town, river, state or empire--any word, in short, upon the motley and&#10;perplexed surface of the chart. A novice in the game generally seeks to&#10;embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names;&#10;but the adept selects such words as stretch, in large characters, from&#10;one end of the chart to the other. These, like the over-largely lettered&#10;signs and placards of the street, escape observation by dint of being&#10;excessively obvious; and here the physical oversight is precisely&#10;analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers&#10;to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too&#10;palpably self-evident. But this is a point, it appears, somewhat above&#10;or beneath the understanding of the Prefect. He never once thought&#10;it probable, or possible, that the Minister had deposited the letter&#10;immediately beneath the nose of the whole world, by way of best&#10;preventing any portion of that world from perceiving it.&#10;&#10;&quot;But the more I reflected upon the daring, dashing, and discriminating&#10;ingenuity of D--; upon the fact that the document must always have been&#10;at hand, if he intended to use it to good purpose; and upon the decisive&#10;evidence, obtained by the Prefect, that it was not hidden within the&#10;limits of that dignitary's ordinary search--the more satisfied I&#10;became that, to conceal this letter, the Minister had resorted to the&#10;comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at&#10;all.&#10;&#10;&quot;Full of these ideas, I prepared myself with a pair of green spectacles,&#10;and called one fine morning, quite by accident, at the Ministerial&#10;hotel. I found D-- at home, yawning, lounging, and dawdling, as usual,&#10;and pretending to be in the last extremity of ennui. He is, perhaps,&#10;the most really energetic human being now alive--but that is only when&#10;nobody sees him.&#10;&#10;&quot;To be even with him, I complained of my weak eyes, and lamented the&#10;necessity of the spectacles, under cover of which I cautiously and&#10;thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment, while seemingly intent only&#10;upon the conversation of my host.&#10;&#10;&quot;I paid especial attention to a large writing-table near which he sat,&#10;and upon which lay confusedly, some miscellaneous letters and other&#10;papers, with one or two musical instruments and a few books. Here,&#10;however, after a long and very deliberate scrutiny, I saw nothing to&#10;excite particular suspicion.&#10;&#10;&quot;At length my eyes, in going the circuit of the room, fell upon a&#10;trumpery fillagree card-rack of pasteboard, that hung dangling by a&#10;dirty blue ribbon, from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of&#10;the mantel-piece. In this rack, which had three or four compartments,&#10;were five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter. This last&#10;was much soiled and crumpled. It was torn nearly in two, across the&#10;middle--as if a design, in the first instance, to tear it entirely up&#10;as worthless, had been altered, or stayed, in the second. It had a&#10;large black seal, bearing the D-- cipher very conspicuously, and was&#10;addressed, in a diminutive female hand, to D--, the minister, himself.&#10;It was thrust carelessly, and even, as it seemed, contemptuously, into&#10;one of the uppermost divisions of the rack.&#10;&#10;&quot;No sooner had I glanced at this letter, than I concluded it to be&#10;that of which I was in search. To be sure, it was, to all appearance,&#10;radically different from the one of which the Prefect had read us so&#10;minute a description. Here the seal was large and black, with the D--&#10;cipher; there it was small and red, with the ducal arms of the S--&#10;family. Here, the address, to the Minister, diminutive and feminine;&#10;there the superscription, to a certain royal personage, was markedly&#10;bold and decided; the size alone formed a point of correspondence. But,&#10;then, the radicalness of these differences, which was excessive; the&#10;dirt; the soiled and torn condition of the paper, so inconsistent with&#10;the true methodical habits of D--, and so suggestive of a design to&#10;delude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the document;&#10;these things, together with the hyper-obtrusive situation of this&#10;document, full in the view of every visiter, and thus exactly in&#10;accordance with the conclusions to which I had previously arrived; these&#10;things, I say, were strongly corroborative of suspicion, in one who came&#10;with the intention to suspect.&#10;&#10;&quot;I protracted my visit as long as possible, and, while I maintained a&#10;most animated discussion with the Minister upon a topic which I knew&#10;well had never failed to interest and excite him, I kept my attention&#10;really riveted upon the letter. In this examination, I committed to&#10;memory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack; and also&#10;fell, at length, upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial&#10;doubt I might have entertained. In scrutinizing the edges of the paper,&#10;I observed them to be more chafed than seemed necessary. They presented&#10;the broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper, having&#10;been once folded and pressed with a folder, is refolded in a reversed&#10;direction, in the same creases or edges which had formed the original&#10;fold. This discovery was sufficient. It was clear to me that the letter&#10;had been turned, as a glove, inside out, re-directed, and re-sealed. I&#10;bade the Minister good morning, and took my departure at once, leaving a&#10;gold snuff-box upon the table.&#10;&#10;&quot;The next morning I called for the snuff-box, when we resumed, quite&#10;eagerly, the conversation of the preceding day. While thus engaged,&#10;however, a loud report, as if of a pistol, was heard immediately beneath&#10;the windows of the hotel, and was succeeded by a series of fearful&#10;screams, and the shoutings of a terrified mob. D-- rushed to a casement,&#10;threw it open, and looked out. In the meantime, I stepped to the&#10;card-rack, took the letter, put it in my pocket, and replaced it by&#10;a fac-simile, (so far as regards externals,) which I had carefully&#10;prepared at my lodgings--imitating the D-- cipher, very readily, by&#10;means of a seal formed of bread.&#10;&#10;&quot;The disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic&#10;behavior of a man with a musket. He had fired it among a crowd of women&#10;and children. It proved, however, to have been without ball, and the&#10;fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard. When&#10;he had gone, D-- came from the window, whither I had followed him&#10;immediately upon securing the object in view. Soon afterwards I bade him&#10;farewell. The pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But what purpose had you,&quot; I asked, &quot;in replacing the letter by a&#10;fac-simile? Would it not have been better, at the first visit, to have&#10;seized it openly, and departed?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;D--,&quot; replied Dupin, &quot;is a desperate man, and a man of nerve. His&#10;hotel, too, is not without attendants devoted to his interests. Had&#10;I made the wild attempt you suggest, I might never have left the&#10;Ministerial presence alive. The good people of Paris might have heard&#10;of me no more. But I had an object apart from these considerations. You&#10;know my political prepossessions. In this matter, I act as a partisan of&#10;the lady concerned. For eighteen months the Minister has had her in his&#10;power. She has now him in hers--since, being unaware that the letter is&#10;not in his possession, he will proceed with his exactions as if it&#10;was. Thus will he inevitably commit himself, at once, to his political&#10;destruction. His downfall, too, will not be more precipitate than&#10;awkward. It is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus Averni;&#10;but in all kinds of climbing, as Catalani said of singing, it is far&#10;more easy to get up than to come down. In the present instance I have&#10;no sympathy--at least no pity--for him who descends. He is that monstrum&#10;horrendum, an unprincipled man of genius. I confess, however, that I&#10;should like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts,&#10;when, being defied by her whom the Prefect terms 'a certain personage'&#10;he is reduced to opening the letter which I left for him in the&#10;card-rack.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How? did you put any thing particular in it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why--it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blank--that&#10;would have been insulting. D--, at Vienna once, did me an evil turn,&#10;which I told him, quite good-humoredly, that I should remember. So, as&#10;I knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of the&#10;person who had outwitted him, I thought it a pity not to give him a&#10;clue. He is well acquainted with my MS., and I just copied into the&#10;middle of the blank sheet the words--&#10;&#10;&quot;'-- -- Un dessein si funeste, S'il n'est digne d'AtrÃ©e, est digne de&#10;Thyeste. They are to be found in Crebillon's 'AtrÃ©e.'&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;THE THOUSAND-AND-SECOND TALE OF SCHEHERAZADE&#10;&#10;                     Truth is stranger than fiction.&#10;&#10;                              OLD SAYING.&#10;&#10;HAVING had occasion, lately, in the course of some Oriental&#10;investigations, to consult the Tellmenow Isitsoornot, a work which (like&#10;the Zohar of Simeon Jochaides) is scarcely known at all, even in Europe;&#10;and which has never been quoted, to my knowledge, by any American--if&#10;we except, perhaps, the author of the &quot;Curiosities of American&#10;Literature&quot;;--having had occasion, I say, to turn over some pages of the&#10;first-mentioned very remarkable work, I was not a little astonished to&#10;discover that the literary world has hitherto been strangely in error&#10;respecting the fate of the vizier's daughter, Scheherazade, as that&#10;fate is depicted in the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;; and that the denouement there&#10;given, if not altogether inaccurate, as far as it goes, is at least to&#10;blame in not having gone very much farther.&#10;&#10;For full information on this interesting topic, I must refer the&#10;inquisitive reader to the &quot;Isitsoornot&quot; itself, but in the meantime, I&#10;shall be pardoned for giving a summary of what I there discovered.&#10;&#10;It will be remembered, that, in the usual version of the tales, a&#10;certain monarch having good cause to be jealous of his queen, not only&#10;puts her to death, but makes a vow, by his beard and the prophet, to&#10;espouse each night the most beautiful maiden in his dominions, and the&#10;next morning to deliver her up to the executioner.&#10;&#10;Having fulfilled this vow for many years to the letter, and with a&#10;religious punctuality and method that conferred great credit upon him&#10;as a man of devout feeling and excellent sense, he was interrupted one&#10;afternoon (no doubt at his prayers) by a visit from his grand vizier, to&#10;whose daughter, it appears, there had occurred an idea.&#10;&#10;Her name was Scheherazade, and her idea was, that she would either&#10;redeem the land from the depopulating tax upon its beauty, or perish,&#10;after the approved fashion of all heroines, in the attempt.&#10;&#10;Accordingly, and although we do not find it to be leap-year (which&#10;makes the sacrifice more meritorious), she deputes her father, the grand&#10;vizier, to make an offer to the king of her hand. This hand the king&#10;eagerly accepts--(he had intended to take it at all events, and had put&#10;off the matter from day to day, only through fear of the vizier),--but,&#10;in accepting it now, he gives all parties very distinctly to understand,&#10;that, grand vizier or no grand vizier, he has not the slightest design&#10;of giving up one iota of his vow or of his privileges. When, therefore,&#10;the fair Scheherazade insisted upon marrying the king, and did actually&#10;marry him despite her father's excellent advice not to do any thing of&#10;the kind--when she would and did marry him, I say, will I, nill I, it&#10;was with her beautiful black eyes as thoroughly open as the nature of&#10;the case would allow.&#10;&#10;It seems, however, that this politic damsel (who had been reading&#10;Machiavelli, beyond doubt), had a very ingenious little plot in her&#10;mind. On the night of the wedding, she contrived, upon I forget what&#10;specious pretence, to have her sister occupy a couch sufficiently near&#10;that of the royal pair to admit of easy conversation from bed to bed;&#10;and, a little before cock-crowing, she took care to awaken the good&#10;monarch, her husband (who bore her none the worse will because he&#10;intended to wring her neck on the morrow),--she managed to awaken him, I&#10;say, (although on account of a capital conscience and an easy digestion,&#10;he slept well) by the profound interest of a story (about a rat and a&#10;black cat, I think) which she was narrating (all in an undertone, of&#10;course) to her sister. When the day broke, it so happened that this&#10;history was not altogether finished, and that Scheherazade, in the&#10;nature of things could not finish it just then, since it was high time&#10;for her to get up and be bowstrung--a thing very little more pleasant&#10;than hanging, only a trifle more genteel.&#10;&#10;The king's curiosity, however, prevailing, I am sorry to say, even over&#10;his sound religious principles, induced him for this once to postpone&#10;the fulfilment of his vow until next morning, for the purpose and with&#10;the hope of hearing that night how it fared in the end with the black&#10;cat (a black cat, I think it was) and the rat.&#10;&#10;The night having arrived, however, the lady Scheherazade not only put&#10;the finishing stroke to the black cat and the rat (the rat was blue)&#10;but before she well knew what she was about, found herself deep in the&#10;intricacies of a narration, having reference (if I am not altogether&#10;mistaken) to a pink horse (with green wings) that went, in a violent&#10;manner, by clockwork, and was wound up with an indigo key. With this&#10;history the king was even more profoundly interested than with the&#10;other--and, as the day broke before its conclusion (notwithstanding&#10;all the queen's endeavors to get through with it in time for the&#10;bowstringing), there was again no resource but to postpone that ceremony&#10;as before, for twenty-four hours. The next night there happened a&#10;similar accident with a similar result; and then the next--and then&#10;again the next; so that, in the end, the good monarch, having been&#10;unavoidably deprived of all opportunity to keep his vow during a&#10;period of no less than one thousand and one nights, either forgets it&#10;altogether by the expiration of this time, or gets himself absolved of&#10;it in the regular way, or (what is more probable) breaks it outright, as&#10;well as the head of his father confessor. At all events, Scheherazade,&#10;who, being lineally descended from Eve, fell heir, perhaps, to the whole&#10;seven baskets of talk, which the latter lady, we all know, picked up&#10;from under the trees in the garden of Eden--Scheherazade, I say, finally&#10;triumphed, and the tariff upon beauty was repealed.&#10;&#10;Now, this conclusion (which is that of the story as we have it upon&#10;record) is, no doubt, excessively proper and pleasant--but alas! like&#10;a great many pleasant things, is more pleasant than true, and I am&#10;indebted altogether to the &quot;Isitsoornot&quot; for the means of correcting the&#10;error. &quot;Le mieux,&quot; says a French proverb, &quot;est l'ennemi du bien,&quot; and,&#10;in mentioning that Scheherazade had inherited the seven baskets of talk,&#10;I should have added that she put them out at compound interest until&#10;they amounted to seventy-seven.&#10;&#10;&quot;My dear sister,&quot; said she, on the thousand-and-second night, (I quote&#10;the language of the &quot;Isitsoornot&quot; at this point, verbatim) &quot;my dear&#10;sister,&quot; said she, &quot;now that all this little difficulty about the&#10;bowstring has blown over, and that this odious tax is so happily&#10;repealed, I feel that I have been guilty of great indiscretion in&#10;withholding from you and the king (who I am sorry to say, snores--a&#10;thing no gentleman would do) the full conclusion of Sinbad the sailor.&#10;This person went through numerous other and more interesting adventures&#10;than those which I related; but the truth is, I felt sleepy on the&#10;particular night of their narration, and so was seduced into cutting&#10;them short--a grievous piece of misconduct, for which I only trust that&#10;Allah will forgive me. But even yet it is not too late to remedy my&#10;great neglect--and as soon as I have given the king a pinch or two in&#10;order to wake him up so far that he may stop making that horrible noise,&#10;I will forthwith entertain you (and him if he pleases) with the sequel&#10;of this very remarkable story.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hereupon the sister of Scheherazade, as I have it from the&#10;&quot;Isitsoornot,&quot; expressed no very particular intensity of gratification;&#10;but the king, having been sufficiently pinched, at length ceased&#10;snoring, and finally said, &quot;hum!&quot; and then &quot;hoo!&quot; when the queen,&#10;understanding these words (which are no doubt Arabic) to signify that&#10;he was all attention, and would do his best not to snore any more--the&#10;queen, I say, having arranged these matters to her satisfaction,&#10;re-entered thus, at once, into the history of Sinbad the sailor:&#10;&#10;&quot;'At length, in my old age,' [these are the words of Sinbad himself, as&#10;retailed by Scheherazade]--'at length, in my old age, and after enjoying&#10;many years of tranquillity at home, I became once more possessed of a&#10;desire of visiting foreign countries; and one day, without acquainting&#10;any of my family with my design, I packed up some bundles of such&#10;merchandise as was most precious and least bulky, and, engaged a porter&#10;to carry them, went with him down to the sea-shore, to await the arrival&#10;of any chance vessel that might convey me out of the kingdom into some&#10;region which I had not as yet explored.&#10;&#10;&quot;'Having deposited the packages upon the sands, we sat down beneath some&#10;trees, and looked out into the ocean in the hope of perceiving a ship,&#10;but during several hours we saw none whatever. At length I fancied that&#10;I could hear a singular buzzing or humming sound; and the porter, after&#10;listening awhile, declared that he also could distinguish it. Presently&#10;it grew louder, and then still louder, so that we could have no doubt&#10;that the object which caused it was approaching us. At length, on&#10;the edge of the horizon, we discovered a black speck, which rapidly&#10;increased in size until we made it out to be a vast monster, swimming&#10;with a great part of its body above the surface of the sea. It came&#10;toward us with inconceivable swiftness, throwing up huge waves of foam&#10;around its breast, and illuminating all that part of the sea through&#10;which it passed, with a long line of fire that extended far off into the&#10;distance.&#10;&#10;&quot;'As the thing drew near we saw it very distinctly. Its length was equal&#10;to that of three of the loftiest trees that grow, and it was as wide as&#10;the great hall of audience in your palace, O most sublime and munificent&#10;of the Caliphs. Its body, which was unlike that of ordinary fishes, was&#10;as solid as a rock, and of a jetty blackness throughout all that portion&#10;of it which floated above the water, with the exception of a narrow&#10;blood-red streak that completely begirdled it. The belly, which floated&#10;beneath the surface, and of which we could get only a glimpse now and&#10;then as the monster rose and fell with the billows, was entirely covered&#10;with metallic scales, of a color like that of the moon in misty weather.&#10;The back was flat and nearly white, and from it there extended upwards&#10;of six spines, about half the length of the whole body.&#10;&#10;&quot;'The horrible creature had no mouth that we could perceive, but, as if&#10;to make up for this deficiency, it was provided with at least four&#10;score of eyes, that protruded from their sockets like those of the green&#10;dragon-fly, and were arranged all around the body in two rows, one above&#10;the other, and parallel to the blood-red streak, which seemed to answer&#10;the purpose of an eyebrow. Two or three of these dreadful eyes were much&#10;larger than the others, and had the appearance of solid gold.&#10;&#10;&quot;'Although this beast approached us, as I have before said, with the&#10;greatest rapidity, it must have been moved altogether by necromancy--for&#10;it had neither fins like a fish nor web-feet like a duck, nor wings like&#10;the seashell which is blown along in the manner of a vessel; nor yet&#10;did it writhe itself forward as do the eels. Its head and its tail were&#10;shaped precisely alike, only, not far from the latter, were two small&#10;holes that served for nostrils, and through which the monster puffed&#10;out its thick breath with prodigious violence, and with a shrieking,&#10;disagreeable noise.&#10;&#10;&quot;'Our terror at beholding this hideous thing was very great, but it was&#10;even surpassed by our astonishment, when upon getting a nearer look, we&#10;perceived upon the creature's back a vast number of animals about the&#10;size and shape of men, and altogether much resembling them, except that&#10;they wore no garments (as men do), being supplied (by nature, no doubt)&#10;with an ugly uncomfortable covering, a good deal like cloth, but fitting&#10;so tight to the skin, as to render the poor wretches laughably awkward,&#10;and put them apparently to severe pain. On the very tips of their heads&#10;were certain square-looking boxes, which, at first sight, I thought&#10;might have been intended to answer as turbans, but I soon discovered&#10;that they were excessively heavy and solid, and I therefore concluded&#10;they were contrivances designed, by their great weight, to keep the&#10;heads of the animals steady and safe upon their shoulders. Around&#10;the necks of the creatures were fastened black collars, (badges of&#10;servitude, no doubt,) such as we keep on our dogs, only much wider&#10;and infinitely stiffer, so that it was quite impossible for these poor&#10;victims to move their heads in any direction without moving the body at&#10;the same time; and thus they were doomed to perpetual contemplation of&#10;their noses--a view puggish and snubby in a wonderful, if not positively&#10;in an awful degree.&#10;&#10;&quot;'When the monster had nearly reached the shore where we stood, it&#10;suddenly pushed out one of its eyes to a great extent, and emitted from&#10;it a terrible flash of fire, accompanied by a dense cloud of smoke, and&#10;a noise that I can compare to nothing but thunder. As the smoke cleared&#10;away, we saw one of the odd man-animals standing near the head of the&#10;large beast with a trumpet in his hand, through which (putting it to&#10;his mouth) he presently addressed us in loud, harsh, and disagreeable&#10;accents, that, perhaps, we should have mistaken for language, had they&#10;not come altogether through the nose.&#10;&#10;&quot;'Being thus evidently spoken to, I was at a loss how to reply, as I&#10;could in no manner understand what was said; and in this difficulty&#10;I turned to the porter, who was near swooning through affright, and&#10;demanded of him his opinion as to what species of monster it was, what&#10;it wanted, and what kind of creatures those were that so swarmed&#10;upon its back. To this the porter replied, as well as he could for&#10;trepidation, that he had once before heard of this sea-beast; that it&#10;was a cruel demon, with bowels of sulphur and blood of fire, created&#10;by evil genii as the means of inflicting misery upon mankind; that the&#10;things upon its back were vermin, such as sometimes infest cats and&#10;dogs, only a little larger and more savage; and that these vermin had&#10;their uses, however evil--for, through the torture they caused the beast&#10;by their nibbling and stingings, it was goaded into that degree of wrath&#10;which was requisite to make it roar and commit ill, and so fulfil the&#10;vengeful and malicious designs of the wicked genii.&#10;&#10;&quot;This account determined me to take to my heels, and, without once even&#10;looking behind me, I ran at full speed up into the hills, while the&#10;porter ran equally fast, although nearly in an opposite direction, so&#10;that, by these means, he finally made his escape with my bundles, of&#10;which I have no doubt he took excellent care--although this is a point I&#10;cannot determine, as I do not remember that I ever beheld him again.&#10;&#10;&quot;'For myself, I was so hotly pursued by a swarm of the men-vermin (who&#10;had come to the shore in boats) that I was very soon overtaken, bound&#10;hand and foot, and conveyed to the beast, which immediately swam out&#10;again into the middle of the sea.&#10;&#10;&quot;'I now bitterly repented my folly in quitting a comfortable home to&#10;peril my life in such adventures as this; but regret being useless, I&#10;made the best of my condition, and exerted myself to secure the goodwill&#10;of the man-animal that owned the trumpet, and who appeared to exercise&#10;authority over his fellows. I succeeded so well in this endeavor that,&#10;in a few days, the creature bestowed upon me various tokens of his&#10;favor, and in the end even went to the trouble of teaching me the&#10;rudiments of what it was vain enough to denominate its language; so&#10;that, at length, I was enabled to converse with it readily, and came to&#10;make it comprehend the ardent desire I had of seeing the world.&#10;&#10;&quot;'Washish squashish squeak, Sinbad, hey-diddle diddle, grunt unt&#10;grumble, hiss, fiss, whiss,' said he to me, one day after dinner--but&#10;I beg a thousand pardons, I had forgotten that your majesty is not&#10;conversant with the dialect of the Cock-neighs (so the man-animals were&#10;called; I presume because their language formed the connecting&#10;link between that of the horse and that of the rooster). With your&#10;permission, I will translate. 'Washish squashish,' and so forth:--that&#10;is to say, 'I am happy to find, my dear Sinbad, that you are really a&#10;very excellent fellow; we are now about doing a thing which is called&#10;circumnavigating the globe; and since you are so desirous of seeing the&#10;world, I will strain a point and give you a free passage upon back of&#10;the beast.'&quot;&#10;&#10;When the Lady Scheherazade had proceeded thus far, relates the&#10;&quot;Isitsoornot,&quot; the king turned over from his left side to his right, and&#10;said:&#10;&#10;&quot;It is, in fact, very surprising, my dear queen, that you omitted,&#10;hitherto, these latter adventures of Sinbad. Do you know I think them&#10;exceedingly entertaining and strange?&quot;&#10;&#10;The king having thus expressed himself, we are told, the fair&#10;Scheherazade resumed her history in the following words:&#10;&#10;&quot;Sinbad went on in this manner with his narrative to the caliph--'I&#10;thanked the man-animal for its kindness, and soon found myself very much&#10;at home on the beast, which swam at a prodigious rate through the ocean;&#10;although the surface of the latter is, in that part of the world, by&#10;no means flat, but round like a pomegranate, so that we went--so to&#10;say--either up hill or down hill all the time.'&#10;&#10;&quot;That I think, was very singular,&quot; interrupted the king.&#10;&#10;&quot;Nevertheless, it is quite true,&quot; replied Scheherazade.&#10;&#10;&quot;I have my doubts,&quot; rejoined the king; &quot;but, pray, be so good as to go&#10;on with the story.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I will,&quot; said the queen. &quot;'The beast,' continued Sinbad to the caliph,&#10;'swam, as I have related, up hill and down hill until, at length, we&#10;arrived at an island, many hundreds of miles in circumference, but&#10;which, nevertheless, had been built in the middle of the sea by a colony&#10;of little things like caterpillars'&quot; (*1)&#10;&#10;&quot;Hum!&quot; said the king.&#10;&#10;&quot;'Leaving this island,' said Sinbad--(for Scheherazade, it must be&#10;understood, took no notice of her husband's ill-mannered ejaculation)&#10;'leaving this island, we came to another where the forests were of solid&#10;stone, and so hard that they shivered to pieces the finest-tempered axes&#10;with which we endeavoured to cut them down.&quot;' (*2)&#10;&#10;&quot;Hum!&quot; said the king, again; but Scheherazade, paying him no attention,&#10;continued in the language of Sinbad.&#10;&#10;&quot;'Passing beyond this last island, we reached a country where there&#10;was a cave that ran to the distance of thirty or forty miles within the&#10;bowels of the earth, and that contained a greater number of far more&#10;spacious and more magnificent palaces than are to be found in all&#10;Damascus and Bagdad. From the roofs of these palaces there hung myriads&#10;of gems, like diamonds, but larger than men; and in among the streets&#10;of towers and pyramids and temples, there flowed immense rivers as black&#10;as ebony, and swarming with fish that had no eyes.'&quot; (*3)&#10;&#10;&quot;Hum!&quot; said the king. &quot;'We then swam into a region of the sea where&#10;we found a lofty mountain, down whose sides there streamed torrents of&#10;melted metal, some of which were twelve miles wide and sixty miles long&#10;(*4); while from an abyss on the summit, issued so vast a quantity of&#10;ashes that the sun was entirely blotted out from the heavens, and it&#10;became darker than the darkest midnight; so that when we were even at&#10;the distance of a hundred and fifty miles from the mountain, it was&#10;impossible to see the whitest object, however close we held it to our&#10;eyes.'&quot; (*5)&#10;&#10;&quot;Hum!&quot; said the king.&#10;&#10;&quot;'After quitting this coast, the beast continued his voyage until we met&#10;with a land in which the nature of things seemed reversed--for we here&#10;saw a great lake, at the bottom of which, more than a hundred feet&#10;beneath the surface of the water, there flourished in full leaf a forest&#10;of tall and luxuriant trees.'&quot; (*6)&#10;&#10;&quot;Hoo!&quot; said the king.&#10;&#10;&quot;Some hundred miles farther on brought us to a climate where the&#10;atmosphere was so dense as to sustain iron or steel, just as our own&#10;does feather.'&quot; (*7)&#10;&#10;&quot;Fiddle de dee,&quot; said the king.&#10;&#10;&quot;Proceeding still in the same direction, we presently arrived at the&#10;most magnificent region in the whole world. Through it there meandered&#10;a glorious river for several thousands of miles. This river was of&#10;unspeakable depth, and of a transparency richer than that of amber.&#10;It was from three to six miles in width; and its banks which arose on&#10;either side to twelve hundred feet in perpendicular height, were crowned&#10;with ever-blossoming trees and perpetual sweet-scented flowers, that&#10;made the whole territory one gorgeous garden; but the name of this&#10;luxuriant land was the Kingdom of Horror, and to enter it was inevitable&#10;death'&quot; (*8)&#10;&#10;&quot;Humph!&quot; said the king.&#10;&#10;&quot;'We left this kingdom in great haste, and, after some days, came to&#10;another, where we were astonished to perceive myriads of monstrous&#10;animals with horns resembling scythes upon their heads. These hideous&#10;beasts dig for themselves vast caverns in the soil, of a funnel shape,&#10;and line the sides of them with rocks, so disposed one upon the other&#10;that they fall instantly, when trodden upon by other animals, thus&#10;precipitating them into the monster's dens, where their blood is&#10;immediately sucked, and their carcasses afterwards hurled contemptuously&#10;out to an immense distance from &quot;the caverns of death.&quot;'&quot; (*9)&#10;&#10;&quot;Pooh!&quot; said the king.&#10;&#10;&quot;'Continuing our progress, we perceived a district with vegetables that&#10;grew not upon any soil but in the air. (*10) There were others that&#10;sprang from the substance of other vegetables; (*11) others that derived&#10;their substance from the bodies of living animals; (*12) and then again,&#10;there were others that glowed all over with intense fire; (*13) others&#10;that moved from place to place at pleasure, (*14) and what was still&#10;more wonderful, we discovered flowers that lived and breathed and moved&#10;their limbs at will and had, moreover, the detestable passion of mankind&#10;for enslaving other creatures, and confining them in horrid and solitary&#10;prisons until the fulfillment of appointed tasks.'&quot; (*15)&#10;&#10;&quot;Pshaw!&quot; said the king.&#10;&#10;&quot;'Quitting this land, we soon arrived at another in which the bees and&#10;the birds are mathematicians of such genius and erudition, that they&#10;give daily instructions in the science of geometry to the wise men&#10;of the empire. The king of the place having offered a reward for the&#10;solution of two very difficult problems, they were solved upon the&#10;spot--the one by the bees, and the other by the birds; but the king&#10;keeping their solution a secret, it was only after the most profound&#10;researches and labor, and the writing of an infinity of big books,&#10;during a long series of years, that the men-mathematicians at length&#10;arrived at the identical solutions which had been given upon the spot by&#10;the bees and by the birds.'&quot; (*16)&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh my!&quot; said the king.&#10;&#10;&quot;'We had scarcely lost sight of this empire when we found ourselves&#10;close upon another, from whose shores there flew over our heads a flock&#10;of fowls a mile in breadth, and two hundred and forty miles long; so&#10;that, although they flew a mile during every minute, it required no less&#10;than four hours for the whole flock to pass over us--in which there were&#10;several millions of millions of fowl.'&quot; (*17)&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh fy!&quot; said the king.&#10;&#10;&quot;'No sooner had we got rid of these birds, which occasioned us great&#10;annoyance, than we were terrified by the appearance of a fowl of another&#10;kind, and infinitely larger than even the rocs which I met in my&#10;former voyages; for it was bigger than the biggest of the domes on your&#10;seraglio, oh, most Munificent of Caliphs. This terrible fowl had no head&#10;that we could perceive, but was fashioned entirely of belly, which was&#10;of a prodigious fatness and roundness, of a soft-looking substance,&#10;smooth, shining and striped with various colors. In its talons, the&#10;monster was bearing away to his eyrie in the heavens, a house from which&#10;it had knocked off the roof, and in the interior of which we distinctly&#10;saw human beings, who, beyond doubt, were in a state of frightful&#10;despair at the horrible fate which awaited them. We shouted with all our&#10;might, in the hope of frightening the bird into letting go of its prey,&#10;but it merely gave a snort or puff, as if of rage and then let fall upon&#10;our heads a heavy sack which proved to be filled with sand!'&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Stuff!&quot; said the king.&#10;&#10;&quot;'It was just after this adventure that we encountered a continent of&#10;immense extent and prodigious solidity, but which, nevertheless, was&#10;supported entirely upon the back of a sky-blue cow that had no fewer&#10;than four hundred horns.'&quot; (*18)&#10;&#10;&quot;That, now, I believe,&quot; said the king, &quot;because I have read something of&#10;the kind before, in a book.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;'We passed immediately beneath this continent, (swimming in between the&#10;legs of the cow), and, after some hours, found ourselves in a wonderful&#10;country indeed, which, I was informed by the man-animal, was his own&#10;native land, inhabited by things of his own species. This elevated the&#10;man-animal very much in my esteem, and in fact, I now began to feel&#10;ashamed of the contemptuous familiarity with which I had treated him;&#10;for I found that the man-animals in general were a nation of the most&#10;powerful magicians, who lived with worms in their brain, (*19) which,&#10;no doubt, served to stimulate them by their painful writhings and&#10;wrigglings to the most miraculous efforts of imagination!'&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Nonsense!&quot; said the king.&#10;&#10;&quot;'Among the magicians, were domesticated several animals of very&#10;singular kinds; for example, there was a huge horse whose bones were&#10;iron and whose blood was boiling water. In place of corn, he had black&#10;stones for his usual food; and yet, in spite of so hard a diet, he was&#10;so strong and swift that he would drag a load more weighty than the&#10;grandest temple in this city, at a rate surpassing that of the flight of&#10;most birds.'&quot; (*20)&#10;&#10;&quot;Twattle!&quot; said the king.&#10;&#10;&quot;'I saw, also, among these people a hen without feathers, but bigger&#10;than a camel; instead of flesh and bone she had iron and brick; her&#10;blood, like that of the horse, (to whom, in fact, she was nearly&#10;related,) was boiling water; and like him she ate nothing but wood or&#10;black stones. This hen brought forth very frequently, a hundred chickens&#10;in the day; and, after birth, they took up their residence for several&#10;weeks within the stomach of their mother.'&quot; (*21)&#10;&#10;&quot;Fa! lal!&quot; said the king.&#10;&#10;&quot;'One of this nation of mighty conjurors created a man out of brass and&#10;wood, and leather, and endowed him with such ingenuity that he would&#10;have beaten at chess, all the race of mankind with the exception of the&#10;great Caliph, Haroun Alraschid. (*22) Another of these magi constructed&#10;(of like material) a creature that put to shame even the genius of him&#10;who made it; for so great were its reasoning powers that, in a second,&#10;it performed calculations of so vast an extent that they would have&#10;required the united labor of fifty thousand fleshy men for a year. (*23)&#10;But a still more wonderful conjuror fashioned for himself a mighty thing&#10;that was neither man nor beast, but which had brains of lead, intermixed&#10;with a black matter like pitch, and fingers that it employed with such&#10;incredible speed and dexterity that it would have had no trouble in&#10;writing out twenty thousand copies of the Koran in an hour, and this&#10;with so exquisite a precision, that in all the copies there should not&#10;be found one to vary from another by the breadth of the finest hair.&#10;This thing was of prodigious strength, so that it erected or overthrew&#10;the mightiest empires at a breath; but its powers were exercised equally&#10;for evil and for good.'&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ridiculous!&quot; said the king.&#10;&#10;&quot;'Among this nation of necromancers there was also one who had in his&#10;veins the blood of the salamanders; for he made no scruple of sitting&#10;down to smoke his chibouc in a red-hot oven until his dinner was&#10;thoroughly roasted upon its floor. (*24) Another had the faculty of&#10;converting the common metals into gold, without even looking at them&#10;during the process. (*25) Another had such a delicacy of touch that he&#10;made a wire so fine as to be invisible. (*26) Another had such quickness&#10;of perception that he counted all the separate motions of an elastic&#10;body, while it was springing backward and forward at the rate of nine&#10;hundred millions of times in a second.'&quot; (*27)&#10;&#10;&quot;Absurd!&quot; said the king.&#10;&#10;&quot;'Another of these magicians, by means of a fluid that nobody ever yet&#10;saw, could make the corpses of his friends brandish their arms, kick out&#10;their legs, fight, or even get up and dance at his will. (*28) Another&#10;had cultivated his voice to so great an extent that he could have made&#10;himself heard from one end of the world to the other. (*29) Another had&#10;so long an arm that he could sit down in Damascus and indite a letter&#10;at Bagdad--or indeed at any distance whatsoever. (*30) Another commanded&#10;the lightning to come down to him out of the heavens, and it came at his&#10;call; and served him for a plaything when it came. Another took two&#10;loud sounds and out of them made a silence. Another constructed a&#10;deep darkness out of two brilliant lights. (*31) Another made ice in a&#10;red-hot furnace. (*32) Another directed the sun to paint his portrait,&#10;and the sun did. (*33) Another took this luminary with the moon and the&#10;planets, and having first weighed them with scrupulous accuracy, probed&#10;into their depths and found out the solidity of the substance of which&#10;they were made. But the whole nation is, indeed, of so surprising a&#10;necromantic ability, that not even their infants, nor their commonest&#10;cats and dogs have any difficulty in seeing objects that do not exist at&#10;all, or that for twenty millions of years before the birth of the nation&#10;itself had been blotted out from the face of creation.&quot;' (*34)&#10;&#10;&quot;Preposterous!&quot; said the king.&#10;&#10;&quot;'The wives and daughters of these incomparably great and wise magi,'&quot;&#10;continued Scheherazade, without being in any manner disturbed by&#10;these frequent and most ungentlemanly interruptions on the part of her&#10;husband--&quot;'the wives and daughters of these eminent conjurers are every&#10;thing that is accomplished and refined; and would be every thing that is&#10;interesting and beautiful, but for an unhappy fatality that besets them,&#10;and from which not even the miraculous powers of their husbands and&#10;fathers has, hitherto, been adequate to save. Some fatalities come in&#10;certain shapes, and some in others--but this of which I speak has come&#10;in the shape of a crotchet.'&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A what?&quot; said the king.&#10;&#10;&quot;'A crotchet'&quot; said Scheherazade. &quot;'One of the evil genii, who are&#10;perpetually upon the watch to inflict ill, has put it into the heads of&#10;these accomplished ladies that the thing which we describe as personal&#10;beauty consists altogether in the protuberance of the region which lies&#10;not very far below the small of the back. Perfection of loveliness, they&#10;say, is in the direct ratio of the extent of this lump. Having been long&#10;possessed of this idea, and bolsters being cheap in that country, the&#10;days have long gone by since it was possible to distinguish a woman from&#10;a dromedary-'&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Stop!&quot; said the king--&quot;I can't stand that, and I won't. You have&#10;already given me a dreadful headache with your lies. The day, too, I&#10;perceive, is beginning to break. How long have we been married?--my&#10;conscience is getting to be troublesome again. And then that dromedary&#10;touch--do you take me for a fool? Upon the whole, you might as well get&#10;up and be throttled.&quot;&#10;&#10;These words, as I learn from the &quot;Isitsoornot,&quot; both grieved and&#10;astonished Scheherazade; but, as she knew the king to be a man of&#10;scrupulous integrity, and quite unlikely to forfeit his word, she&#10;submitted to her fate with a good grace. She derived, however, great&#10;consolation, (during the tightening of the bowstring,) from the&#10;reflection that much of the history remained still untold, and that the&#10;petulance of her brute of a husband had reaped for him a most righteous&#10;reward, in depriving him of many inconceivable adventures.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;A DESCENT INTO THE MAELSTRÃM.&#10;&#10;  The ways of God in Nature, as in Providence, are not as our&#10;  ways;  nor are the models that we frame any way commensurate to the&#10;  vastness, profundity, and unsearchableness of His works, which have&#10;  a depth in them greater than the well of Democritus.&#10;&#10;  Joseph Glanville.&#10;&#10;WE had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag. For some minutes the&#10;old man seemed too much exhausted to speak.&#10;&#10;&quot;Not long ago,&quot; said he at length, &quot;and I could have guided you on this&#10;route as well as the youngest of my sons; but, about three years past,&#10;there happened to me an event such as never happened to mortal man--or&#10;at least such as no man ever survived to tell of--and the six hours of&#10;deadly terror which I then endured have broken me up body and soul. You&#10;suppose me a _very_ old man--but I am not. It took less than a single&#10;day to change these hairs from a jetty black to white, to weaken&#10;my limbs, and to unstring my nerves, so that I tremble at the least&#10;exertion, and am frightened at a shadow. Do you know I can scarcely look&#10;over this little cliff without getting giddy?&quot;&#10;&#10;The &quot;little cliff,&quot; upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown himself&#10;down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung over it, while&#10;he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his elbow on its extreme&#10;and slippery edge--this &quot;little cliff&quot; arose, a sheer unobstructed&#10;precipice of black shining rock, some fifteen or sixteen hundred feet&#10;from the world of crags beneath us. Nothing would have tempted me to&#10;within half a dozen yards of its brink. In truth so deeply was I excited&#10;by the perilous position of my companion, that I fell at full length&#10;upon the ground, clung to the shrubs around me, and dared not even&#10;glance upward at the sky--while I struggled in vain to divest myself of&#10;the idea that the very foundations of the mountain were in danger from&#10;the fury of the winds. It was long before I could reason myself into&#10;sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the distance.&#10;&#10;&quot;You must get over these fancies,&quot; said the guide, &quot;for I have brought&#10;you here that you might have the best possible view of the scene of that&#10;event I mentioned--and to tell you the whole story with the spot just&#10;under your eye.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We are now,&quot; he continued, in that particularizing manner which&#10;distinguished him--&quot;we are now close upon the Norwegian coast--in the&#10;sixty-eighth degree of latitude--in the great province of Nordland--and&#10;in the dreary district of Lofoden. The mountain upon whose top we sit is&#10;Helseggen, the Cloudy. Now raise yourself up a little higher--hold on to&#10;the grass if you feel giddy--so--and look out, beyond the belt of vapor&#10;beneath us, into the sea.&quot;&#10;&#10;I looked dizzily, and beheld a wide expanse of ocean, whose waters wore&#10;so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the Nubian geographer's&#10;account of the _Mare Tenebrarum_. A panorama more deplorably desolate no&#10;human imagination can conceive. To the right and left, as far as the eye&#10;could reach, there lay outstretched, like ramparts of the world, lines&#10;of horridly black and beetling cliff, whose character of gloom was but&#10;the more forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up against&#10;its white and ghastly crest, howling and shrieking forever. Just&#10;opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed, and at a&#10;distance of some five or six miles out at sea, there was visible&#10;a small, bleak-looking island; or, more properly, its position was&#10;discernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was enveloped.&#10;About two miles nearer the land, arose another of smaller size,&#10;hideously craggy and barren, and encompassed at various intervals by a&#10;cluster of dark rocks.&#10;&#10;The appearance of the ocean, in the space between the more distant&#10;island and the shore, had something very unusual about it. Although,&#10;at the time, so strong a gale was blowing landward that a brig in the&#10;remote offing lay to under a double-reefed trysail, and constantly&#10;plunged her whole hull out of sight, still there was here nothing like a&#10;regular swell, but only a short, quick, angry cross dashing of water in&#10;every direction--as well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise. Of foam&#10;there was little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks.&#10;&#10;&quot;The island in the distance,&quot; resumed the old man, &quot;is called by&#10;the Norwegians Vurrgh. The one midway is Moskoe. That a mile to the&#10;northward is Ambaaren. Yonder are Islesen, Hotholm, Keildhelm, Suarven,&#10;and Buckholm. Farther off--between Moskoe and Vurrgh--are Otterholm,&#10;Flimen, Sandflesen, and Stockholm. These are the true names of the&#10;places--but why it has been thought necessary to name them at all, is&#10;more than either you or I can understand. Do you hear anything? Do you&#10;see any change in the water?&quot;&#10;&#10;We had now been about ten minutes upon the top of Helseggen, to which&#10;we had ascended from the interior of Lofoden, so that we had caught no&#10;glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from the summit. As the&#10;old man spoke, I became aware of a loud and gradually increasing sound,&#10;like the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an American prairie;&#10;and at the same moment I perceived that what seamen term the _chopping_&#10;character of the ocean beneath us, was rapidly changing into a current&#10;which set to the eastward. Even while I gazed, this current acquired&#10;a monstrous velocity. Each moment added to its speed--to its headlong&#10;impetuosity. In five minutes the whole sea, as far as Vurrgh, was lashed&#10;into ungovernable fury; but it was between Moskoe and the coast that the&#10;main uproar held its sway. Here the vast bed of the waters, seamed&#10;and scarred into a thousand conflicting channels, burst suddenly into&#10;phrensied convulsion--heaving, boiling, hissing--gyrating in gigantic&#10;and innumerable vortices, and all whirling and plunging on to the&#10;eastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes except in&#10;precipitous descents.&#10;&#10;In a few minutes more, there came over the scene another radical&#10;alteration. The general surface grew somewhat more smooth, and the&#10;whirlpools, one by one, disappeared, while prodigious streaks of foam&#10;became apparent where none had been seen before. These streaks,&#10;at length, spreading out to a great distance, and entering into&#10;combination, took unto themselves the gyratory motion of the&#10;subsided vortices, and seemed to form the germ of another more vast.&#10;Suddenly--very suddenly--this assumed a distinct and definite existence,&#10;in a circle of more than a mile in diameter. The edge of the whirl was&#10;represented by a broad belt of gleaming spray; but no particle of this&#10;slipped into the mouth of the terrific funnel, whose interior, as far&#10;as the eye could fathom it, was a smooth, shining, and jet-black wall of&#10;water, inclined to the horizon at an angle of some forty-five degrees,&#10;speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering motion,&#10;and sending forth to the winds an appalling voice, half shriek, half&#10;roar, such as not even the mighty cataract of Niagara ever lifts up in&#10;its agony to Heaven.&#10;&#10;The mountain trembled to its very base, and the rock rocked. I threw&#10;myself upon my face, and clung to the scant herbage in an excess of&#10;nervous agitation.&#10;&#10;&quot;This,&quot; said I at length, to the old man--&quot;this _can_ be nothing else&#10;than the great whirlpool of the MaelstrÃ¶m.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;So it is sometimes termed,&quot; said he. &quot;We Norwegians call it the&#10;Moskoe-strÃ¶m, from the island of Moskoe in the midway.&quot;&#10;&#10;The ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me&#10;for what I saw. That of Jonas Ramus, which is perhaps the most&#10;circumstantial of any, cannot impart the faintest conception either&#10;of the magnificence, or of the horror of the scene--or of the wild&#10;bewildering sense of _the novel_ which confounds the beholder. I am not&#10;sure from what point of view the writer in question surveyed it, nor at&#10;what time; but it could neither have been from the summit of Helseggen,&#10;nor during a storm. There are some passages of his description,&#10;nevertheless, which may be quoted for their details, although their&#10;effect is exceedingly feeble in conveying an impression of the&#10;spectacle.&#10;&#10;&quot;Between Lofoden and Moskoe,&quot; he says, &quot;the depth of the water is&#10;between thirty-six and forty fathoms; but on the other side, toward Ver&#10;(Vurrgh) this depth decreases so as not to afford a convenient passage&#10;for a vessel, without the risk of splitting on the rocks, which happens&#10;even in the calmest weather. When it is flood, the stream runs up the&#10;country between Lofoden and Moskoe with a boisterous rapidity; but the&#10;roar of its impetuous ebb to the sea is scarce equalled by the loudest&#10;and most dreadful cataracts; the noise being heard several leagues off,&#10;and the vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth, that if a ship&#10;comes within its attraction, it is inevitably absorbed and carried down&#10;to the bottom, and there beat to pieces against the rocks; and when&#10;the water relaxes, the fragments thereof are thrown up again. But these&#10;intervals of tranquility are only at the turn of the ebb and flood,&#10;and in calm weather, and last but a quarter of an hour, its violence&#10;gradually returning. When the stream is most boisterous, and its fury&#10;heightened by a storm, it is dangerous to come within a Norway mile&#10;of it. Boats, yachts, and ships have been carried away by not guarding&#10;against it before they were within its reach. It likewise happens&#10;frequently, that whales come too near the stream, and are overpowered by&#10;its violence; and then it is impossible to describe their howlings and&#10;bellowings in their fruitless struggles to disengage themselves. A&#10;bear once, attempting to swim from Lofoden to Moskoe, was caught by the&#10;stream and borne down, while he roared terribly, so as to be heard on&#10;shore. Large stocks of firs and pine trees, after being absorbed by the&#10;current, rise again broken and torn to such a degree as if bristles grew&#10;upon them. This plainly shows the bottom to consist of craggy rocks,&#10;among which they are whirled to and fro. This stream is regulated by the&#10;flux and reflux of the sea--it being constantly high and low water every&#10;six hours. In the year 1645, early in the morning of Sexagesima Sunday,&#10;it raged with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones of the&#10;houses on the coast fell to the ground.&quot;&#10;&#10;In regard to the depth of the water, I could not see how this could have&#10;been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of the vortex. The&#10;&quot;forty fathoms&quot; must have reference only to portions of the channel&#10;close upon the shore either of Moskoe or Lofoden. The depth in the&#10;centre of the Moskoe-strÃ¶m must be immeasurably greater; and no better&#10;proof of this fact is necessary than can be obtained from even the&#10;sidelong glance into the abyss of the whirl which may be had from the&#10;highest crag of Helseggen. Looking down from this pinnacle upon the&#10;howling Phlegethon below, I could not help smiling at the simplicity&#10;with which the honest Jonas Ramus records, as a matter difficult of&#10;belief, the anecdotes of the whales and the bears; for it appeared to&#10;me, in fact, a self-evident thing, that the largest ship of the line in&#10;existence, coming within the influence of that deadly attraction, could&#10;resist it as little as a feather the hurricane, and must disappear&#10;bodily and at once.&#10;&#10;The attempts to account for the phenomenon--some of which, I remember,&#10;seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusal--now wore a very&#10;different and unsatisfactory aspect. The idea generally received is that&#10;this, as well as three smaller vortices among the Ferroe islands, &quot;have&#10;no other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling, at flux&#10;and reflux, against a ridge of rocks and shelves, which confines the&#10;water so that it precipitates itself like a cataract; and thus the&#10;higher the flood rises, the deeper must the fall be, and the natural&#10;result of all is a whirlpool or vortex, the prodigious suction of which&#10;is sufficiently known by lesser experiments.&quot;--These are the words of&#10;the EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica. Kircher and others imagine that in the&#10;centre of the channel of the MaelstrÃ¶m is an abyss penetrating the&#10;globe, and issuing in some very remote part--the Gulf of Bothnia being&#10;somewhat decidedly named in one instance. This opinion, idle in itself,&#10;was the one to which, as I gazed, my imagination most readily assented;&#10;and, mentioning it to the guide, I was rather surprised to hear him say&#10;that, although it was the view almost universally entertained of the&#10;subject by the Norwegians, it nevertheless was not his own. As to the&#10;former notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it; and here I&#10;agreed with him--for, however conclusive on paper, it becomes altogether&#10;unintelligible, and even absurd, amid the thunder of the abyss.&#10;&#10;&quot;You have had a good look at the whirl now,&quot; said the old man, &quot;and if&#10;you will creep round this crag, so as to get in its lee, and deaden&#10;the roar of the water, I will tell you a story that will convince you I&#10;ought to know something of the Moskoe-strÃ¶m.&quot;&#10;&#10;I placed myself as desired, and he proceeded.&#10;&#10;&quot;Myself and my two brothers once owned a schooner-rigged smack of about&#10;seventy tons burthen, with which we were in the habit of fishing among&#10;the islands beyond Moskoe, nearly to Vurrgh. In all violent eddies at&#10;sea there is good fishing, at proper opportunities, if one has only the&#10;courage to attempt it; but among the whole of the Lofoden coastmen, we&#10;three were the only ones who made a regular business of going out to the&#10;islands, as I tell you. The usual grounds are a great way lower down to&#10;the southward. There fish can be got at all hours, without much risk,&#10;and therefore these places are preferred. The choice spots over here&#10;among the rocks, however, not only yield the finest variety, but in far&#10;greater abundance; so that we often got in a single day, what the more&#10;timid of the craft could not scrape together in a week. In fact, we made&#10;it a matter of desperate speculation--the risk of life standing instead&#10;of labor, and courage answering for capital.&#10;&#10;&quot;We kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast than&#10;this; and it was our practice, in fine weather, to take advantage of&#10;the fifteen minutes' slack to push across the main channel of the&#10;Moskoe-strÃ¶m, far above the pool, and then drop down upon anchorage&#10;somewhere near Otterholm, or Sandflesen, where the eddies are not so&#10;violent as elsewhere. Here we used to remain until nearly time for&#10;slack-water again, when we weighed and made for home. We never set&#10;out upon this expedition without a steady side wind for going and&#10;coming--one that we felt sure would not fail us before our return--and&#10;we seldom made a mis-calculation upon this point. Twice, during six&#10;years, we were forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead&#10;calm, which is a rare thing indeed just about here; and once we had to&#10;remain on the grounds nearly a week, starving to death, owing to a&#10;gale which blew up shortly after our arrival, and made the channel too&#10;boisterous to be thought of. Upon this occasion we should have been&#10;driven out to sea in spite of everything, (for the whirlpools threw us&#10;round and round so violently, that, at length, we fouled our anchor&#10;and dragged it) if it had not been that we drifted into one of the&#10;innumerable cross currents--here to-day and gone to-morrow--which drove&#10;us under the lee of Flimen, where, by good luck, we brought up.&#10;&#10;&quot;I could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we&#10;encountered 'on the grounds'--it is a bad spot to be in, even in&#10;good weather--but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the&#10;Moskoe-strÃ¶m itself without accident; although at times my heart has&#10;been in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind or before&#10;the slack. The wind sometimes was not as strong as we thought it at&#10;starting, and then we made rather less way than we could wish, while&#10;the current rendered the smack unmanageable. My eldest brother had a son&#10;eighteen years old, and I had two stout boys of my own. These would have&#10;been of great assistance at such times, in using the sweeps, as well as&#10;afterward in fishing--but, somehow, although we ran the risk ourselves,&#10;we had not the heart to let the young ones get into the danger--for,&#10;after all is said and done, it _was_ a horrible danger, and that is the&#10;truth.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is now within a few days of three years since what I am going to&#10;tell you occurred. It was on the tenth day of July, 18-, a day which the&#10;people of this part of the world will never forget--for it was one&#10;in which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of&#10;the heavens. And yet all the morning, and indeed until late in the&#10;afternoon, there was a gentle and steady breeze from the south-west,&#10;while the sun shone brightly, so that the oldest seaman among us could&#10;not have foreseen what was to follow.&#10;&#10;&quot;The three of us--my two brothers and myself--had crossed over to the&#10;islands about two o'clock P. M., and had soon nearly loaded the smack&#10;with fine fish, which, we all remarked, were more plenty that day&#10;than we had ever known them. It was just seven, _by my watch_, when we&#10;weighed and started for home, so as to make the worst of the StrÃ¶m at&#10;slack water, which we knew would be at eight.&#10;&#10;&quot;We set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter, and for some&#10;time spanked along at a great rate, never dreaming of danger, for indeed&#10;we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it. All at once we&#10;were taken aback by a breeze from over Helseggen. This was most&#10;unusual--something that had never happened to us before--and I began to&#10;feel a little uneasy, without exactly knowing why. We put the boat on&#10;the wind, but could make no headway at all for the eddies, and I was&#10;upon the point of proposing to return to the anchorage, when, looking&#10;astern, we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular copper-colored&#10;cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity.&#10;&#10;&quot;In the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away, and we&#10;were dead becalmed, drifting about in every direction. This state of&#10;things, however, did not last long enough to give us time to think about&#10;it. In less than a minute the storm was upon us--in less than two the&#10;sky was entirely overcast--and what with this and the driving spray, it&#10;became suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in the smack.&#10;&#10;&quot;Such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing. The&#10;oldest seaman in Norway never experienced any thing like it. We had let&#10;our sails go by the run before it cleverly took us; but, at the first&#10;puff, both our masts went by the board as if they had been sawed&#10;off--the mainmast taking with it my youngest brother, who had lashed&#10;himself to it for safety.&#10;&#10;&quot;Our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon water.&#10;It had a complete flush deck, with only a small hatch near the bow, and&#10;this hatch it had always been our custom to batten down when about to&#10;cross the StrÃ¶m, by way of precaution against the chopping seas. But for&#10;this circumstance we should have foundered at once--for we lay entirely&#10;buried for some moments. How my elder brother escaped destruction I&#10;cannot say, for I never had an opportunity of ascertaining. For my part,&#10;as soon as I had let the foresail run, I threw myself flat on deck,&#10;with my feet against the narrow gunwale of the bow, and with my hands&#10;grasping a ring-bolt near the foot of the fore-mast. It was mere&#10;instinct that prompted me to do this--which was undoubtedly the very&#10;best thing I could have done--for I was too much flurried to think.&#10;&#10;&quot;For some moments we were completely deluged, as I say, and all this&#10;time I held my breath, and clung to the bolt. When I could stand it no&#10;longer I raised myself upon my knees, still keeping hold with my hands,&#10;and thus got my head clear. Presently our little boat gave herself&#10;a shake, just as a dog does in coming out of the water, and thus rid&#10;herself, in some measure, of the seas. I was now trying to get the&#10;better of the stupor that had come over me, and to collect my senses so&#10;as to see what was to be done, when I felt somebody grasp my arm. It was&#10;my elder brother, and my heart leaped for joy, for I had made sure&#10;that he was overboard--but the next moment all this joy was turned into&#10;horror--for he put his mouth close to my ear, and screamed out the word&#10;'_Moskoe-strÃ¶m!_'&#10;&#10;&quot;No one ever will know what my feelings were at that moment. I shook&#10;from head to foot as if I had had the most violent fit of the ague. I&#10;knew what he meant by that one word well enough--I knew what he wished&#10;to make me understand. With the wind that now drove us on, we were bound&#10;for the whirl of the StrÃ¶m, and nothing could save us!&#10;&#10;&quot;You perceive that in crossing the StrÃ¶m _channel_, we always went a&#10;long way up above the whirl, even in the calmest weather, and then had&#10;to wait and watch carefully for the slack--but now we were driving right&#10;upon the pool itself, and in such a hurricane as this! 'To be sure,' I&#10;thought, 'we shall get there just about the slack--there is some little&#10;hope in that'--but in the next moment I cursed myself for being so great&#10;a fool as to dream of hope at all. I knew very well that we were doomed,&#10;had we been ten times a ninety-gun ship.&#10;&#10;&quot;By this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself, or perhaps&#10;we did not feel it so much, as we scudded before it, but at all events&#10;the seas, which at first had been kept down by the wind, and lay flat&#10;and frothing, now got up into absolute mountains. A singular change,&#10;too, had come over the heavens. Around in every direction it was still&#10;as black as pitch, but nearly overhead there burst out, all at once, a&#10;circular rift of clear sky--as clear as I ever saw--and of a deep bright&#10;blue--and through it there blazed forth the full moon with a lustre that&#10;I never before knew her to wear. She lit up every thing about us with&#10;the greatest distinctness--but, oh God, what a scene it was to light up!&#10;&#10;&quot;I now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother--but, in some&#10;manner which I could not understand, the din had so increased that I&#10;could not make him hear a single word, although I screamed at the top&#10;of my voice in his ear. Presently he shook his head, looking as pale as&#10;death, and held up one of his fingers, as if to say _'listen! '_&#10;&#10;&quot;At first I could not make out what he meant--but soon a hideous thought&#10;flashed upon me. I dragged my watch from its fob. It was not going. I&#10;glanced at its face by the moonlight, and then burst into tears as I&#10;flung it far away into the ocean. _It had run down at seven o'clock!&#10;We were behind the time of the slack, and the whirl of the StrÃ¶m was in&#10;full fury!_&#10;&#10;&quot;When a boat is well built, properly trimmed, and not deep laden, the&#10;waves in a strong gale, when she is going large, seem always to slip&#10;from beneath her--which appears very strange to a landsman--and this is&#10;what is called _riding_, in sea phrase. Well, so far we had ridden the&#10;swells very cleverly; but presently a gigantic sea happened to take us&#10;right under the counter, and bore us with it as it rose--up--up--as&#10;if into the sky. I would not have believed that any wave could rise so&#10;high. And then down we came with a sweep, a slide, and a plunge,&#10;that made me feel sick and dizzy, as if I was falling from some lofty&#10;mountain-top in a dream. But while we were up I had thrown a quick&#10;glance around--and that one glance was all sufficient. I saw our exact&#10;position in an instant. The Moskoe-StrÃ¶m whirlpool was about a quarter&#10;of a mile dead ahead--but no more like the every-day Moskoe-StrÃ¶m, than&#10;the whirl as you now see it is like a mill-race. If I had not known&#10;where we were, and what we had to expect, I should not have recognised&#10;the place at all. As it was, I involuntarily closed my eyes in horror.&#10;The lids clenched themselves together as if in a spasm.&#10;&#10;&quot;It could not have been more than two minutes afterward until we&#10;suddenly felt the waves subside, and were enveloped in foam. The&#10;boat made a sharp half turn to larboard, and then shot off in its new&#10;direction like a thunderbolt. At the same moment the roaring noise of&#10;the water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill shriek--such a&#10;sound as you might imagine given out by the waste-pipes of many thousand&#10;steam-vessels, letting off their steam all together. We were now in the&#10;belt of surf that always surrounds the whirl; and I thought, of course,&#10;that another moment would plunge us into the abyss--down which we could&#10;only see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which we&#10;wore borne along. The boat did not seem to sink into the water at&#10;all, but to skim like an air-bubble upon the surface of the surge. Her&#10;starboard side was next the whirl, and on the larboard arose the world&#10;of ocean we had left. It stood like a huge writhing wall between us and&#10;the horizon.&#10;&#10;&quot;It may appear strange, but now, when we were in the very jaws of the&#10;gulf, I felt more composed than when we were only approaching it. Having&#10;made up my mind to hope no more, I got rid of a great deal of that&#10;terror which unmanned me at first. I suppose it was despair that strung&#10;my nerves.&#10;&#10;&quot;It may look like boasting--but what I tell you is truth--I began to&#10;reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a manner, and how&#10;foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration as my own&#10;individual life, in view of so wonderful a manifestation of God's power.&#10;I do believe that I blushed with shame when this idea crossed my mind.&#10;After a little while I became possessed with the keenest curiosity about&#10;the whirl itself. I positively felt a _wish_ to explore its depths, even&#10;at the sacrifice I was going to make; and my principal grief was that&#10;I should never be able to tell my old companions on shore about the&#10;mysteries I should see. These, no doubt, were singular fancies to occupy&#10;a man's mind in such extremity--and I have often thought since, that the&#10;revolutions of the boat around the pool might have rendered me a little&#10;light-headed.&#10;&#10;&quot;There was another circumstance which tended to restore my&#10;self-possession; and this was the cessation of the wind, which could not&#10;reach us in our present situation--for, as you saw yourself, the belt of&#10;surf is considerably lower than the general bed of the ocean, and this&#10;latter now towered above us, a high, black, mountainous ridge. If you&#10;have never been at sea in a heavy gale, you can form no idea of the&#10;confusion of mind occasioned by the wind and spray together. They&#10;blind, deafen, and strangle you, and take away all power of action&#10;or reflection. But we were now, in a great measure, rid of these&#10;annoyances--just as death-condemned felons in prison are allowed petty&#10;indulgences, forbidden them while their doom is yet uncertain.&#10;&#10;&quot;How often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to say.&#10;We careered round and round for perhaps an hour, flying rather than&#10;floating, getting gradually more and more into the middle of the surge,&#10;and then nearer and nearer to its horrible inner edge. All this time I&#10;had never let go of the ring-bolt. My brother was at the stern, holding&#10;on to a small empty water-cask which had been securely lashed under the&#10;coop of the counter, and was the only thing on deck that had not been&#10;swept overboard when the gale first took us. As we approached the brink&#10;of the pit he let go his hold upon this, and made for the ring, from&#10;which, in the agony of his terror, he endeavored to force my hands, as&#10;it was not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp. I never felt&#10;deeper grief than when I saw him attempt this act--although I knew he&#10;was a madman when he did it--a raving maniac through sheer fright. I did&#10;not care, however, to contest the point with him. I knew it could make&#10;no difference whether either of us held on at all; so I let him have the&#10;bolt, and went astern to the cask. This there was no great difficulty&#10;in doing; for the smack flew round steadily enough, and upon an even&#10;keel--only swaying to and fro, with the immense sweeps and swelters of&#10;the whirl. Scarcely had I secured myself in my new position, when we&#10;gave a wild lurch to starboard, and rushed headlong into the abyss. I&#10;muttered a hurried prayer to God, and thought all was over.&#10;&#10;&quot;As I felt the sickening sweep of the descent, I had instinctively&#10;tightened my hold upon the barrel, and closed my eyes. For some seconds&#10;I dared not open them--while I expected instant destruction, and&#10;wondered that I was not already in my death-struggles with the water.&#10;But moment after moment elapsed. I still lived. The sense of falling had&#10;ceased; and the motion of the vessel seemed much as it had been before,&#10;while in the belt of foam, with the exception that she now lay more&#10;along. I took courage, and looked once again upon the scene.&#10;&#10;&quot;Never shall I forget the sensations of awe, horror, and admiration with&#10;which I gazed about me. The boat appeared to be hanging, as if by&#10;magic, midway down, upon the interior surface of a funnel vast in&#10;circumference, prodigious in depth, and whose perfectly smooth sides&#10;might have been mistaken for ebony, but for the bewildering rapidity&#10;with which they spun around, and for the gleaming and ghastly radiance&#10;they shot forth, as the rays of the full moon, from that circular rift&#10;amid the clouds which I have already described, streamed in a flood of&#10;golden glory along the black walls, and far away down into the inmost&#10;recesses of the abyss.&#10;&#10;&quot;At first I was too much confused to observe anything accurately.&#10;The general burst of terrific grandeur was all that I beheld. When I&#10;recovered myself a little, however, my gaze fell instinctively downward.&#10;In this direction I was able to obtain an unobstructed view, from the&#10;manner in which the smack hung on the inclined surface of the pool. She&#10;was quite upon an even keel--that is to say, her deck lay in a plane&#10;parallel with that of the water--but this latter sloped at an angle of&#10;more than forty-five degrees, so that we seemed to be lying upon our&#10;beam-ends. I could not help observing, nevertheless, that I had scarcely&#10;more difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in this situation,&#10;than if we had been upon a dead level; and this, I suppose, was owing to&#10;the speed at which we revolved.&#10;&#10;&quot;The rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the profound&#10;gulf; but still I could make out nothing distinctly, on account of a&#10;thick mist in which everything there was enveloped, and over which there&#10;hung a magnificent rainbow, like that narrow and tottering bridge which&#10;Mussulmen say is the only pathway between Time and Eternity. This mist,&#10;or spray, was no doubt occasioned by the clashing of the great walls of&#10;the funnel, as they all met together at the bottom--but the yell that&#10;went up to the Heavens from out of that mist, I dare not attempt to&#10;describe.&#10;&#10;&quot;Our first slide into the abyss itself, from the belt of foam above, had&#10;carried us a great distance down the slope; but our farther descent&#10;was by no means proportionate. Round and round we swept--not with&#10;any uniform movement--but in dizzying swings and jerks, that sent&#10;us sometimes only a few hundred yards--sometimes nearly the complete&#10;circuit of the whirl. Our progress downward, at each revolution, was&#10;slow, but very perceptible.&#10;&#10;&quot;Looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we were&#10;thus borne, I perceived that our boat was not the only object in the&#10;embrace of the whirl. Both above and below us were visible fragments of&#10;vessels, large masses of building timber and trunks of trees, with&#10;many smaller articles, such as pieces of house furniture, broken boxes,&#10;barrels and staves. I have already described the unnatural curiosity&#10;which had taken the place of my original terrors. It appeared to grow&#10;upon me as I drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom. I now began to&#10;watch, with a strange interest, the numerous things that floated in our&#10;company. I _must_ have been delirious--for I even sought _amusement_&#10;in speculating upon the relative velocities of their several descents&#10;toward the foam below. 'This fir tree,' I found myself at one time&#10;saying, 'will certainly be the next thing that takes the awful plunge&#10;and disappears,'--and then I was disappointed to find that the wreck of&#10;a Dutch merchant ship overtook it and went down before. At length, after&#10;making several guesses of this nature, and being deceived in all--this&#10;fact--the fact of my invariable miscalculation--set me upon a train of&#10;reflection that made my limbs again tremble, and my heart beat heavily&#10;once more.&#10;&#10;&quot;It was not a new terror that thus affected me, but the dawn of a more&#10;exciting _hope_. This hope arose partly from memory, and partly from&#10;present observation. I called to mind the great variety of buoyant&#10;matter that strewed the coast of Lofoden, having been absorbed and&#10;then thrown forth by the Moskoe-strÃ¶m. By far the greater number of the&#10;articles were shattered in the most extraordinary way--so chafed&#10;and roughened as to have the appearance of being stuck full of&#10;splinters--but then I distinctly recollected that there were _some_ of&#10;them which were not disfigured at all. Now I could not account for this&#10;difference except by supposing that the roughened fragments were the&#10;only ones which had been _completely absorbed_--that the others had&#10;entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide, or, for some reason,&#10;had descended so slowly after entering, that they did not reach the&#10;bottom before the turn of the flood came, or of the ebb, as the case&#10;might be. I conceived it possible, in either instance, that they might&#10;thus be whirled up again to the level of the ocean, without undergoing&#10;the fate of those which had been drawn in more early, or absorbed more&#10;rapidly. I made, also, three important observations. The first was,&#10;that, as a general rule, the larger the bodies were, the more rapid&#10;their descent--the second, that, between two masses of equal extent, the&#10;one spherical, and the other _of any other shape_, the superiority&#10;in speed of descent was with the sphere--the third, that, between two&#10;masses of equal size, the one cylindrical, and the other of any other&#10;shape, the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly. Since my escape, I&#10;have had several conversations on this subject with an old school-master&#10;of the district; and it was from him that I learned the use of the words&#10;'cylinder' and 'sphere.' He explained to me--although I have forgotten&#10;the explanation--how what I observed was, in fact, the natural&#10;consequence of the forms of the floating fragments--and showed me how it&#10;happened that a cylinder, swimming in a vortex, offered more resistance&#10;to its suction, and was drawn in with greater difficulty than an equally&#10;bulky body, of any form whatever. (*1)&#10;&#10;&quot;There was one startling circumstance which went a great way in&#10;enforcing these observations, and rendering me anxious to turn them to&#10;account, and this was that, at every revolution, we passed something&#10;like a barrel, or else the yard or the mast of a vessel, while many of&#10;these things, which had been on our level when I first opened my eyes&#10;upon the wonders of the whirlpool, were now high up above us, and seemed&#10;to have moved but little from their original station.&#10;&#10;&quot;I no longer hesitated what to do. I resolved to lash myself securely to&#10;the water cask upon which I now held, to cut it loose from the counter,&#10;and to throw myself with it into the water. I attracted my brother's&#10;attention by signs, pointed to the floating barrels that came near us,&#10;and did everything in my power to make him understand what I was about&#10;to do. I thought at length that he comprehended my design--but, whether&#10;this was the case or not, he shook his head despairingly, and refused to&#10;move from his station by the ring-bolt. It was impossible to reach him;&#10;the emergency admitted of no delay; and so, with a bitter struggle, I&#10;resigned him to his fate, fastened myself to the cask by means of the&#10;lashings which secured it to the counter, and precipitated myself with&#10;it into the sea, without another moment's hesitation.&#10;&#10;&quot;The result was precisely what I had hoped it might be. As it is myself&#10;who now tell you this tale--as you see that I _did_ escape--and as you&#10;are already in possession of the mode in which this escape was effected,&#10;and must therefore anticipate all that I have farther to say--I will&#10;bring my story quickly to conclusion. It might have been an hour, or&#10;thereabout, after my quitting the smack, when, having descended to a&#10;vast distance beneath me, it made three or four wild gyrations in rapid&#10;succession, and, bearing my loved brother with it, plunged headlong, at&#10;once and forever, into the chaos of foam below. The barrel to which I&#10;was attached sunk very little farther than half the distance between the&#10;bottom of the gulf and the spot at which I leaped overboard, before a&#10;great change took place in the character of the whirlpool. The slope of&#10;the sides of the vast funnel became momently less and less steep.&#10;The gyrations of the whirl grew, gradually, less and less violent. By&#10;degrees, the froth and the rainbow disappeared, and the bottom of the&#10;gulf seemed slowly to uprise. The sky was clear, the winds had gone&#10;down, and the full moon was setting radiantly in the west, when I&#10;found myself on the surface of the ocean, in full view of the shores&#10;of Lofoden, and above the spot where the pool of the Moskoe-strÃ¶m&#10;_had been_. It was the hour of the slack--but the sea still heaved&#10;in mountainous waves from the effects of the hurricane. I was borne&#10;violently into the channel of the StrÃ¶m, and in a few minutes was&#10;hurried down the coast into the 'grounds' of the fishermen. A boat&#10;picked me up--exhausted from fatigue--and (now that the danger was&#10;removed) speechless from the memory of its horror. Those who drew me on&#10;board were my old mates and daily companions--but they knew me no more&#10;than they would have known a traveller from the spirit-land. My hair&#10;which had been raven-black the day before, was as white as you see&#10;it now. They say too that the whole expression of my countenance had&#10;changed. I told them my story--they did not believe it. I now tell it&#10;to _you_--and I can scarcely expect you to put more faith in it than did&#10;the merry fishermen of Lofoden.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;VON KEMPELEN AND HIS DISCOVERY&#10;&#10;AFTER THE very minute and elaborate paper by Arago, to say nothing of&#10;the summary in 'Silliman's Journal,' with the detailed statement just&#10;published by Lieutenant Maury, it will not be supposed, of course,&#10;that in offering a few hurried remarks in reference to Von Kempelen's&#10;discovery, I have any design to look at the subject in a scientific&#10;point of view. My object is simply, in the first place, to say a few&#10;words of Von Kempelen himself (with whom, some years ago, I had the&#10;honor of a slight personal acquaintance), since every thing which&#10;concerns him must necessarily, at this moment, be of interest; and, in&#10;the second place, to look in a general way, and speculatively, at the&#10;results of the discovery.&#10;&#10;It may be as well, however, to premise the cursory observations which&#10;I have to offer, by denying, very decidedly, what seems to be a&#10;general impression (gleaned, as usual in a case of this kind, from the&#10;newspapers), viz.: that this discovery, astounding as it unquestionably&#10;is, is unanticipated.&#10;&#10;By reference to the 'Diary of Sir Humphrey Davy' (Cottle and Munroe,&#10;London, pp. 150), it will be seen at pp. 53 and 82, that this&#10;illustrious chemist had not only conceived the idea now in question,&#10;but had actually made no inconsiderable progress, experimentally, in the&#10;very identical analysis now so triumphantly brought to an issue by Von&#10;Kempelen, who although he makes not the slightest allusion to it, is,&#10;without doubt (I say it unhesitatingly, and can prove it, if required),&#10;indebted to the 'Diary' for at least the first hint of his own&#10;undertaking.&#10;&#10;The paragraph from the 'Courier and Enquirer,' which is now going the&#10;rounds of the press, and which purports to claim the invention for a&#10;Mr. Kissam, of Brunswick, Maine, appears to me, I confess, a little&#10;apocryphal, for several reasons; although there is nothing either&#10;impossible or very improbable in the statement made. I need not go into&#10;details. My opinion of the paragraph is founded principally upon its&#10;manner. It does not look true. Persons who are narrating facts, are&#10;seldom so particular as Mr. Kissam seems to be, about day and date and&#10;precise location. Besides, if Mr. Kissam actually did come upon the&#10;discovery he says he did, at the period designated--nearly eight years&#10;ago--how happens it that he took no steps, on the instant, to reap the&#10;immense benefits which the merest bumpkin must have known would have&#10;resulted to him individually, if not to the world at large, from the&#10;discovery? It seems to me quite incredible that any man of common&#10;understanding could have discovered what Mr. Kissam says he did, and yet&#10;have subsequently acted so like a baby--so like an owl--as Mr. Kissam&#10;admits that he did. By-the-way, who is Mr. Kissam? and is not the whole&#10;paragraph in the 'Courier and Enquirer' a fabrication got up to 'make&#10;a talk'? It must be confessed that it has an amazingly moon-hoaxy-air.&#10;Very little dependence is to be placed upon it, in my humble opinion;&#10;and if I were not well aware, from experience, how very easily men of&#10;science are mystified, on points out of their usual range of inquiry,&#10;I should be profoundly astonished at finding so eminent a chemist as&#10;Professor Draper, discussing Mr. Kissam's (or is it Mr. Quizzem's?)&#10;pretensions to the discovery, in so serious a tone.&#10;&#10;But to return to the 'Diary' of Sir Humphrey Davy. This pamphlet was not&#10;designed for the public eye, even upon the decease of the writer, as any&#10;person at all conversant with authorship may satisfy himself at once by&#10;the slightest inspection of the style. At page 13, for example, near the&#10;middle, we read, in reference to his researches about the protoxide&#10;of azote: 'In less than half a minute the respiration being continued,&#10;diminished gradually and were succeeded by analogous to gentle pressure&#10;on all the muscles.' That the respiration was not 'diminished,' is not&#10;only clear by the subsequent context, but by the use of the plural,&#10;'were.' The sentence, no doubt, was thus intended: 'In less than half&#10;a minute, the respiration [being continued, these feelings] diminished&#10;gradually, and were succeeded by [a sensation] analogous to gentle&#10;pressure on all the muscles.' A hundred similar instances go to show&#10;that the MS. so inconsiderately published, was merely a rough note-book,&#10;meant only for the writer's own eye, but an inspection of the pamphlet&#10;will convince almost any thinking person of the truth of my suggestion.&#10;The fact is, Sir Humphrey Davy was about the last man in the world&#10;to commit himself on scientific topics. Not only had he a more than&#10;ordinary dislike to quackery, but he was morbidly afraid of appearing&#10;empirical; so that, however fully he might have been convinced that he&#10;was on the right track in the matter now in question, he would never&#10;have spoken out, until he had every thing ready for the most practical&#10;demonstration. I verily believe that his last moments would have been&#10;rendered wretched, could he have suspected that his wishes in regard&#10;to burning this 'Diary' (full of crude speculations) would have been&#10;unattended to; as, it seems, they were. I say 'his wishes,' for that he&#10;meant to include this note-book among the miscellaneous papers directed&#10;'to be burnt,' I think there can be no manner of doubt. Whether it&#10;escaped the flames by good fortune or by bad, yet remains to be seen.&#10;That the passages quoted above, with the other similar ones referred to,&#10;gave Von Kempelen the hint, I do not in the slightest degree question;&#10;but I repeat, it yet remains to be seen whether this momentous discovery&#10;itself (momentous under any circumstances) will be of service or&#10;disservice to mankind at large. That Von Kempelen and his immediate&#10;friends will reap a rich harvest, it would be folly to doubt for a&#10;moment. They will scarcely be so weak as not to 'realize,' in time, by&#10;large purchases of houses and land, with other property of intrinsic&#10;value.&#10;&#10;In the brief account of Von Kempelen which appeared in the&#10;'Home Journal,' and has since been extensively copied, several&#10;misapprehensions of the German original seem to have been made by the&#10;translator, who professes to have taken the passage from a late number&#10;of the Presburg 'Schnellpost.' 'Viele' has evidently been misconceived&#10;(as it often is), and what the translator renders by 'sorrows,' is&#10;probably 'lieden,' which, in its true version, 'sufferings,' would give&#10;a totally different complexion to the whole account; but, of course,&#10;much of this is merely guess, on my part.&#10;&#10;Von Kempelen, however, is by no means 'a misanthrope,' in appearance, at&#10;least, whatever he may be in fact. My acquaintance with him was casual&#10;altogether; and I am scarcely warranted in saying that I know him&#10;at all; but to have seen and conversed with a man of so prodigious a&#10;notoriety as he has attained, or will attain in a few days, is not a&#10;small matter, as times go.&#10;&#10;'The Literary World' speaks of him, confidently, as a native of Presburg&#10;(misled, perhaps, by the account in 'The Home Journal') but I am pleased&#10;in being able to state positively, since I have it from his own lips,&#10;that he was born in Utica, in the State of New York, although both his&#10;parents, I believe, are of Presburg descent. The family is connected, in&#10;some way, with Maelzel, of Automaton-chess-player memory. In person, he&#10;is short and stout, with large, fat, blue eyes, sandy hair and whiskers,&#10;a wide but pleasing mouth, fine teeth, and I think a Roman nose. There&#10;is some defect in one of his feet. His address is frank, and his whole&#10;manner noticeable for bonhomie. Altogether, he looks, speaks, and&#10;acts as little like 'a misanthrope' as any man I ever saw. We were&#10;fellow-sojourners for a week about six years ago, at Earl's Hotel, in&#10;Providence, Rhode Island; and I presume that I conversed with him, at&#10;various times, for some three or four hours altogether. His principal&#10;topics were those of the day, and nothing that fell from him led me&#10;to suspect his scientific attainments. He left the hotel before me,&#10;intending to go to New York, and thence to Bremen; it was in the latter&#10;city that his great discovery was first made public; or, rather, it was&#10;there that he was first suspected of having made it. This is about all&#10;that I personally know of the now immortal Von Kempelen; but I have&#10;thought that even these few details would have interest for the public.&#10;&#10;There can be little question that most of the marvellous rumors afloat&#10;about this affair are pure inventions, entitled to about as much credit&#10;as the story of Aladdin's lamp; and yet, in a case of this kind, as in&#10;the case of the discoveries in California, it is clear that the truth&#10;may be stranger than fiction. The following anecdote, at least, is so&#10;well authenticated, that we may receive it implicitly.&#10;&#10;Von Kempelen had never been even tolerably well off during his residence&#10;at Bremen; and often, it was well known, he had been put to extreme&#10;shifts in order to raise trifling sums. When the great excitement&#10;occurred about the forgery on the house of Gutsmuth &amp; Co., suspicion&#10;was directed toward Von Kempelen, on account of his having purchased&#10;a considerable property in Gasperitch Lane, and his refusing, when&#10;questioned, to explain how he became possessed of the purchase money. He&#10;was at length arrested, but nothing decisive appearing against him, was&#10;in the end set at liberty. The police, however, kept a strict watch upon&#10;his movements, and thus discovered that he left home frequently, taking&#10;always the same road, and invariably giving his watchers the slip in the&#10;neighborhood of that labyrinth of narrow and crooked passages known&#10;by the flash name of the 'Dondergat.' Finally, by dint of great&#10;perseverance, they traced him to a garret in an old house of seven&#10;stories, in an alley called Flatzplatz,--and, coming upon him suddenly,&#10;found him, as they imagined, in the midst of his counterfeiting&#10;operations. His agitation is represented as so excessive that the&#10;officers had not the slightest doubt of his guilt. After hand-cuffing&#10;him, they searched his room, or rather rooms, for it appears he occupied&#10;all the mansarde.&#10;&#10;Opening into the garret where they caught him, was a closet, ten feet by&#10;eight, fitted up with some chemical apparatus, of which the object has&#10;not yet been ascertained. In one corner of the closet was a very small&#10;furnace, with a glowing fire in it, and on the fire a kind of duplicate&#10;crucible--two crucibles connected by a tube. One of these crucibles was&#10;nearly full of lead in a state of fusion, but not reaching up to the&#10;aperture of the tube, which was close to the brim. The other crucible&#10;had some liquid in it, which, as the officers entered, seemed to be&#10;furiously dissipating in vapor. They relate that, on finding himself&#10;taken, Kempelen seized the crucibles with both hands (which were encased&#10;in gloves that afterwards turned out to be asbestic), and threw the&#10;contents on the tiled floor. It was now that they hand-cuffed him; and&#10;before proceeding to ransack the premises they searched his person, but&#10;nothing unusual was found about him, excepting a paper parcel, in his&#10;coat-pocket, containing what was afterward ascertained to be a mixture&#10;of antimony and some unknown substance, in nearly, but not quite, equal&#10;proportions. All attempts at analyzing the unknown substance have,&#10;so far, failed, but that it will ultimately be analyzed, is not to be&#10;doubted.&#10;&#10;Passing out of the closet with their prisoner, the officers went through&#10;a sort of ante-chamber, in which nothing material was found, to the&#10;chemist's sleeping-room. They here rummaged some drawers and boxes,&#10;but discovered only a few papers, of no importance, and some good coin,&#10;silver and gold. At length, looking under the bed, they saw a large,&#10;common hair trunk, without hinges, hasp, or lock, and with the top lying&#10;carelessly across the bottom portion. Upon attempting to draw this trunk&#10;out from under the bed, they found that, with their united strength&#10;(there were three of them, all powerful men), they 'could not stir it&#10;one inch.' Much astonished at this, one of them crawled under the bed,&#10;and looking into the trunk, said:&#10;&#10;'No wonder we couldn't move it--why it's full to the brim of old bits of&#10;brass!'&#10;&#10;Putting his feet, now, against the wall so as to get a good purchase,&#10;and pushing with all his force, while his companions pulled with all&#10;theirs, the trunk, with much difficulty, was slid out from under the&#10;bed, and its contents examined. The supposed brass with which it was&#10;filled was all in small, smooth pieces, varying from the size of a pea&#10;to that of a dollar; but the pieces were irregular in shape, although&#10;more or less flat-looking, upon the whole, 'very much as lead looks when&#10;thrown upon the ground in a molten state, and there suffered to grow&#10;cool.' Now, not one of these officers for a moment suspected this metal&#10;to be any thing but brass. The idea of its being gold never entered&#10;their brains, of course; how could such a wild fancy have entered it?&#10;And their astonishment may be well conceived, when the next day it&#10;became known, all over Bremen, that the 'lot of brass' which they&#10;had carted so contemptuously to the police office, without putting&#10;themselves to the trouble of pocketing the smallest scrap, was not only&#10;gold--real gold--but gold far finer than any employed in coinage-gold,&#10;in fact, absolutely pure, virgin, without the slightest appreciable&#10;alloy.&#10;&#10;I need not go over the details of Von Kempelen's confession (as far as&#10;it went) and release, for these are familiar to the public. That he has&#10;actually realized, in spirit and in effect, if not to the letter, the&#10;old chimaera of the philosopher's stone, no sane person is at liberty&#10;to doubt. The opinions of Arago are, of course, entitled to the greatest&#10;consideration; but he is by no means infallible; and what he says of&#10;bismuth, in his report to the Academy, must be taken cum grano salis.&#10;The simple truth is, that up to this period all analysis has failed; and&#10;until Von Kempelen chooses to let us have the key to his own published&#10;enigma, it is more than probable that the matter will remain, for years,&#10;in statu quo. All that as yet can fairly be said to be known is, that&#10;'Pure gold can be made at will, and very readily from lead in connection&#10;with certain other substances, in kind and in proportions, unknown.'&#10;&#10;Speculation, of course, is busy as to the immediate and ultimate results&#10;of this discovery--a discovery which few thinking persons will hesitate&#10;in referring to an increased interest in the matter of gold generally,&#10;by the late developments in California; and this reflection brings us&#10;inevitably to another--the exceeding inopportuneness of Von Kempelen's&#10;analysis. If many were prevented from adventuring to California, by the&#10;mere apprehension that gold would so materially diminish in value,&#10;on account of its plentifulness in the mines there, as to render&#10;the speculation of going so far in search of it a doubtful one--what&#10;impression will be wrought now, upon the minds of those about to&#10;emigrate, and especially upon the minds of those actually in the&#10;mineral region, by the announcement of this astounding discovery of Von&#10;Kempelen? a discovery which declares, in so many words, that beyond its&#10;intrinsic worth for manufacturing purposes (whatever that worth may be),&#10;gold now is, or at least soon will be (for it cannot be supposed that&#10;Von Kempelen can long retain his secret), of no greater value than&#10;lead, and of far inferior value to silver. It is, indeed, exceedingly&#10;difficult to speculate prospectively upon the consequences of the&#10;discovery, but one thing may be positively maintained--that the&#10;announcement of the discovery six months ago would have had material&#10;influence in regard to the settlement of California.&#10;&#10;In Europe, as yet, the most noticeable results have been a rise of two&#10;hundred per cent. in the price of lead, and nearly twenty-five per cent.&#10;that of silver.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;MESMERIC REVELATION&#10;&#10; WHATEVER doubt may still envelop the _rationale_ of mesmerism,&#10;its startling _facts_ are now almost universally admitted. Of these&#10;latter, those who doubt, are your mere doubters by profession--an&#10;unprofitable and disreputable tribe. There can be no more absolute waste&#10;of time than the attempt to _prove_, at the present day, that man, by&#10;mere exercise of will, can so impress his fellow, as to cast him into an&#10;abnormal condition, of which the phenomena resemble very closely those&#10;of _death_, or at least resemble them more nearly than they do the&#10;phenomena of any other normal condition within our cognizance; that,&#10;while in this state, the person so impressed employs only with effort,&#10;and then feebly, the external organs of sense, yet perceives, with&#10;keenly refined perception, and through channels supposed unknown,&#10;matters beyond the scope of the physical organs; that, moreover, his&#10;intellectual faculties are wonderfully exalted and invigorated; that his&#10;sympathies with the person so impressing him are profound; and, finally,&#10;that his susceptibility to the impression increases with its frequency,&#10;while, in the same proportion, the peculiar phenomena elicited are more&#10;extended and more _pronounced_.&#10;&#10; I say that these--which are the laws of mesmerism in its&#10;general features--it would be supererogation to demonstrate; nor shall I&#10;inflict upon my readers so needless a demonstration; to-day. My purpose&#10;at present is a very different one indeed. I am impelled, even in&#10;the teeth of a world of prejudice, to detail without comment the very&#10;remarkable substance of a colloquy, occurring between a sleep-waker and&#10;myself.&#10;&#10; I had been long in the habit of mesmerizing the person in&#10;question, (Mr. Vankirk,) and the usual acute susceptibility and&#10;exaltation of the mesmeric perception had supervened. For many months he&#10;had been laboring under confirmed phthisis, the more distressing effects&#10;of which had been relieved by my manipulations; and on the night of&#10;Wednesday, the fifteenth instant, I was summoned to his bedside.&#10;&#10; The invalid was suffering with acute pain in the region of the&#10;heart, and breathed with great difficulty, having all the ordinary&#10;symptoms of asthma. In spasms such as these he had usually found relief&#10;from the application of mustard to the nervous centres, but to-night&#10;this had been attempted in vain.&#10;&#10; As I entered his room he greeted me with a cheerful smile, and&#10;although evidently in much bodily pain, appeared to be, mentally, quite&#10;at ease.&#10;&#10; &quot;I sent for you to-night,&quot; he said, &quot;not so much to administer&#10;to my bodily ailment, as to satisfy me concerning certain psychal&#10;impressions which, of late, have occasioned me much anxiety and&#10;surprise. I need not tell you how sceptical I have hitherto been on the&#10;topic of the soul's immortality. I cannot deny that there has always&#10;existed, as if in that very soul which I have been denying, a vague&#10;half-sentiment of its own existence. But this half-sentiment at no&#10;time amounted to conviction. With it my reason had nothing to do.&#10;All attempts at logical inquiry resulted, indeed, in leaving me more&#10;sceptical than before. I had been advised to study Cousin. I studied&#10;him in his own works as well as in those of his European and American&#10;echoes. The 'Charles Elwood' of Mr. Brownson, for example, was placed&#10;in my hands. I read it with profound attention. Throughout I found it&#10;logical, but the portions which were not _merely_ logical were unhappily&#10;the initial arguments of the disbelieving hero of the book. In his&#10;summing up it seemed evident to me that the reasoner had not even&#10;succeeded in convincing himself. His end had plainly forgotten his&#10;beginning, like the government of Trinculo. In short, I was not long in&#10;perceiving that if man is to be intellectually convinced of his own&#10;immortality, he will never be so convinced by the mere abstractions&#10;which have been so long the fashion of the moralists of England, of&#10;France, and of Germany. Abstractions may amuse and exercise, but take no&#10;hold on the mind. Here upon earth, at least, philosophy, I am persuaded,&#10;will always in vain call upon us to look upon qualities as things. The&#10;will may assent--the soul--the intellect, never.&#10;&#10; &quot;I repeat, then, that I only half felt, and never intellectually&#10;believed. But latterly there has been a certain deepening of the&#10;feeling, until it has come so nearly to resemble the acquiescence of&#10;reason, that I find it difficult to distinguish between the two. I am&#10;enabled, too, plainly to trace this effect to the mesmeric influence.&#10;I cannot better explain my meaning than by the hypothesis that the&#10;mesmeric exaltation enables me to perceive a train of ratiocination&#10;which, in my abnormal existence, convinces, but which, in full&#10;accordance with the mesmeric phenomena, does not extend, except through&#10;its _effect_, into my normal condition. In sleep-waking, the reasoning&#10;and its conclusion--the cause and its effect--are present together. In&#10;my natural state, the cause vanishing, the effect only, and perhaps only&#10;partially, remains.&#10;&#10; &quot;These considerations have led me to think that some good&#10;results might ensue from a series of well-directed questions&#10;propounded to me while mesmerized. You have often observed the profound&#10;self-cognizance evinced by the sleep-waker--the extensive knowledge he&#10;displays upon all points relating to the mesmeric condition itself; and&#10;from this self-cognizance may be deduced hints for the proper conduct of&#10;a catechism.&quot;&#10;&#10; I consented of course to make this experiment.  A few passes&#10;threw Mr. Vankirk into the mesmeric sleep. His breathing became&#10;immediately more easy, and he seemed to suffer no physical uneasiness.&#10;The following conversation then ensued:--V. in the dialogue representing&#10;the patient, and P. myself.&#10;&#10;_ P._ Are you asleep?&#10;&#10;_ V._ Yes--no I would rather sleep more soundly.&#10;&#10;_P._ [_After a few more passes._] Do you sleep now?&#10;&#10;_V._ Yes.&#10;&#10;_P._ How do you think your present illness will result?&#10;&#10;_V._ [_After a long hesitation and speaking as if with effort_.] I must&#10;die.&#10;&#10;_P._ Does the idea of death afflict you?&#10;&#10;_V._ [_Very quickly_.] No--no!&#10;&#10;_P._ Are you pleased with the prospect?&#10;&#10;_V._ If I were awake I should like to die, but now it is no matter. The&#10;mesmeric condition is so near death as to content me.&#10;&#10;_P._ I wish you would explain yourself, Mr. Vankirk.&#10;&#10;_V._ I am willing to do so, but it requires more effort than I feel able&#10;to make. You do not question me properly.&#10;&#10;_P._ What then shall I ask?&#10;&#10;_V._ You must begin at the beginning.&#10;&#10;_P._ The beginning! but where is the beginning?&#10;&#10;_V._ You know that the beginning is GOD. [_This was said in a low,&#10;fluctuating tone, and with every sign of the most profound veneration_.]&#10;&#10;_P._ What then is God?&#10;&#10;_V._ [_Hesitating for many minutes._] I cannot tell.&#10;&#10;_P._ Is not God spirit?&#10;&#10;_V._ While I was awake I knew what you meant by &quot;spirit,&quot; but now it&#10;seems only a word--such for instance as truth, beauty--a quality, I&#10;mean.&#10;&#10;_P._ Is not God immaterial?&#10;&#10;_V._ There is no immateriality--it is a mere word. That which is not&#10;matter, is not at all--unless qualities are things.&#10;&#10;_P._ Is God, then, material?&#10;&#10;_V._ No. [_This reply startled me very much._]&#10;&#10;_P._ What then is he?&#10;&#10;_V._ [_After a long pause, and mutteringly._] I see--but it is a thing&#10;difficult to tell. [_Another long pause._] He is not spirit, for&#10;he exists. Nor is he matter, as _you understand it_. But there are&#10;_gradations_ of matter of which man knows nothing; the grosser impelling&#10;the finer, the finer pervading the grosser. The atmosphere, for example,&#10;impels the electric principle, while the electric principle permeates&#10;the atmosphere. These gradations of matter increase in rarity&#10;or fineness, until we arrive at a matter _unparticled_--without&#10;particles--indivisible--_one_ and here the law of impulsion and&#10;permeation is modified. The ultimate, or unparticled matter, not only&#10;permeates all things but impels all things--and thus _is_ all things&#10;within itself. This matter is God. What men attempt to embody in the&#10;word &quot;thought,&quot; is this matter in motion.&#10;&#10;_P._ The metaphysicians maintain that all action is reducible to motion&#10;and thinking, and that the latter is the origin of the former.&#10;&#10;_V._ Yes; and I now see the confusion of idea. Motion is the action&#10;of _mind_--not of _thinking_. The unparticled matter, or God, in&#10;quiescence, is (as nearly as we can conceive it) what men call mind. And&#10;the power of self-movement (equivalent in effect to human volition) is,&#10;in the unparticled matter, the result of its unity and omniprevalence;&#10;_how_ I know not, and now clearly see that I shall never know. But the&#10;unparticled matter, set in motion by a law, or quality, existing within&#10;itself, is thinking.&#10;&#10;_P._ Can you give me no more precise idea of what you term the&#10;unparticled matter?&#10;&#10;_V._ The matters of which man is cognizant, escape the senses in&#10;gradation. We have, for example, a metal, a piece of wood, a drop of&#10;water, the atmosphere, a gas, caloric, electricity, the luminiferous&#10;ether. Now we call all these things matter, and embrace all matter in&#10;one general definition; but in spite of this, there can be no two ideas&#10;more essentially distinct than that which we attach to a metal, and that&#10;which we attach to the luminiferous ether. When we reach the latter, we&#10;feel an almost irresistible inclination to class it with spirit, or with&#10;nihility. The only consideration which restrains us is our conception&#10;of its atomic constitution; and here, even, we have to seek aid from&#10;our notion of an atom, as something possessing in infinite minuteness,&#10;solidity, palpability, weight. Destroy the idea of the atomic&#10;constitution and we should no longer be able to regard the ether as an&#10;entity, or at least as matter. For want of a better word we might term&#10;it spirit. Take, now, a step beyond the luminiferous ether--conceive a&#10;matter as much more rare than the ether, as this ether is more rare than&#10;the metal, and we arrive at once (in spite of all the school dogmas) at&#10;a unique mass--an unparticled matter. For although we may admit infinite&#10;littleness in the atoms themselves, the infinitude of littleness in the&#10;spaces between them is an absurdity. There will be a point--there will&#10;be a degree of rarity, at which, if the atoms are sufficiently numerous,&#10;the interspaces must vanish, and the mass absolutely coalesce. But&#10;the consideration of the atomic constitution being now taken away, the&#10;nature of the mass inevitably glides into what we conceive of spirit. It&#10;is clear, however, that it is as fully matter as before. The truth is,&#10;it is impossible to conceive spirit, since it is impossible to&#10;imagine what is not. When we flatter ourselves that we have formed&#10;its conception, we have merely deceived our understanding by the&#10;consideration of infinitely rarified matter.&#10;&#10;_P._ There seems to me an insurmountable objection to the idea&#10;of absolute coalescence;--and that is the very slight resistance&#10;experienced by the heavenly bodies in their revolutions through space--a&#10;resistance now ascertained, it is true, to exist in _some_ degree, but&#10;which is, nevertheless, so slight as to have been quite overlooked by&#10;the sagacity even of Newton. We know that the resistance of bodies&#10;is, chiefly, in proportion to their density. Absolute coalescence&#10;is absolute density. Where there are no interspaces, there can be no&#10;yielding. An ether, absolutely dense, would put an infinitely more&#10;effectual stop to the progress of a star than would an ether of adamant&#10;or of iron.&#10;&#10;_V._ Your objection is answered with an ease which is nearly in the&#10;ratio of its apparent unanswerability.--As regards the progress of the&#10;star, it can make no difference whether the star passes through the&#10;ether _or the ether through it_. There is no astronomical error more&#10;unaccountable than that which reconciles the known retardation of the&#10;comets with the idea of their passage through an ether: for, however&#10;rare this ether be supposed, it would put a stop to all sidereal&#10;revolution in a very far briefer period than has been admitted by those&#10;astronomers who have endeavored to slur over a point which they found&#10;it impossible to comprehend. The retardation actually experienced is, on&#10;the other hand, about that which might be expected from the _friction_&#10;of the ether in the instantaneous passage through the orb. In the one&#10;case, the retarding force is momentary and complete within itself--in&#10;the other it is endlessly accumulative.&#10;&#10;_P._ But in all this--in this identification of mere matter with God--is&#10;there nothing of irreverence? [_I was forced to repeat this question&#10;before the sleep-waker fully comprehended my meaning_.]&#10;&#10;_V._ Can you say _why_ matter should be less reverenced than mind? But&#10;you forget that the matter of which I speak is, in all respects, the&#10;very &quot;mind&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot; of the schools, so far as regards its high&#10;capacities, and is, moreover, the &quot;matter&quot; of these schools at the&#10;same time. God, with all the powers attributed to spirit, is but the&#10;perfection of matter.&#10;&#10;_P._ You assert, then, that the unparticled matter, in motion, is&#10;thought?&#10;&#10;_V._ In general, this motion is the universal thought of the universal&#10;mind. This thought creates. All created things are but the thoughts of&#10;God.&#10;&#10;_P._ You say, &quot;in general.&quot;&#10;&#10;_V._ Yes. The universal mind is God. For new individualities, _matter_&#10;is necessary.&#10;&#10;_P._ But you now speak of &quot;mind&quot; and &quot;matter&quot; as do the metaphysicians.&#10;&#10;_V._ Yes--to avoid confusion. When I say &quot;mind,&quot; I mean the unparticled&#10;or ultimate matter; by &quot;matter,&quot; I intend all else.&#10;&#10;_P._ You were saying that &quot;for new individualities matter is necessary.&quot;&#10;&#10;_V._ Yes; for mind, existing unincorporate, is merely God. To create&#10;individual, thinking beings, it was necessary to incarnate portions&#10;of the divine mind. Thus man is individualized. Divested of corporate&#10;investiture, he were God. Now, the particular motion of the incarnated&#10;portions of the unparticled matter is the thought of man; as the motion&#10;of the whole is that of God.&#10;&#10;_P._ You say that divested of the body man will be God?&#10;&#10;_V._ [_After much hesitation._] I could not have said this; it is an&#10;absurdity.&#10;&#10;_P._ [_Referring to my notes._] You _did_ say that &quot;divested of&#10;corporate investiture man were God.&quot;&#10;&#10;_V._ And this is true. Man thus divested _would be_ God--would be&#10;unindividualized. But he can never be thus divested--at least never&#10;_will be_--else we must imagine an action of God returning upon&#10;itself--a purposeless and futile action. Man is a creature. Creatures&#10;are thoughts of God. It is the nature of thought to be irrevocable.&#10;&#10;_P._ I do not comprehend. You say that man will never put off the body?&#10;&#10;_V._ I say that he will never be bodiless.&#10;&#10;_P._ Explain.&#10;&#10;_V._ There are two bodies--the rudimental and the complete;&#10;corresponding with the two conditions of the worm and the butterfly.&#10;What we call &quot;death,&quot; is but the painful metamorphosis. Our present&#10;incarnation is progressive, preparatory, temporary. Our future is&#10;perfected, ultimate, immortal. The ultimate life is the full design.&#10;&#10;_P._ But of the worm's metamorphosis we are palpably cognizant.&#10;&#10;_V._ _We_, certainly--but not the worm. The matter of which our&#10;rudimental body is composed, is within the ken of the organs of that&#10;body; or, more distinctly, our rudimental organs are adapted to the&#10;matter of which is formed the rudimental body; but not to that of which&#10;the ultimate is composed. The ultimate body thus escapes our rudimental&#10;senses, and we perceive only the shell which falls, in decaying, from&#10;the inner form; not that inner form itself; but this inner form, as&#10;well as the shell, is appreciable by those who have already acquired the&#10;ultimate life.&#10;&#10;_P._ You have often said that the mesmeric state very nearly resembles&#10;death. How is this?&#10;&#10;_V._ When I say that it resembles death, I mean that it resembles the&#10;ultimate life; for when I am entranced the senses of my rudimental&#10;life are in abeyance, and I perceive external things directly,&#10;without organs, through a medium which I shall employ in the ultimate,&#10;unorganized life.&#10;&#10;_P._ Unorganized?&#10;&#10;_V._ Yes; organs are contrivances by which the individual is brought&#10;into sensible relation with particular classes and forms of matter, to&#10;the exclusion of other classes and forms. The organs of man are adapted&#10;to his rudimental condition, and to that only; his ultimate condition,&#10;being unorganized, is of unlimited comprehension in all points but&#10;one--the nature of the volition of God--that is to say, the motion of&#10;the unparticled matter. You will have a distinct idea of the ultimate&#10;body by conceiving it to be entire brain. This it is _not_; but a&#10;conception of this nature will bring you near a comprehension of what it&#10;_is_. A luminous body imparts vibration to the luminiferous ether.&#10;The vibrations generate similar ones within the retina; these again&#10;communicate similar ones to the optic nerve. The nerve conveys similar&#10;ones to the brain; the brain, also, similar ones to the unparticled&#10;matter which permeates it. The motion of this latter is thought, of&#10;which perception is the first undulation. This is the mode by which the&#10;mind of the rudimental life communicates with the external world; and&#10;this external world is, to the rudimental life, limited, through the&#10;idiosyncrasy of its organs. But in the ultimate, unorganized life, the&#10;external world reaches the whole body, (which is of a substance having&#10;affinity to brain, as I have said,) with no other intervention than that&#10;of an infinitely rarer ether than even the luminiferous; and to this&#10;ether--in unison with it--the whole body vibrates, setting in motion&#10;the unparticled matter which permeates it. It is to the absence of&#10;idiosyncratic organs, therefore, that we must attribute the nearly&#10;unlimited perception of the ultimate life. To rudimental beings, organs&#10;are the cages necessary to confine them until fledged.&#10;&#10;_P._ You speak of rudimental &quot;beings.&quot; Are there other rudimental&#10;thinking beings than man?&#10;&#10;_V._ The multitudinous conglomeration of rare matter into nebulÃ¦,&#10;planets, suns, and other bodies which are neither nebulÃ¦, suns,&#10;nor planets, is for the sole purpose of supplying _pabulum_ for the&#10;idiosyncrasy of the organs of an infinity of rudimental beings. But for&#10;the necessity of the rudimental, prior to the ultimate life, there&#10;would have been no bodies such as these. Each of these is tenanted by a&#10;distinct variety of organic, rudimental, thinking creatures. In all,&#10;the organs vary with the features of the place tenanted. At death,&#10;or metamorphosis, these creatures, enjoying the ultimate&#10;life--immortality--and cognizant of all secrets but _the one_, act all&#10;things and pass everywhere by mere volition:--indwelling, not the stars,&#10;which to us seem the sole palpabilities, and for the accommodation&#10;of which we blindly deem space created--but that SPACE itself--that&#10;infinity of which the truly substantive vastness swallows up the&#10;star-shadows--blotting them out as non-entities from the perception of&#10;the angels.&#10;&#10;_P._ You say that &quot;but for the _necessity_ of the rudimental life&quot; there&#10;would have been no stars. But why this necessity?&#10;&#10;_V._ In the inorganic life, as well as in the inorganic matter&#10;generally, there is nothing to impede the action of one simple _unique_&#10;law--the Divine Volition. With the view of producing impediment, the&#10;organic life and matter, (complex, substantial, and law-encumbered,)&#10;were contrived.&#10;&#10;_P._ But again--why need this impediment have been produced?&#10;&#10;_V._ The result of law inviolate is perfection--right--negative&#10;happiness. The result of law violate is imperfection, wrong, positive&#10;pain. Through the impediments afforded by the number, complexity, and&#10;substantiality of the laws of organic life and matter, the violation of&#10;law is rendered, to a certain extent, practicable. Thus pain, which in&#10;the inorganic life is impossible, is possible in the organic.&#10;&#10;_P._ But to what good end is pain thus rendered possible?&#10;&#10;_V._ All things are either good or bad by comparison. A sufficient&#10;analysis will show that pleasure, in all cases, is but the contrast of&#10;pain. _Positive_ pleasure is a mere idea. To be happy at any one point&#10;we must have suffered at the same. Never to suffer would have been never&#10;to have been blessed. But it has been shown that, in the inorganic&#10;life, pain cannot be thus the necessity for the organic. The pain of the&#10;primitive life of Earth, is the sole basis of the bliss of the ultimate&#10;life in Heaven.&#10;&#10;_P._ Still, there is one of your expressions which I find it impossible&#10;to comprehend--&quot;the truly _substantive_ vastness of infinity.&quot;&#10;&#10;_V._ This, probably, is because you have no sufficiently generic&#10;conception of the term &quot;_substance_&quot; itself. We must not regard it as a&#10;quality, but as a sentiment:--it is the perception, in thinking beings,&#10;of the adaptation of matter to their organization. There are many things&#10;on the Earth, which would be nihility to the inhabitants of Venus--many&#10;things visible and tangible in Venus, which we could not be brought&#10;to appreciate as existing at all. But to the inorganic beings--to the&#10;angels--the whole of the unparticled matter is substance--that is&#10;to say, the whole of what we term &quot;space&quot; is to them the truest&#10;substantiality;--the stars, meantime, through what we consider their&#10;materiality, escaping the angelic sense, just in proportion as the&#10;unparticled matter, through what we consider its immateriality, eludes&#10;the organic.&#10;&#10;  As the sleep-waker pronounced these latter words, in a feeble tone,&#10;I observed on his countenance a singular expression, which somewhat&#10;alarmed me, and induced me to awake him at once. No sooner had I done&#10;this, than, with a bright smile irradiating all his features, he fell&#10;back upon his pillow and expired. I noticed that in less than a minute&#10;afterward his corpse had all the stern rigidity of stone. His brow was&#10;of the coldness of ice. Thus, ordinarily, should it have appeared, only&#10;after long pressure from Azrael's hand. Had the sleep-waker, indeed,&#10;during the latter portion of his discourse, been addressing me from out&#10;the region of the shadows?&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;THE FACTS IN THE CASE OF M. VALDEMAR&#10;&#10;OF course I shall not pretend to consider it any matter for wonder, that&#10;the extraordinary case of M. Valdemar has excited discussion. It would&#10;have been a miracle had it not-especially under the circumstances.&#10;Through the desire of all parties concerned, to keep the affair from the&#10;public, at least for the present, or until we had farther opportunities&#10;for investigation--through our endeavors to effect this--a garbled or&#10;exaggerated account made its way into society, and became the source of&#10;many unpleasant misrepresentations, and, very naturally, of a great deal&#10;of disbelief.&#10;&#10;It is now rendered necessary that I give the facts--as far as I&#10;comprehend them myself. They are, succinctly, these:&#10;&#10;My attention, for the last three years, had been repeatedly drawn to&#10;the subject of Mesmerism; and, about nine months ago it occurred to me,&#10;quite suddenly, that in the series of experiments made hitherto, there&#10;had been a very remarkable and most unaccountable omission:--no person&#10;had as yet been mesmerized in articulo mortis. It remained to be seen,&#10;first, whether, in such condition, there existed in the patient any&#10;susceptibility to the magnetic influence; secondly, whether, if any&#10;existed, it was impaired or increased by the condition; thirdly, to what&#10;extent, or for how long a period, the encroachments of Death might be&#10;arrested by the process. There were other points to be ascertained,&#10;but these most excited my curiosity--the last in especial, from the&#10;immensely important character of its consequences.&#10;&#10;In looking around me for some subject by whose means I might test these&#10;particulars, I was brought to think of my friend, M. Ernest Valdemar,&#10;the well-known compiler of the &quot;Bibliotheca Forensica,&quot; and author&#10;(under the nom de plume of Issachar Marx) of the Polish versions of&#10;&quot;Wallenstein&quot; and &quot;Gargantua.&quot; M. Valdemar, who has resided principally&#10;at Harlaem, N.Y., since the year 1839, is (or was) particularly&#10;noticeable for the extreme spareness of his person--his lower limbs much&#10;resembling those of John Randolph; and, also, for the whiteness of his&#10;whiskers, in violent contrast to the blackness of his hair--the latter,&#10;in consequence, being very generally mistaken for a wig. His temperament&#10;was markedly nervous, and rendered him a good subject for mesmeric&#10;experiment. On two or three occasions I had put him to sleep with little&#10;difficulty, but was disappointed in other results which his peculiar&#10;constitution had naturally led me to anticipate. His will was at no&#10;period positively, or thoroughly, under my control, and in regard to&#10;clairvoyance, I could accomplish with him nothing to be relied upon. I&#10;always attributed my failure at these points to the disordered state of&#10;his health. For some months previous to my becoming acquainted with&#10;him, his physicians had declared him in a confirmed phthisis. It was his&#10;custom, indeed, to speak calmly of his approaching dissolution, as of a&#10;matter neither to be avoided nor regretted.&#10;&#10;When the ideas to which I have alluded first occurred to me, it was&#10;of course very natural that I should think of M. Valdemar. I knew the&#10;steady philosophy of the man too well to apprehend any scruples&#10;from him; and he had no relatives in America who would be likely to&#10;interfere. I spoke to him frankly upon the subject; and, to my surprise,&#10;his interest seemed vividly excited. I say to my surprise, for, although&#10;he had always yielded his person freely to my experiments, he had never&#10;before given me any tokens of sympathy with what I did. His disease was&#10;of that character which would admit of exact calculation in respect&#10;to the epoch of its termination in death; and it was finally arranged&#10;between us that he would send for me about twenty-four hours before the&#10;period announced by his physicians as that of his decease.&#10;&#10;It is now rather more than seven months since I received, from M.&#10;Valdemar himself, the subjoined note:&#10;&#10;My DEAR P---,&#10;&#10;You may as well come now. D---- and F---- are agreed that I cannot hold out&#10;beyond to-morrow midnight; and I think they have hit the time very&#10;nearly.&#10;&#10;VALDEMAR&#10;&#10;I received this note within half an hour after it was written, and in&#10;fifteen minutes more I was in the dying man's chamber. I had not seen&#10;him for ten days, and was appalled by the fearful alteration which the&#10;brief interval had wrought in him. His face wore a leaden hue; the eyes&#10;were utterly lustreless; and the emaciation was so extreme that the&#10;skin had been broken through by the cheek-bones. His expectoration was&#10;excessive. The pulse was barely perceptible. He retained, nevertheless,&#10;in a very remarkable manner, both his mental power and a certain degree&#10;of physical strength. He spoke with distinctness--took some palliative&#10;medicines without aid--and, when I entered the room, was occupied in&#10;penciling memoranda in a pocket-book. He was propped up in the bed by&#10;pillows. Doctors D---- and F---- were in attendance.&#10;&#10;After pressing Valdemar's hand, I took these gentlemen aside, and&#10;obtained from them a minute account of the patient's condition. The left&#10;lung had been for eighteen months in a semi-osseous or cartilaginous&#10;state, and was, of course, entirely useless for all purposes of&#10;vitality. The right, in its upper portion, was also partially, if&#10;not thoroughly, ossified, while the lower region was merely a mass&#10;of purulent tubercles, running one into another. Several extensive&#10;perforations existed; and, at one point, permanent adhesion to the&#10;ribs had taken place. These appearances in the right lobe were of&#10;comparatively recent date. The ossification had proceeded with very&#10;unusual rapidity; no sign of it had been discovered a month before, and&#10;the adhesion had only been observed during the three previous days.&#10;Independently of the phthisis, the patient was suspected of aneurism&#10;of the aorta; but on this point the osseous symptoms rendered an exact&#10;diagnosis impossible. It was the opinion of both physicians that M.&#10;Valdemar would die about midnight on the morrow (Sunday). It was then&#10;seven o'clock on Saturday evening.&#10;&#10;On quitting the invalid's bed-side to hold conversation with myself,&#10;Doctors D---- and F---- had bidden him a final farewell. It had not been their&#10;intention to return; but, at my request, they agreed to look in upon the&#10;patient about ten the next night.&#10;&#10;When they had gone, I spoke freely with M. Valdemar on the subject&#10;of his approaching dissolution, as well as, more particularly, of the&#10;experiment proposed. He still professed himself quite willing and even&#10;anxious to have it made, and urged me to commence it at once. A male and&#10;a female nurse were in attendance; but I did not feel myself altogether&#10;at liberty to engage in a task of this character with no more reliable&#10;witnesses than these people, in case of sudden accident, might prove.&#10;I therefore postponed operations until about eight the next night, when&#10;the arrival of a medical student with whom I had some acquaintance, (Mr.&#10;Theodore L--l,) relieved me from farther embarrassment. It had been my&#10;design, originally, to wait for the physicians; but I was induced to&#10;proceed, first, by the urgent entreaties of M. Valdemar, and secondly,&#10;by my conviction that I had not a moment to lose, as he was evidently&#10;sinking fast.&#10;&#10;Mr. L--l was so kind as to accede to my desire that he would take notes&#10;of all that occurred, and it is from his memoranda that what I now have&#10;to relate is, for the most part, either condensed or copied verbatim.&#10;&#10;It wanted about five minutes of eight when, taking the patient's hand, I&#10;begged him to state, as distinctly as he could, to Mr. L--l, whether he&#10;(M. Valdemar) was entirely willing that I should make the experiment of&#10;mesmerizing him in his then condition.&#10;&#10;He replied feebly, yet quite audibly, &quot;Yes, I wish to be. I fear you&#10;have mesmerized&quot;--adding immediately afterwards, &quot;deferred it too long.&quot;&#10;&#10;While he spoke thus, I commenced the passes which I had already found&#10;most effectual in subduing him. He was evidently influenced with the&#10;first lateral stroke of my hand across his forehead; but although I&#10;exerted all my powers, no further perceptible effect was induced&#10;until some minutes after ten o'clock, when Doctors D-- and F-- called,&#10;according to appointment. I explained to them, in a few words, what I&#10;designed, and as they opposed no objection, saying that the patient was&#10;already in the death agony, I proceeded without hesitation--exchanging,&#10;however, the lateral passes for downward ones, and directing my gaze&#10;entirely into the right eye of the sufferer.&#10;&#10;By this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing was&#10;stertorous, and at intervals of half a minute.&#10;&#10;This condition was nearly unaltered for a quarter of an hour. At the&#10;expiration of this period, however, a natural although a very deep&#10;sigh escaped the bosom of the dying man, and the stertorous breathing&#10;ceased--that is to say, its stertorousness was no longer apparent; the&#10;intervals were undiminished. The patient's extremities were of an icy&#10;coldness.&#10;&#10;At five minutes before eleven I perceived unequivocal signs of the&#10;mesmeric influence. The glassy roll of the eye was changed for that&#10;expression of uneasy inward examination which is never seen except in&#10;cases of sleep-waking, and which it is quite impossible to mistake.&#10;With a few rapid lateral passes I made the lids quiver, as in incipient&#10;sleep, and with a few more I closed them altogether. I was not&#10;satisfied, however, with this, but continued the manipulations&#10;vigorously, and with the fullest exertion of the will, until I had&#10;completely stiffened the limbs of the slumberer, after placing them in&#10;a seemingly easy position. The legs were at full length; the arms were&#10;nearly so, and reposed on the bed at a moderate distance from the loin.&#10;The head was very slightly elevated.&#10;&#10;When I had accomplished this, it was fully midnight, and I requested&#10;the gentlemen present to examine M. Valdemar's condition. After a few&#10;experiments, they admitted him to be an unusually perfect state of&#10;mesmeric trance. The curiosity of both the physicians was greatly&#10;excited. Dr. D---- resolved at once to remain with the patient all&#10;night, while Dr. F---- took leave with a promise to return at daybreak.&#10;Mr. L--l and the nurses remained.&#10;&#10;We left M. Valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three o'clock in&#10;the morning, when I approached him and found him in precisely the same&#10;condition as when Dr. F--went away--that is to say, he lay in the&#10;same position; the pulse was imperceptible; the breathing was gentle&#10;(scarcely noticeable, unless through the application of a mirror to the&#10;lips); the eyes were closed naturally; and the limbs were as rigid and&#10;as cold as marble. Still, the general appearance was certainly not that&#10;of death.&#10;&#10;As I approached M. Valdemar I made a kind of half effort to influence&#10;his right arm into pursuit of my own, as I passed the latter gently&#10;to and fro above his person. In such experiments with this patient I had&#10;never perfectly succeeded before, and assuredly I had little thought of&#10;succeeding now; but to my astonishment, his arm very readily, although&#10;feebly, followed every direction I assigned it with mine. I determined&#10;to hazard a few words of conversation.&#10;&#10;&quot;M. Valdemar,&quot; I said, &quot;are you asleep?&quot; He made no answer, but I&#10;perceived a tremor about the lips, and was thus induced to repeat the&#10;question, again and again. At its third repetition, his whole frame was&#10;agitated by a very slight shivering; the eyelids unclosed themselves so&#10;far as to display a white line of the ball; the lips moved sluggishly,&#10;and from between them, in a barely audible whisper, issued the words:&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes;--asleep now. Do not wake me!--let me die so!&quot;&#10;&#10;I here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever. The right arm,&#10;as before, obeyed the direction of my hand. I questioned the sleep-waker&#10;again:&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you still feel pain in the breast, M. Valdemar?&quot;&#10;&#10;The answer now was immediate, but even less audible than before: &quot;No&#10;pain--I am dying.&quot;&#10;&#10;I did not think it advisable to disturb him farther just then, and&#10;nothing more was said or done until the arrival of Dr. F--, who came a&#10;little before sunrise, and expressed unbounded astonishment at finding&#10;the patient still alive. After feeling the pulse and applying a mirror&#10;to the lips, he requested me to speak to the sleep-waker again. I did&#10;so, saying:&#10;&#10;&quot;M. Valdemar, do you still sleep?&quot;&#10;&#10;As before, some minutes elapsed ere a reply was made; and during the&#10;interval the dying man seemed to be collecting his energies to speak.&#10;At my fourth repetition of the question, he said very faintly, almost&#10;inaudibly:&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes; still asleep--dying.&quot;&#10;&#10;It was now the opinion, or rather the wish, of the physicians, that&#10;M. Valdemar should be suffered to remain undisturbed in his present&#10;apparently tranquil condition, until death should supervene--and this,&#10;it was generally agreed, must now take place within a few minutes. I&#10;concluded, however, to speak to him once more, and merely repeated my&#10;previous question.&#10;&#10;While I spoke, there came a marked change over the countenance of&#10;the sleep-waker. The eyes rolled themselves slowly open, the pupils&#10;disappearing upwardly; the skin generally assumed a cadaverous hue,&#10;resembling not so much parchment as white paper; and the circular hectic&#10;spots which, hitherto, had been strongly defined in the centre of each&#10;cheek, went out at once. I use this expression, because the&#10;suddenness of their departure put me in mind of nothing so much as the&#10;extinguishment of a candle by a puff of the breath. The upper lip,&#10;at the same time, writhed itself away from the teeth, which it had&#10;previously covered completely; while the lower jaw fell with an audible&#10;jerk, leaving the mouth widely extended, and disclosing in full view the&#10;swollen and blackened tongue. I presume that no member of the party&#10;then present had been unaccustomed to death-bed horrors; but so hideous&#10;beyond conception was the appearance of M. Valdemar at this moment, that&#10;there was a general shrinking back from the region of the bed.&#10;&#10;I now feel that I have reached a point of this narrative at which every&#10;reader will be startled into positive disbelief. It is my business,&#10;however, simply to proceed.&#10;&#10;There was no longer the faintest sign of vitality in M. Valdemar; and&#10;concluding him to be dead, we were consigning him to the charge of the&#10;nurses, when a strong vibratory motion was observable in the tongue.&#10;This continued for perhaps a minute. At the expiration of this period,&#10;there issued from the distended and motionless jaws a voice--such as it&#10;would be madness in me to attempt describing. There are, indeed, two or&#10;three epithets which might be considered as applicable to it in part; I&#10;might say, for example, that the sound was harsh, and broken and hollow;&#10;but the hideous whole is indescribable, for the simple reason that no&#10;similar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of humanity. There were two&#10;particulars, nevertheless, which I thought then, and still think, might&#10;fairly be stated as characteristic of the intonation--as well adapted to&#10;convey some idea of its unearthly peculiarity. In the first place, the&#10;voice seemed to reach our ears--at least mine--from a vast distance,&#10;or from some deep cavern within the earth. In the second place, it&#10;impressed me (I fear, indeed, that it will be impossible to make myself&#10;comprehended) as gelatinous or glutinous matters impress the sense of&#10;touch.&#10;&#10;I have spoken both of &quot;sound&quot; and of &quot;voice.&quot; I mean to say that&#10;the sound was one of distinct--of even wonderfully, thrillingly&#10;distinct--syllabification. M. Valdemar spoke--obviously in reply to the&#10;question I had propounded to him a few minutes before. I had asked him,&#10;it will be remembered, if he still slept. He now said:&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes;--no;--I have been sleeping--and now--now--I am dead.&quot;&#10;&#10;No person present even affected to deny, or attempted to repress, the&#10;unutterable, shuddering horror which these few words, thus uttered, were&#10;so well calculated to convey. Mr. L--l (the student) swooned. The nurses&#10;immediately left the chamber, and could not be induced to return. My own&#10;impressions I would not pretend to render intelligible to the reader.&#10;For nearly an hour, we busied ourselves, silently--without the utterance&#10;of a word--in endeavors to revive Mr. L--l. When he came to himself,&#10;we addressed ourselves again to an investigation of M. Valdemar's&#10;condition.&#10;&#10;It remained in all respects as I have last described it, with the&#10;exception that the mirror no longer afforded evidence of respiration. An&#10;attempt to draw blood from the arm failed. I should mention, too, that&#10;this limb was no farther subject to my will. I endeavored in vain to&#10;make it follow the direction of my hand. The only real indication,&#10;indeed, of the mesmeric influence, was now found in the vibratory&#10;movement of the tongue, whenever I addressed M. Valdemar a question.&#10;He seemed to be making an effort to reply, but had no longer sufficient&#10;volition. To queries put to him by any other person than myself he&#10;seemed utterly insensible--although I endeavored to place each member&#10;of the company in mesmeric rapport with him. I believe that I have now&#10;related all that is necessary to an understanding of the sleep-waker's&#10;state at this epoch. Other nurses were procured; and at ten o'clock I&#10;left the house in company with the two physicians and Mr. L--l.&#10;&#10;In the afternoon we all called again to see the patient. His condition&#10;remained precisely the same. We had now some discussion as to the&#10;propriety and feasibility of awakening him; but we had little difficulty&#10;in agreeing that no good purpose would be served by so doing. It was&#10;evident that, so far, death (or what is usually termed death) had been&#10;arrested by the mesmeric process. It seemed clear to us all that to&#10;awaken M. Valdemar would be merely to insure his instant, or at least&#10;his speedy dissolution.&#10;&#10;From this period until the close of last week--an interval of nearly&#10;seven months--we continued to make daily calls at M. Valdemar's house,&#10;accompanied, now and then, by medical and other friends. All this time&#10;the sleeper-waker remained exactly as I have last described him. The&#10;nurses' attentions were continual.&#10;&#10;It was on Friday last that we finally resolved to make the experiment&#10;of awakening or attempting to awaken him; and it is the (perhaps)&#10;unfortunate result of this latter experiment which has given rise to&#10;so much discussion in private circles--to so much of what I cannot help&#10;thinking unwarranted popular feeling.&#10;&#10;For the purpose of relieving M. Valdemar from the mesmeric trance, I&#10;made use of the customary passes. These, for a time, were unsuccessful.&#10;The first indication of revival was afforded by a partial descent of the&#10;iris. It was observed, as especially remarkable, that this lowering&#10;of the pupil was accompanied by the profuse out-flowing of a yellowish&#10;ichor (from beneath the lids) of a pungent and highly offensive odor.&#10;&#10;It was now suggested that I should attempt to influence the patient's&#10;arm, as heretofore. I made the attempt and failed. Dr. F--then intimated&#10;a desire to have me put a question. I did so, as follows:&#10;&#10;&quot;M. Valdemar, can you explain to us what are your feelings or wishes&#10;now?&quot;&#10;&#10;There was an instant return of the hectic circles on the cheeks; the&#10;tongue quivered, or rather rolled violently in the mouth (although the&#10;jaws and lips remained rigid as before;) and at length the same hideous&#10;voice which I have already described, broke forth:&#10;&#10;&quot;For God's sake!--quick!--quick!--put me to sleep--or, quick!--waken&#10;me!--quick!--I say to you that I am dead!&quot;&#10;&#10;I was thoroughly unnerved, and for an instant remained undecided what to&#10;do. At first I made an endeavor to re-compose the patient; but, failing&#10;in this through total abeyance of the will, I retraced my steps and as&#10;earnestly struggled to awaken him. In this attempt I soon saw that I&#10;should be successful--or at least I soon fancied that my success would&#10;be complete--and I am sure that all in the room were prepared to see the&#10;patient awaken.&#10;&#10;For what really occurred, however, it is quite impossible that any human&#10;being could have been prepared.&#10;&#10;As I rapidly made the mesmeric passes, amid ejaculations of &quot;dead!&#10;dead!&quot; absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from the lips of the&#10;sufferer, his whole frame at once--within the space of a single minute,&#10;or even less, shrunk--crumbled--absolutely rotted away beneath my hands.&#10;Upon the bed, before that whole company, there lay a nearly liquid mass&#10;of loathsome--of detestable putridity.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;THE BLACK CAT.&#10;&#10;FOR the most wild, yet most homely narrative which I am about to pen, I&#10;neither expect nor solicit belief. Mad indeed would I be to expect it,&#10;in a case where my very senses reject their own evidence. Yet, mad am I&#10;not--and very surely do I not dream. But to-morrow I die, and to-day&#10;I would unburthen my soul. My immediate purpose is to place before&#10;the world, plainly, succinctly, and without comment, a series of&#10;mere household events. In their consequences, these events have&#10;terrified--have tortured--have destroyed me. Yet I will not attempt to&#10;expound them. To me, they have presented little but Horror--to many&#10;they will seem less terrible than _barroques_. Hereafter, perhaps,&#10;some intellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the&#10;common-place--some intellect more calm, more logical, and far less&#10;excitable than my own, which will perceive, in the circumstances I&#10;detail with awe, nothing more than an ordinary succession of very&#10;natural causes and effects.&#10;&#10;From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my&#10;disposition. My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make&#10;me the jest of my companions. I was especially fond of animals, and was&#10;indulged by my parents with a great variety of pets. With these I spent&#10;most of my time, and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing&#10;them. This peculiarity of character grew with my growth, and in my&#10;manhood, I derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure. To&#10;those who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious&#10;dog, I need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or the&#10;intensity of the gratification thus derivable. There is something in the&#10;unselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly&#10;to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry&#10;friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere _Man_.&#10;&#10;I married early, and was happy to find in my wife a disposition not&#10;uncongenial with my own. Observing my partiality for domestic pets, she&#10;lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable kind. We&#10;had birds, gold-fish, a fine dog, rabbits, a small monkey, and _a cat_.&#10;&#10;This latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal, entirely black,&#10;and sagacious to an astonishing degree. In speaking of his intelligence,&#10;my wife, who at heart was not a little tinctured with superstition,&#10;made frequent allusion to the ancient popular notion, which regarded all&#10;black cats as witches in disguise. Not that she was ever _serious_ upon&#10;this point--and I mention the matter at all for no better reason than&#10;that it happens, just now, to be remembered.&#10;&#10;Pluto--this was the cat's name--was my favorite pet and playmate. I&#10;alone fed him, and he attended me wherever I went about the house. It&#10;was even with difficulty that I could prevent him from following me&#10;through the streets.&#10;&#10;Our friendship lasted, in this manner, for several years, during which&#10;my general temperament and character--through the instrumentality of the&#10;Fiend Intemperance--had (I blush to confess it) experienced a radical&#10;alteration for the worse. I grew, day by day, more moody, more&#10;irritable, more regardless of the feelings of others. I suffered myself&#10;to use intemperate language to my wife. At length, I even offered her&#10;personal violence. My pets, of course, were made to feel the change&#10;in my disposition. I not only neglected, but ill-used them. For&#10;Pluto, however, I still retained sufficient regard to restrain me from&#10;maltreating him, as I made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits, the&#10;monkey, or even the dog, when by accident, or through affection, they&#10;came in my way. But my disease grew upon me--for what disease is like&#10;Alcohol!--and at length even Pluto, who was now becoming old, and&#10;consequently somewhat peevish--even Pluto began to experience the&#10;effects of my ill temper.&#10;&#10;One night, returning home, much intoxicated, from one of my haunts about&#10;town, I fancied that the cat avoided my presence. I seized him; when, in&#10;his fright at my violence, he inflicted a slight wound upon my hand with&#10;his teeth. The fury of a demon instantly possessed me. I knew myself&#10;no longer. My original soul seemed, at once, to take its flight from my&#10;body and a more than fiendish malevolence, gin-nurtured, thrilled every&#10;fibre of my frame. I took from my waistcoat-pocket a pen-knife, opened&#10;it, grasped the poor beast by the throat, and deliberately cut one of&#10;its eyes from the socket! I blush, I burn, I shudder, while I pen the&#10;damnable atrocity.&#10;&#10;When reason returned with the morning--when I had slept off the fumes of&#10;the night's debauch--I experienced a sentiment half of horror, half of&#10;remorse, for the crime of which I had been guilty; but it was, at best,&#10;a feeble and equivocal feeling, and the soul remained untouched. I again&#10;plunged into excess, and soon drowned in wine all memory of the deed.&#10;&#10;In the meantime the cat slowly recovered. The socket of the lost eye&#10;presented, it is true, a frightful appearance, but he no longer appeared&#10;to suffer any pain. He went about the house as usual, but, as might be&#10;expected, fled in extreme terror at my approach. I had so much of my&#10;old heart left, as to be at first grieved by this evident dislike on&#10;the part of a creature which had once so loved me. But this feeling&#10;soon gave place to irritation. And then came, as if to my final and&#10;irrevocable overthrow, the spirit of PERVERSENESS. Of this spirit&#10;philosophy takes no account. Yet I am not more sure that my soul lives,&#10;than I am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of the&#10;human heart--one of the indivisible primary faculties, or sentiments,&#10;which give direction to the character of Man. Who has not, a hundred&#10;times, found himself committing a vile or a silly action, for no other&#10;reason than because he knows he should not? Have we not a perpetual&#10;inclination, in the teeth of our best judgment, to violate that which&#10;is _Law_, merely because we understand it to be such? This spirit&#10;of perverseness, I say, came to my final overthrow. It was this&#10;unfathomable longing of the soul _to vex itself_--to offer violence to&#10;its own nature--to do wrong for the wrong's sake only--that urged me to&#10;continue and finally to consummate the injury I had inflicted upon the&#10;unoffending brute. One morning, in cool blood, I slipped a noose about&#10;its neck and hung it to the limb of a tree;--hung it with the&#10;tears streaming from my eyes, and with the bitterest remorse at my&#10;heart;--hung it _because_ I knew that it had loved me, and _because_&#10;I felt it had given me no reason of offence;--hung it _because_ I knew&#10;that in so doing I was committing a sin--a deadly sin that would&#10;so jeopardize my immortal soul as to place it--if such a thing wore&#10;possible--even beyond the reach of the infinite mercy of the Most&#10;Merciful and Most Terrible God.&#10;&#10;On the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done, I was aroused&#10;from sleep by the cry of fire. The curtains of my bed were in flames.&#10;The whole house was blazing. It was with great difficulty that my wife,&#10;a servant, and myself, made our escape from the conflagration. The&#10;destruction was complete. My entire worldly wealth was swallowed up, and&#10;I resigned myself thenceforward to despair.&#10;&#10;I am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of cause&#10;and effect, between the disaster and the atrocity. But I am detailing a&#10;chain of facts--and wish not to leave even a possible link imperfect.&#10;On the day succeeding the fire, I visited the ruins. The walls, with&#10;one exception, had fallen in. This exception was found in a compartment&#10;wall, not very thick, which stood about the middle of the house, and&#10;against which had rested the head of my bed. The plastering had here,&#10;in great measure, resisted the action of the fire--a fact which I&#10;attributed to its having been recently spread. About this wall a&#10;dense crowd were collected, and many persons seemed to be examining a&#10;particular portion of it with very minute and eager attention. The&#10;words &quot;strange!&quot; &quot;singular!&quot; and other similar expressions, excited my&#10;curiosity. I approached and saw, as if graven in _bas relief_ upon the&#10;white surface, the figure of a gigantic _cat_. The impression was given&#10;with an accuracy truly marvellous. There was a rope about the animal's&#10;neck.&#10;&#10;When I first beheld this apparition--for I could scarcely regard it as&#10;less--my wonder and my terror were extreme. But at length reflection&#10;came to my aid. The cat, I remembered, had been hung in a garden&#10;adjacent to the house. Upon the alarm of fire, this garden had been&#10;immediately filled by the crowd--by some one of whom the animal must&#10;have been cut from the tree and thrown, through an open window, into my&#10;chamber. This had probably been done with the view of arousing me&#10;from sleep. The falling of other walls had compressed the victim of my&#10;cruelty into the substance of the freshly-spread plaster; the lime of&#10;which, with the flames, and the _ammonia_ from the carcass, had then&#10;accomplished the portraiture as I saw it.&#10;&#10;Although I thus readily accounted to my reason, if not altogether to my&#10;conscience, for the startling fact just detailed, it did not the less&#10;fail to make a deep impression upon my fancy. For months I could not rid&#10;myself of the phantasm of the cat; and, during this period, there came&#10;back into my spirit a half-sentiment that seemed, but was not, remorse.&#10;I went so far as to regret the loss of the animal, and to look about me,&#10;among the vile haunts which I now habitually frequented, for another pet&#10;of the same species, and of somewhat similar appearance, with which to&#10;supply its place.&#10;&#10;One night as I sat, half stupified, in a den of more than infamy, my&#10;attention was suddenly drawn to some black object, reposing upon&#10;the head of one of the immense hogsheads of Gin, or of Rum, which&#10;constituted the chief furniture of the apartment. I had been looking&#10;steadily at the top of this hogshead for some minutes, and what now&#10;caused me surprise was the fact that I had not sooner perceived the&#10;object thereupon. I approached it, and touched it with my hand. It was&#10;a black cat--a very large one--fully as large as Pluto, and closely&#10;resembling him in every respect but one. Pluto had not a white hair upon&#10;any portion of his body; but this cat had a large, although indefinite&#10;splotch of white, covering nearly the whole region of the breast. Upon&#10;my touching him, he immediately arose, purred loudly, rubbed against my&#10;hand, and appeared delighted with my notice. This, then, was the very&#10;creature of which I was in search. I at once offered to purchase it&#10;of the landlord; but this person made no claim to it--knew nothing of&#10;it--had never seen it before.&#10;&#10;I continued my caresses, and, when I prepared to go home, the animal&#10;evinced a disposition to accompany me. I permitted it to do so;&#10;occasionally stooping and patting it as I proceeded. When it reached&#10;the house it domesticated itself at once, and became immediately a great&#10;favorite with my wife.&#10;&#10;For my own part, I soon found a dislike to it arising within me. This&#10;was just the reverse of what I had anticipated; but--I know not how&#10;or why it was--its evident fondness for myself rather disgusted and&#10;annoyed. By slow degrees, these feelings of disgust and annoyance rose&#10;into the bitterness of hatred. I avoided the creature; a certain sense&#10;of shame, and the remembrance of my former deed of cruelty, preventing&#10;me from physically abusing it. I did not, for some weeks, strike, or&#10;otherwise violently ill use it; but gradually--very gradually--I came&#10;to look upon it with unutterable loathing, and to flee silently from its&#10;odious presence, as from the breath of a pestilence.&#10;&#10;What added, no doubt, to my hatred of the beast, was the discovery, on&#10;the morning after I brought it home, that, like Pluto, it also had been&#10;deprived of one of its eyes. This circumstance, however, only endeared&#10;it to my wife, who, as I have already said, possessed, in a high degree,&#10;that humanity of feeling which had once been my distinguishing trait,&#10;and the source of many of my simplest and purest pleasures.&#10;&#10;With my aversion to this cat, however, its partiality for myself seemed&#10;to increase. It followed my footsteps with a pertinacity which it would&#10;be difficult to make the reader comprehend. Whenever I sat, it would&#10;crouch beneath my chair, or spring upon my knees, covering me with its&#10;loathsome caresses. If I arose to walk it would get between my feet and&#10;thus nearly throw me down, or, fastening its long and sharp claws in my&#10;dress, clamber, in this manner, to my breast. At such times, although&#10;I longed to destroy it with a blow, I was yet withheld from so doing,&#10;partly by a memory of my former crime, but chiefly--let me confess it at&#10;once--by absolute dread of the beast.&#10;&#10;This dread was not exactly a dread of physical evil--and yet I should be&#10;at a loss how otherwise to define it. I am almost ashamed to own--yes,&#10;even in this felon's cell, I am almost ashamed to own--that the terror&#10;and horror with which the animal inspired me, had been heightened by one&#10;of the merest chimaeras it would be possible to conceive. My wife had&#10;called my attention, more than once, to the character of the mark of&#10;white hair, of which I have spoken, and which constituted the sole&#10;visible difference between the strange beast and the one I had&#10;destroyed. The reader will remember that this mark, although large, had&#10;been originally very indefinite; but, by slow degrees--degrees nearly&#10;imperceptible, and which for a long time my Reason struggled to reject&#10;as fanciful--it had, at length, assumed a rigorous distinctness of&#10;outline. It was now the representation of an object that I shudder to&#10;name--and for this, above all, I loathed, and dreaded, and would have&#10;rid myself of the monster _had I dared_--it was now, I say, the image&#10;of a hideous--of a ghastly thing--of the GALLOWS!--oh, mournful and&#10;terrible engine of Horror and of Crime--of Agony and of Death!&#10;&#10;And now was I indeed wretched beyond the wretchedness of mere Humanity.&#10;And _a brute beast _--whose fellow I had contemptuously destroyed--_a&#10;brute beast_ to work out for _me_--for me a man, fashioned in the image&#10;of the High God--so much of insufferable wo! Alas! neither by day nor&#10;by night knew I the blessing of Rest any more! During the former the&#10;creature left me no moment alone; and, in the latter, I started, hourly,&#10;from dreams of unutterable fear, to find the hot breath of _the thing_&#10;upon my face, and its vast weight--an incarnate Night-Mare that I had no&#10;power to shake off--incumbent eternally upon my _heart!_&#10;&#10;Beneath the pressure of torments such as these, the feeble remnant&#10;of the good within me succumbed. Evil thoughts became my sole&#10;intimates--the darkest and most evil of thoughts. The moodiness of&#10;my usual temper increased to hatred of all things and of all mankind;&#10;while, from the sudden, frequent, and ungovernable outbursts of a fury&#10;to which I now blindly abandoned myself, my uncomplaining wife, alas!&#10;was the most usual and the most patient of sufferers.&#10;&#10;One day she accompanied me, upon some household errand, into the cellar&#10;of the old building which our poverty compelled us to inhabit. The cat&#10;followed me down the steep stairs, and, nearly throwing me headlong,&#10;exasperated me to madness. Uplifting an axe, and forgetting, in my&#10;wrath, the childish dread which had hitherto stayed my hand, I aimed a&#10;blow at the animal which, of course, would have proved instantly fatal&#10;had it descended as I wished. But this blow was arrested by the hand of&#10;my wife. Goaded, by the interference, into a rage more than demoniacal,&#10;I withdrew my arm from her grasp and buried the axe in her brain. She&#10;fell dead upon the spot, without a groan.&#10;&#10;This hideous murder accomplished, I set myself forthwith, and with&#10;entire deliberation, to the task of concealing the body. I knew that I&#10;could not remove it from the house, either by day or by night, without&#10;the risk of being observed by the neighbors. Many projects entered&#10;my mind. At one period I thought of cutting the corpse into minute&#10;fragments, and destroying them by fire. At another, I resolved to dig&#10;a grave for it in the floor of the cellar. Again, I deliberated about&#10;casting it in the well in the yard--about packing it in a box, as if&#10;merchandize, with the usual arrangements, and so getting a porter to&#10;take it from the house. Finally I hit upon what I considered a far&#10;better expedient than either of these. I determined to wall it up in the&#10;cellar--as the monks of the middle ages are recorded to have walled up&#10;their victims.&#10;&#10;For a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted. Its walls were&#10;loosely constructed, and had lately been plastered throughout with a&#10;rough plaster, which the dampness of the atmosphere had prevented from&#10;hardening. Moreover, in one of the walls was a projection, caused by&#10;a false chimney, or fireplace, that had been filled up, and made to&#10;resemble the red of the cellar. I made no doubt that I could readily&#10;displace the bricks at this point, insert the corpse, and wall the whole&#10;up as before, so that no eye could detect any thing suspicious. And in&#10;this calculation I was not deceived. By means of a crow-bar I easily&#10;dislodged the bricks, and, having carefully deposited the body against&#10;the inner wall, I propped it in that position, while, with little&#10;trouble, I re-laid the whole structure as it originally stood. Having&#10;procured mortar, sand, and hair, with every possible precaution, I&#10;prepared a plaster which could not be distinguished from the old, and&#10;with this I very carefully went over the new brickwork. When I had&#10;finished, I felt satisfied that all was right. The wall did not present&#10;the slightest appearance of having been disturbed. The rubbish on&#10;the floor was picked up with the minutest care. I looked around&#10;triumphantly, and said to myself--&quot;Here at least, then, my labor has not&#10;been in vain.&quot;&#10;&#10;My next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause of so&#10;much wretchedness; for I had, at length, firmly resolved to put it to&#10;death. Had I been able to meet with it, at the moment, there could have&#10;been no doubt of its fate; but it appeared that the crafty animal had&#10;been alarmed at the violence of my previous anger, and forebore to&#10;present itself in my present mood. It is impossible to describe, or to&#10;imagine, the deep, the blissful sense of relief which the absence of the&#10;detested creature occasioned in my bosom. It did not make its&#10;appearance during the night--and thus for one night at least, since its&#10;introduction into the house, I soundly and tranquilly slept; aye, slept&#10;even with the burden of murder upon my soul!&#10;&#10;The second and the third day passed, and still my tormentor came not.&#10;Once again I breathed as a freeman. The monster, in terror, had fled the&#10;premises forever! I should behold it no more! My happiness was supreme!&#10;The guilt of my dark deed disturbed me but little. Some few inquiries&#10;had been made, but these had been readily answered. Even a search had&#10;been instituted--but of course nothing was to be discovered. I looked&#10;upon my future felicity as secured.&#10;&#10;Upon the fourth day of the assassination, a party of the police came,&#10;very unexpectedly, into the house, and proceeded again to make rigorous&#10;investigation of the premises. Secure, however, in the inscrutability of&#10;my place of concealment, I felt no embarrassment whatever. The officers&#10;bade me accompany them in their search. They left no nook or corner&#10;unexplored. At length, for the third or fourth time, they descended into&#10;the cellar. I quivered not in a muscle. My heart beat calmly as that of&#10;one who slumbers in innocence. I walked the cellar from end to end. I&#10;folded my arms upon my bosom, and roamed easily to and fro. The police&#10;were thoroughly satisfied and prepared to depart. The glee at my heart&#10;was too strong to be restrained. I burned to say if but one word, by&#10;way of triumph, and to render doubly sure their assurance of my&#10;guiltlessness.&#10;&#10;&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; I said at last, as the party ascended the steps, &quot;I delight&#10;to have allayed your suspicions. I wish you all health, and a little&#10;more courtesy. By the bye, gentlemen, this--this is a very well&#10;constructed house.&quot; [In the rabid desire to say something easily, I&#10;scarcely knew what I uttered at all.]--&quot;I may say an _excellently_ well&#10;constructed house. These walls--are you going, gentlemen?--these walls&#10;are solidly put together;&quot; and here, through the mere phrenzy of&#10;bravado, I rapped heavily, with a cane which I held in my hand, upon&#10;that very portion of the brick-work behind which stood the corpse of the&#10;wife of my bosom.&#10;&#10;But may God shield and deliver me from the fangs of the Arch-Fiend! No&#10;sooner had the reverberation of my blows sunk into silence, than I was&#10;answered by a voice from within the tomb!--by a cry, at first muffled&#10;and broken, like the sobbing of a child, and then quickly swelling into&#10;one long, loud, and continuous scream, utterly anomalous and inhuman--a&#10;howl--a wailing shriek, half of horror and half of triumph, such as&#10;might have arisen only out of hell, conjointly from the throats of the&#10;dammed in their agony and of the demons that exult in the damnation.&#10;&#10;Of my own thoughts it is folly to speak. Swooning, I staggered to&#10;the opposite wall. For one instant the party upon the stairs remained&#10;motionless, through extremity of terror and of awe. In the next, a dozen&#10;stout arms were toiling at the wall. It fell bodily. The corpse, already&#10;greatly decayed and clotted with gore, stood erect before the eyes of&#10;the spectators. Upon its head, with red extended mouth and solitary eye&#10;of fire, sat the hideous beast whose craft had seduced me into murder,&#10;and whose informing voice had consigned me to the hangman. I had walled&#10;the monster up within the tomb!&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER&#10;&#10;     Son coeur est un luth suspendu;&#10;     SitÃ´t qu'on le touche il rÃ¨sonne..&#10;&#10;                             _  De BÃ©ranger_.&#10;&#10;DURING the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the&#10;year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had&#10;been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of&#10;country; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew&#10;on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher. I know not how&#10;it was--but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of&#10;insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the&#10;feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic,&#10;sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest&#10;natural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the scene&#10;before me--upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the&#10;domain--upon the bleak walls--upon the vacant eye-like windows--upon a&#10;few rank sedges--and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees--with an&#10;utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation&#10;more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium--the&#10;bitter lapse into everyday life--the hideous dropping off of the veil.&#10;There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart--an unredeemed&#10;dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture&#10;into aught of the sublime. What was it--I paused to think--what was it&#10;that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the House of Usher? It was a&#10;mystery all insoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that&#10;crowded upon me as I pondered. I was forced to fall back upon the&#10;unsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there _are_&#10;combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus&#10;affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among considerations&#10;beyond our depth. It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different&#10;arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the&#10;picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its&#10;capacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined&#10;my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in&#10;unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down--but with a shudder&#10;even more thrilling than before--upon the remodelled and inverted images&#10;of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the vacant and&#10;eye-like windows.&#10;&#10;Nevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a&#10;sojourn of some weeks. Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been one of&#10;my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our last&#10;meeting. A letter, however, had lately reached me in a distant part of&#10;the country--a letter from him--which, in its wildly importunate nature,&#10;had admitted of no other than a personal reply. The MS. gave evidence of&#10;nervous agitation. The writer spoke of acute bodily illness--of a mental&#10;disorder which oppressed him--and of an earnest desire to see me, as his&#10;best, and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of attempting, by&#10;the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his malady. It&#10;was the manner in which all this, and much more, was said--it was the&#10;apparent _heart_ that went with his request--which allowed me no&#10;room for hesitation; and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what I still&#10;considered a very singular summons.&#10;&#10;Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I really&#10;knew little of my friend. His reserve had been always excessive and&#10;habitual. I was aware, however, that his very ancient family had been&#10;noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament,&#10;displaying itself, through long ages, in many works of exalted art, and&#10;manifested, of late, in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive&#10;charity, as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps&#10;even more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties, of&#10;musical science. I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the&#10;stem of the Usher race, all time-honored as it was, had put forth, at no&#10;period, any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay&#10;in the direct line of descent, and had always, with very trifling and&#10;very temporary variation, so lain. It was this deficiency, I considered,&#10;while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of&#10;the premises with the accredited character of the people, and while&#10;speculating upon the possible influence which the one, in the long&#10;lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other--it was this&#10;deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent undeviating&#10;transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with the name, which&#10;had, at length, so identified the two as to merge the original title&#10;of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the &quot;House&#10;of Usher&quot;--an appellation which seemed to include, in the minds of the&#10;peasantry who used it, both the family and the family mansion.&#10;&#10;I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish&#10;experiment--that of looking down within the tarn--had been to deepen the&#10;first singular impression. There can be no doubt that the consciousness&#10;of the rapid increase of my superstition--for why should I not so term&#10;it?--served mainly to accelerate the increase itself. Such, I have&#10;long known, is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a&#10;basis. And it might have been for this reason only, that, when I again&#10;uplifted my eyes to the house itself, from its image in the pool, there&#10;grew in my mind a strange fancy--a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I&#10;but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed&#10;me. I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that&#10;about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar&#10;to themselves and their immediate vicinity--an atmosphere which had&#10;no affinity with the air of heaven, but which had reeked up from the&#10;decayed trees, and the gray wall, and the silent tarn--a pestilent and&#10;mystic vapor, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued.&#10;&#10;Shaking off from my spirit what _must_ have been a dream, I scanned more&#10;narrowly the real aspect of the building. Its principal feature seemed&#10;to be that of an excessive antiquity. The discoloration of ages had been&#10;great. Minute fungi overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine&#10;tangled web-work from the eaves. Yet all this was apart from any&#10;extraordinary dilapidation. No portion of the masonry had fallen; and&#10;there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect&#10;adaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the individual&#10;stones. In this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality&#10;of old wood-work which has rotted for long years in some neglected&#10;vault, with no disturbance from the breath of the external air. Beyond&#10;this indication of extensive decay, however, the fabric gave little&#10;token of instability. Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might&#10;have discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending from the&#10;roof of the building in front, made its way down the wall in a zigzag&#10;direction, until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn.&#10;&#10;Noticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house. A&#10;servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic archway of&#10;the hall. A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me, in silence,&#10;through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the _studio_&#10;of his master. Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know&#10;not how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already&#10;spoken. While the objects around me--while the carvings of the ceilings,&#10;the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebon blackness of the floors,&#10;and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as I strode, were&#10;but matters to which, or to such as which, I had been accustomed from my&#10;infancy--while I hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all&#10;this--I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which&#10;ordinary images were stirring up. On one of the staircases, I met the&#10;physician of the family. His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled&#10;expression of low cunning and perplexity. He accosted me with&#10;trepidation and passed on. The valet now threw open a door and ushered&#10;me into the presence of his master.&#10;&#10;The room in which I found myself was very large and lofty. The windows&#10;were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from the black&#10;oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within. Feeble gleams&#10;of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellissed panes,&#10;and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects&#10;around; the eye, however, struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles&#10;of the chamber, or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling.&#10;Dark draperies hung upon the walls. The general furniture was profuse,&#10;comfortless, antique, and tattered. Many books and musical instruments&#10;lay scattered about, but failed to give any vitality to the scene. I&#10;felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow. An air of stern, deep, and&#10;irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all.&#10;&#10;Upon my entrance, Usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at&#10;full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in&#10;it, I at first thought, of an overdone cordiality--of the constrained&#10;effort of the _ennuyÃ©_ man of the world. A glance, however, at his&#10;countenance, convinced me of his perfect sincerity. We sat down; and for&#10;some moments, while he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half&#10;of pity, half of awe. Surely, man had never before so terribly altered,&#10;in so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher! It was with difficulty that&#10;I could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me&#10;with the companion of my early boyhood. Yet the character of his face&#10;had been at all times remarkable. A cadaverousness of complexion; an eye&#10;large, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and&#10;very pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a&#10;delicate Hebrew model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar&#10;formations; a finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence,&#10;of a want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and&#10;tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the regions&#10;of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not easily to be&#10;forgotten. And now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character&#10;of these features, and of the expression they were wont to convey, lay&#10;so much of change that I doubted to whom I spoke. The now ghastly pallor&#10;of the skin, and the now miraculous lustre of the eye, above all things&#10;startled and even awed me. The silken hair, too, had been suffered to&#10;grow all unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated&#10;rather than fell about the face, I could not, even with effort, connect&#10;its Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.&#10;&#10;In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence--an&#10;inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from a series of feeble&#10;and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy--an excessive&#10;nervous agitation. For something of this nature I had indeed been&#10;prepared, no less by his letter, than by reminiscences of certain&#10;boyish traits, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical&#10;conformation and temperament. His action was alternately vivacious and&#10;sullen. His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the&#10;animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance) to that species of energetic&#10;concision--that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding&#10;enunciation--that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated&#10;guttural utterance, which may be observed in the lost drunkard, or the&#10;irreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of his most intense&#10;excitement.&#10;&#10;It was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest&#10;desire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to afford him. He&#10;entered, at some length, into what he conceived to be the nature of his&#10;malady. It was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and one&#10;for which he despaired to find a remedy--a mere nervous affection, he&#10;immediately added, which would undoubtedly soon pass off. It displayed&#10;itself in a host of unnatural sensations. Some of these, as he detailed&#10;them, interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms, and&#10;the general manner of the narration had their weight. He suffered much&#10;from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food was alone&#10;endurable; he could wear only garments of certain texture; the odors&#10;of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were tortured by even a faint&#10;light; and there were but peculiar sounds, and these from stringed&#10;instruments, which did not inspire him with horror.&#10;&#10;To an anomalous species of terror I found him a bounden slave. &quot;I shall&#10;perish,&quot; said he, &quot;I must perish in this deplorable folly. Thus, thus,&#10;and not otherwise, shall I be lost. I dread the events of the future,&#10;not in themselves, but in their results. I shudder at the thought&#10;of any, even the most trivial, incident, which may operate upon this&#10;intolerable agitation of soul. I have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger,&#10;except in its absolute effect--in terror. In this unnerved--in this&#10;pitiable condition--I feel that the period will sooner or later arrive&#10;when I must abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with the&#10;grim phantasm, FEAR.&quot;&#10;&#10;I learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and equivocal&#10;hints, another singular feature of his mental condition. He was&#10;enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling&#10;which he tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had never ventured&#10;forth--in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed&#10;in terms too shadowy here to be re-stated--an influence which some&#10;peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion, had,&#10;by dint of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit--an effect&#10;which the _physique_ of the gray walls and turrets, and of the dim tarn&#10;into which they all looked down, had, at length, brought about upon the&#10;_morale_ of his existence.&#10;&#10;He admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the&#10;peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more&#10;natural and far more palpable origin--to the severe and long-continued&#10;illness--indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution--of a tenderly&#10;beloved sister--his sole companion for long years--his last and only&#10;relative on earth. &quot;Her decease,&quot; he said, with a bitterness which I can&#10;never forget, &quot;would leave him (him the hopeless and the frail) the last&#10;of the ancient race of the Ushers.&quot; While he spoke, the lady Madeline&#10;(for so was she called) passed slowly through a remote portion of the&#10;apartment, and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared. I&#10;regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread--and&#10;yet I found it impossible to account for such feelings. A sensation of&#10;stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps. When a&#10;door, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought instinctively and&#10;eagerly the countenance of the brother--but he had buried his face&#10;in his hands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary&#10;wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many&#10;passionate tears.&#10;&#10;The disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of her&#10;physicians. A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the person,&#10;and frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical&#10;character, were the unusual diagnosis. Hitherto she had steadily borne&#10;up against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken herself&#10;finally to bed; but, on the closing in of the evening of my arrival&#10;at the house, she succumbed (as her brother told me at night with&#10;inexpressible agitation) to the prostrating power of the destroyer;&#10;and I learned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person would thus&#10;probably be the last I should obtain--that the lady, at least while&#10;living, would be seen by me no more.&#10;&#10;For several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either Usher or&#10;myself: and during this period I was busied in earnest endeavors to&#10;alleviate the melancholy of my friend. We painted and read together; or&#10;I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his speaking&#10;guitar. And thus, as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more&#10;unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did&#10;I perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which&#10;darkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all&#10;objects of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing radiation&#10;of gloom.&#10;&#10;I shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I thus&#10;spent alone with the master of the House of Usher. Yet I should fail in&#10;any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies,&#10;or of the occupations, in which he involved me, or led me the way. An&#10;excited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over&#10;all. His long improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears. Among&#10;other things, I hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and&#10;amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of Von Weber. From the&#10;paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touch&#10;by touch, into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the more thrillingly,&#10;because I shuddered knowing not why;--from these paintings (vivid as&#10;their images now are before me) I would in vain endeavor to educe more&#10;than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely&#10;written words. By the utter simplicity, by the nakedness of his designs,&#10;he arrested and overawed attention. If ever mortal painted an idea, that&#10;mortal was Roderick Usher. For me at least--in the circumstances then&#10;surrounding me--there arose out of the pure abstractions which the&#10;hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvass, an intensity of&#10;intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt I ever yet in the contemplation&#10;of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of Fuseli.&#10;&#10;One of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking not so&#10;rigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth, although&#10;feebly, in words. A small picture presented the interior of an immensely&#10;long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls, smooth, white, and&#10;without interruption or device. Certain accessory points of the design&#10;served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding&#10;depth below the surface of the earth. No outlet was observed in any&#10;portion of its vast extent, and no torch, or other artificial source of&#10;light was discernible; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout,&#10;and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendor.&#10;&#10;I have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which&#10;rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with the exception of&#10;certain effects of stringed instruments. It was, perhaps, the narrow&#10;limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar, which gave&#10;birth, in great measure, to the fantastic character of his performances.&#10;But the fervid _facility_ of his _impromptus_ could not be so accounted&#10;for. They must have been, and were, in the notes, as well as in the&#10;words of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently accompanied himself&#10;with rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of that intense mental&#10;collectedness and concentration to which I have previously alluded&#10;as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial&#10;excitement. The words of one of these rhapsodies I have easily&#10;remembered. I was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed with it, as&#10;he gave it, because, in the under or mystic current of its meaning, I&#10;fancied that I perceived, and for the first time, a full consciousness&#10;on the part of Usher, of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her&#10;throne. The verses, which were entitled &quot;The Haunted Palace,&quot; ran very&#10;nearly, if not accurately, thus:&#10;&#10;                         I.&#10;     In the greenest of our valleys,&#10;         By good angels tenanted,&#10;     Once a fair and stately palace--&#10;         Radiant palace--reared its head.&#10;     In the monarch Thought's dominion--&#10;         It stood there!&#10;     Never seraph spread a pinion&#10;         Over fabric half so fair.&#10;                         II.&#10;     Banners yellow, glorious, golden,&#10;         On its roof did float and flow;&#10;     (This--all this--was in the olden&#10;         Time long ago)&#10;     And every gentle air that dallied,&#10;         In that sweet day,&#10;     Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,&#10;         A winged odor went away.&#10;                         III.&#10;     Wanderers in that happy valley&#10;         Through two luminous windows saw&#10;     Spirits moving musically&#10;         To a lute's well-tunÃ©d law,&#10;     Round about a throne, where sitting&#10;         (Porphyrogene!)&#10;     In state his glory well befitting,&#10;         The ruler of the realm was seen.&#10;                          IV.&#10;     And all with pearl and ruby glowing&#10;         Was the fair palace door,&#10;     Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,&#10;         And sparkling evermore,&#10;     A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty&#10;         Was but to sing,&#10;     In voices of surpassing beauty,&#10;         The wit and wisdom of their king.&#10;                         V.&#10;     But evil things, in robes of sorrow,&#10;         Assailed the monarch's high estate;&#10;     (Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow&#10;         Shall dawn upon him, desolate!)&#10;     And, round about his home, the glory&#10;         That blushed and bloomed&#10;     Is but a dim-remembered story&#10;         Of the old time entombed.&#10;                         VI.&#10;     And travellers now within that valley,&#10;         Through the red-litten windows, see&#10;     Vast forms that move fantastically&#10;         To a discordant melody;&#10;     While, like a rapid ghastly river,&#10;         Through the pale door,&#10;     A hideous throng rush out forever,&#10;         And laugh--but smile no more.&#10;&#10;I well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad, led us into&#10;a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of Usher's&#10;which I mention not so much on account of its novelty, (for other men&#10;* have thought thus,) as on account of the pertinacity with which&#10;he maintained it. This opinion, in its general form, was that of the&#10;sentience of all vegetable things. But, in his disordered fancy, the&#10;idea had assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under certain&#10;conditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization. I lack words to express&#10;the full extent, or the earnest _abandon_ of his persuasion. The belief,&#10;however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with the gray&#10;stones of the home of his forefathers. The conditions of the sentience&#10;had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation of&#10;these stones--in the order of their arrangement, as well as in that of&#10;the many _fungi_ which overspread them, and of the decayed trees which&#10;stood around--above all, in the long undisturbed endurance of this&#10;arrangement, and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn.&#10;Its evidence--the evidence of the sentience--was to be seen, he&#10;said, (and I here started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certain&#10;condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the&#10;walls. The result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet&#10;importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the&#10;destinies of his family, and which made _him_ what I now saw him--what&#10;he was. Such opinions need no comment, and I will make none.&#10;&#10;* Watson, Dr. Percival, Spallanzani, and especially the Bishop of&#10;Landaff.--See &quot;Chemical Essays,&quot; vol v.&#10;&#10;Our books--the books which, for years, had formed no small portion of&#10;the mental existence of the invalid--were, as might be supposed, in&#10;strict keeping with this character of phantasm. We pored together over&#10;such works as the Ververt et Chartreuse of Gresset; the Belphegor of&#10;Machiavelli; the Heaven and Hell of Swedenborg; the Subterranean Voyage&#10;of Nicholas Klimm by Holberg; the Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of Jean&#10;D'IndaginÃ©, and of De la Chambre; the Journey into the Blue Distance of&#10;Tieck; and the City of the Sun of Campanella. One favorite volume was&#10;a small octavo edition of the _Directorium Inquisitorium_, by the&#10;Dominican Eymeric de Gironne; and there were passages in Pomponius Mela,&#10;about the old African Satyrs and OEgipans, over which Usher would sit&#10;dreaming for hours. His chief delight, however, was found in the perusal&#10;of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto Gothic--the manual of&#10;a forgotten church--the _Vigiliae Mortuorum secundum Chorum Ecclesiae&#10;Maguntinae_.&#10;&#10;I could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its&#10;probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening, having&#10;informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more, he stated his&#10;intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight, (previously to its&#10;final interment,) in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls&#10;of the building. The worldly reason, however, assigned for this singular&#10;proceeding, was one which I did not feel at liberty to dispute. The&#10;brother had been led to his resolution (so he told me) by consideration&#10;of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased, of certain&#10;obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men, and of the&#10;remote and exposed situation of the burial-ground of the family. I will&#10;not deny that when I called to mind the sinister countenance of the&#10;person whom I met upon the staircase, on the day of my arrival at&#10;the house, I had no desire to oppose what I regarded as at best but a&#10;harmless, and by no means an unnatural, precaution.&#10;&#10;At the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the arrangements for&#10;the temporary entombment. The body having been encoffined, we two alone&#10;bore it to its rest. The vault in which we placed it (and which had&#10;been so long unopened that our torches, half smothered in its oppressive&#10;atmosphere, gave us little opportunity for investigation) was small,&#10;damp, and entirely without means of admission for light; lying, at great&#10;depth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my&#10;own sleeping apartment. It had been used, apparently, in remote feudal&#10;times, for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep, and, in later days, as a&#10;place of deposit for powder, or some other highly combustible substance,&#10;as a portion of its floor, and the whole interior of a long archway&#10;through which we reached it, were carefully sheathed with copper. The&#10;door, of massive iron, had been, also, similarly protected. Its immense&#10;weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its&#10;hinges.&#10;&#10;Having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of&#10;horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin,&#10;and looked upon the face of the tenant. A striking similitude between&#10;the brother and sister now first arrested my attention; and Usher,&#10;divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words from which&#10;I learned that the deceased and himself had been twins, and that&#10;sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between&#10;them. Our glances, however, rested not long upon the dead--for we could&#10;not regard her unawed. The disease which had thus entombed the lady in&#10;the maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictly&#10;cataleptical character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and&#10;the face, and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is&#10;so terrible in death. We replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having&#10;secured the door of iron, made our way, with toil, into the scarcely&#10;less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house.&#10;&#10;And now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable change&#10;came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend. His&#10;ordinary manner had vanished. His ordinary occupations were neglected or&#10;forgotten. He roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal, and&#10;objectless step. The pallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible,&#10;a more ghastly hue--but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone&#10;out. The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a&#10;tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually characterized&#10;his utterance. There were times, indeed, when I thought his unceasingly&#10;agitated mind was laboring with some oppressive secret, to divulge which&#10;he struggled for the necessary courage. At times, again, I was obliged&#10;to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, for I&#10;beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of the&#10;profoundest attention, as if listening to some imaginary sound. It was&#10;no wonder that his condition terrified--that it infected me. I felt&#10;creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences of&#10;his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions.&#10;&#10;It was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the&#10;seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline within the&#10;donjon, that I experienced the full power of such feelings. Sleep came&#10;not near my couch--while the hours waned and waned away. I struggled to&#10;reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me. I endeavored to&#10;believe that much, if not all of what I felt, was due to the bewildering&#10;influence of the gloomy furniture of the room--of the dark and tattered&#10;draperies, which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising&#10;tempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily&#10;about the decorations of the bed. But my efforts were fruitless. An&#10;irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame; and, at length, there&#10;sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm. Shaking&#10;this off with a gasp and a struggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows,&#10;and, peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber,&#10;harkened--I know not why, except that an instinctive spirit prompted&#10;me--to certain low and indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses&#10;of the storm, at long intervals, I knew not whence. Overpowered by an&#10;intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, I threw on&#10;my clothes with haste (for I felt that I should sleep no more during the&#10;night), and endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into&#10;which I had fallen, by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment.&#10;&#10;I had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an&#10;adjoining staircase arrested my attention. I presently recognised it as&#10;that of Usher. In an instant afterward he rapped, with a gentle touch,&#10;at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp. His countenance was, as usual,&#10;cadaverously wan--but, moreover, there was a species of mad hilarity in&#10;his eyes--an evidently restrained _hysteria_ in his whole demeanor. His&#10;air appalled me--but anything was preferable to the solitude which I had&#10;so long endured, and I even welcomed his presence as a relief.&#10;&#10;&quot;And you have not seen it?&quot; he said abruptly, after having stared about&#10;him for some moments in silence--&quot;you have not then seen it?--but, stay!&#10;you shall.&quot; Thus speaking, and having carefully shaded his lamp, he&#10;hurried to one of the casements, and threw it freely open to the storm.&#10;&#10;The impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet.&#10;It was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night, and one&#10;wildly singular in its terror and its beauty. A whirlwind had apparently&#10;collected its force in our vicinity; for there were frequent and violent&#10;alterations in the direction of the wind; and the exceeding density of&#10;the clouds (which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house)&#10;did not prevent our perceiving the life-like velocity with which they&#10;flew careering from all points against each other, without passing&#10;away into the distance. I say that even their exceeding density did&#10;not prevent our perceiving this--yet we had no glimpse of the moon or&#10;stars--nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning. But the&#10;under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor, as well as all&#10;terrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing in the unnatural&#10;light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation&#10;which hung about and enshrouded the mansion.&#10;&#10;&quot;You must not--you shall not behold this!&quot; said I, shudderingly, to&#10;Usher, as I led him, with a gentle violence, from the window to a seat.&#10;&quot;These appearances, which bewilder you, are merely electrical phenomena&#10;not uncommon--or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in&#10;the rank miasma of the tarn. Let us close this casement;--the air is&#10;chilling and dangerous to your frame. Here is one of your favorite&#10;romances. I will read, and you shall listen;--and so we will pass away&#10;this terrible night together.&quot;&#10;&#10;The antique volume which I had taken up was the &quot;Mad Trist&quot; of Sir&#10;Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favorite of Usher's more in sad&#10;jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in its uncouth and&#10;unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty&#10;and spiritual ideality of my friend. It was, however, the only book&#10;immediately at hand; and I indulged a vague hope that the excitement&#10;which now agitated the hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history&#10;of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness&#10;of the folly which I should read. Could I have judged, indeed, by the&#10;wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he harkened, or apparently&#10;harkened, to the words of the tale, I might well have congratulated&#10;myself upon the success of my design.&#10;&#10;I had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where Ethelred,&#10;the hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for peaceable admission&#10;into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an entrance by&#10;force. Here, it will be remembered, the words of the narrative run thus:&#10;&#10;&quot;And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was now&#10;mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had&#10;drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit, who, in sooth,&#10;was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain upon his&#10;shoulders, and fearing the rising of the tempest, uplifted his mace&#10;outright, and, with blows, made quickly room in the plankings of the&#10;door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling therewith sturdily, he so&#10;cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and&#10;hollow-sounding wood alarummed and reverberated throughout the forest.&quot;&#10;&#10;At the termination of this sentence I started, and for a moment, paused;&#10;for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my excited&#10;fancy had deceived me)--it appeared to me that, from some very remote&#10;portion of the mansion, there came, indistinctly, to my ears, what might&#10;have been, in its exact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled&#10;and dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which&#10;Sir Launcelot had so particularly described. It was, beyond doubt,&#10;the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid the&#10;rattling of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary commingled&#10;noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in itself, had nothing,&#10;surely, which should have interested or disturbed me. I continued the&#10;story:&#10;&#10;&quot;But the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door, was sore&#10;enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit; but,&#10;in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanor, and&#10;of a fiery tongue, which sate in guard before a palace of gold, with a&#10;floor of silver; and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass&#10;with this legend enwritten--&#10;&#10;     Who entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin;&#10;     Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win;&#10;&#10;And Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the dragon,&#10;which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a shriek so&#10;horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that Ethelred had fain to&#10;close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it, the like&#10;whereof was never before heard.&quot;&#10;&#10;Here again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild&#10;amazement--for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this instance,&#10;I did actually hear (although from what direction it proceeded I&#10;found it impossible to say) a low and apparently distant, but harsh,&#10;protracted, and most unusual screaming or grating sound--the exact&#10;counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon's&#10;unnatural shriek as described by the romancer.&#10;&#10;Oppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of this second and&#10;most extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting sensations,&#10;in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant, I still retained&#10;sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, the&#10;sensitive nervousness of my companion. I was by no means certain that&#10;he had noticed the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange&#10;alteration had, during the last few minutes, taken place in his&#10;demeanor. From a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought&#10;round his chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber;&#10;and thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I saw&#10;that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly. His head had&#10;dropped upon his breast--yet I knew that he was not asleep, from the&#10;wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a glance of it in profile.&#10;The motion of his body, too, was at variance with this idea--for he&#10;rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway.&#10;Having rapidly taken notice of all this, I resumed the narrative of Sir&#10;Launcelot, which thus proceeded:&#10;&#10;&quot;And now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of the&#10;dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the breaking up&#10;of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the carcass from out of&#10;the way before him, and approached valorously over the silver pavement&#10;of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall; which in sooth&#10;tarried not for his full coming, but feel down at his feet upon the&#10;silver floor, with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound.&quot;&#10;&#10;No sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than--as if a shield&#10;of brass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor of&#10;silver--I became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic, and clangorous,&#10;yet apparently muffled reverberation. Completely unnerved, I leaped to&#10;my feet; but the measured rocking movement of Usher was undisturbed. I&#10;rushed to the chair in which he sat. His eyes were bent fixedly&#10;before him, and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony&#10;rigidity. But, as I placed my hand upon his shoulder, there came a&#10;strong shudder over his whole person; a sickly smile quivered about his&#10;lips; and I saw that he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur,&#10;as if unconscious of my presence. Bending closely over him, I at length&#10;drank in the hideous import of his words.&#10;&#10;&quot;Not hear it?--yes, I hear it, and _have_ heard it.&#10;Long--long--long--many minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard&#10;it--yet I dared not--oh, pity me, miserable wretch that I am!--I dared&#10;not--I _dared_ not speak! _We have put her living in the tomb!_ Said I&#10;not that my senses were acute? I _now_ tell you that I heard her first&#10;feeble movements in the hollow coffin. I heard them--many,&#10;many days ago--yet I dared not--_I dared not speak!_ And&#10;now--to-night--Ethelred--ha! ha!--the breaking of the hermit's door,&#10;and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangor of the shield!--say,&#10;rather, the rending of her coffin, and the grating of the iron hinges of&#10;her prison, and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault!&#10;Oh whither shall I fly? Will she not be here anon? Is she not hurrying&#10;to upbraid me for my haste? Have I not heard her footstep on the stair?&#10;Do I not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart?&#10;Madman!&quot;--here he sprang furiously to his feet, and shrieked out his&#10;syllables, as if in the effort he were giving up his soul--&quot;_Madman!&#10;I tell you that she now stands without the door!_&quot;&#10;&#10;As if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found&#10;the potency of a spell--the huge antique pannels to which the speaker&#10;pointed, threw slowly back, upon the instant, their ponderous and ebony&#10;jaws. It was the work of the rushing gust--but then without those doors&#10;there _did_ stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady Madeline&#10;of Usher. There was blood upon her white robes, and the evidence of some&#10;bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame. For a moment&#10;she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold--then,&#10;with a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon the person of her&#10;brother, and in her violent and now final death-agonies, bore him to the&#10;floor a corpse, and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated.&#10;&#10;From that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast. The storm&#10;was still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself crossing the old&#10;causeway. Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, and I turned&#10;to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued; for the vast house&#10;and its shadows were alone behind me. The radiance was that of the full,&#10;setting, and blood-red moon, which now shone vividly through that once&#10;barely-discernible fissure, of which I have before spoken as extending&#10;from the roof of the building, in a zigzag direction, to the base. While&#10;I gazed, this fissure rapidly widened--there came a fierce breath of&#10;the whirlwind--the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my&#10;sight--my brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushing asunder--there&#10;was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand&#10;waters--and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and&#10;silently over the fragments of the &quot;_House of Usher_.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;SILENCE--A FABLE&#10;&#10;     ALCMAN. The mountain pinnacles slumber; valleys, crags and&#10;     caves are silent.&#10;&#10;&quot;LISTEN to me,&quot; said the Demon as he placed his hand upon my head. &quot;The&#10;region of which I speak is a dreary region in Libya, by the borders of&#10;the river Zaire. And there is no quiet there, nor silence.&#10;&#10;&quot;The waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue; and they flow&#10;not onwards to the sea, but palpitate forever and forever beneath the&#10;red eye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive motion. For many&#10;miles on either side of the river's oozy bed is a pale desert of&#10;gigantic water-lilies. They sigh one unto the other in that solitude,&#10;and stretch towards the heaven their long and ghastly necks, and nod to&#10;and fro their everlasting heads. And there is an indistinct murmur which&#10;cometh out from among them like the rushing of subterrene water. And&#10;they sigh one unto the other.&#10;&#10;&quot;But there is a boundary to their realm--the boundary of the dark,&#10;horrible, lofty forest. There, like the waves about the Hebrides, the&#10;low underwood is agitated continually. But there is no wind throughout&#10;the heaven. And the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither and&#10;thither with a crashing and mighty sound. And from their high summits,&#10;one by one, drop everlasting dews. And at the roots strange poisonous&#10;flowers lie writhing in perturbed slumber. And overhead, with a rustling&#10;and loud noise, the gray clouds rush westwardly forever, until they&#10;roll, a cataract, over the fiery wall of the horizon. But there is no&#10;wind throughout the heaven. And by the shores of the river Zaire there&#10;is neither quiet nor silence.&#10;&#10;&quot;It was night, and the rain fell; and falling, it was rain, but, having&#10;fallen, it was blood. And I stood in the morass among the tall and the&#10;rain fell upon my head--and the lilies sighed one unto the other in the&#10;solemnity of their desolation.&#10;&#10;&quot;And, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist, and was&#10;crimson in color. And mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which stood&#10;by the shore of the river, and was lighted by the light of the moon. And&#10;the rock was gray, and ghastly, and tall,--and the rock was gray. Upon&#10;its front were characters engraven in the stone; and I walked through&#10;the morass of water-lilies, until I came close unto the shore, that I&#10;might read the characters upon the stone. But I could not decypher them.&#10;And I was going back into the morass, when the moon shone with a&#10;fuller red, and I turned and looked again upon the rock, and upon the&#10;characters;--and the characters were DESOLATION.&#10;&#10;&quot;And I looked upwards, and there stood a man upon the summit of the&#10;rock; and I hid myself among the water-lilies that I might discover the&#10;actions of the man. And the man was tall and stately in form, and was&#10;wrapped up from his shoulders to his feet in the toga of old Rome. And&#10;the outlines of his figure were indistinct--but his features were the&#10;features of a deity; for the mantle of the night, and of the mist, and&#10;of the moon, and of the dew, had left uncovered the features of his&#10;face. And his brow was lofty with thought, and his eye wild with care;&#10;and, in the few furrows upon his cheek I read the fables of sorrow, and&#10;weariness, and disgust with mankind, and a longing after solitude.&#10;&#10;&quot;And the man sat upon the rock, and leaned his head upon his hand, and&#10;looked out upon the desolation. He looked down into the low unquiet&#10;shrubbery, and up into the tall primeval trees, and up higher at the&#10;rustling heaven, and into the crimson moon. And I lay close within&#10;shelter of the lilies, and observed the actions of the man. And the&#10;man trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned, and he sat upon the&#10;rock.&#10;&#10;&quot;And the man turned his attention from the heaven, and looked out upon&#10;the dreary river Zaire, and upon the yellow ghastly waters, and upon the&#10;pale legions of the water-lilies. And the man listened to the sighs of&#10;the water-lilies, and to the murmur that came up from among them. And I&#10;lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And the&#10;man trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned and he sat upon the&#10;rock.&#10;&#10;&quot;Then I went down into the recesses of the morass, and waded afar in&#10;among the wilderness of the lilies, and called unto the hippopotami&#10;which dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the morass. And the&#10;hippopotami heard my call, and came, with the behemoth, unto the foot&#10;of the rock, and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon. And I lay&#10;close within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And the man&#10;trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.&#10;&#10;&quot;Then I cursed the elements with the curse of tumult; and a frightful&#10;tempest gathered in the heaven where, before, there had been no wind.&#10;And the heaven became livid with the violence of the tempest--and the&#10;rain beat upon the head of the man--and the floods of the river came&#10;down--and the river was tormented into foam--and the water-lilies&#10;shrieked within their beds--and the forest crumbled before the wind--and&#10;the thunder rolled--and the lightning fell--and the rock rocked to its&#10;foundation. And I lay close within my covert and observed the actions of&#10;the man. And the man trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned and&#10;he sat upon the rock.&#10;&#10;&quot;Then I grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, the river,&#10;and the lilies, and the wind, and the forest, and the heaven, and the&#10;thunder, and the sighs of the water-lilies. And they became accursed,&#10;and were still. And the moon ceased to totter up its pathway to&#10;heaven--and the thunder died away--and the lightning did not flash--and&#10;the clouds hung motionless--and the waters sunk to their level and&#10;remained--and the trees ceased to rock--and the water-lilies sighed no&#10;more--and the murmur was heard no longer from among them, nor any shadow&#10;of sound throughout the vast illimitable desert. And I looked upon the&#10;characters of the rock, and they were changed;--and the characters were&#10;SILENCE.&#10;&#10;&quot;And mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man, and his countenance&#10;was wan with terror. And, hurriedly, he raised his head from his hand,&#10;and stood forth upon the rock and listened. But there was no voice&#10;throughout the vast illimitable desert, and the characters upon the rock&#10;were SILENCE. And the man shuddered, and turned his face away, and fled&#10;afar off, in haste, so that I beheld him no more.&quot;&#10;&#10;Now there are fine tales in the volumes of the Magi--in the iron-bound,&#10;melancholy volumes of the Magi. Therein, I say, are glorious histories&#10;of the Heaven, and of the Earth, and of the mighty sea--and of the Genii&#10;that over-ruled the sea, and the earth, and the lofty heaven. There was&#10;much lore too in the sayings which were said by the Sybils; and holy,&#10;holy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around&#10;Dodona--but, as Allah liveth, that fable which the Demon told me as&#10;he sat by my side in the shadow of the tomb, I hold to be the most&#10;wonderful of all! And as the Demon made an end of his story, he fell&#10;back within the cavity of the tomb and laughed. And I could not laugh&#10;with the Demon, and he cursed me because I could not laugh. And the lynx&#10;which dwelleth forever in the tomb, came out therefrom, and lay down at&#10;the feet of the Demon, and looked at him steadily in the face.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH.&#10;&#10;THE &quot;Red Death&quot; had long devastated the country. No pestilence had ever&#10;been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and its seal--the&#10;redness and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden&#10;dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution. The&#10;scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim,&#10;were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy&#10;of his fellow-men. And the whole seizure, progress and termination of&#10;the disease, were the incidents of half an hour.&#10;&#10;But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious. When his&#10;dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousand&#10;hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of&#10;his court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his&#10;castellated abbeys. This was an extensive and magnificent structure, the&#10;creation of the prince's own eccentric yet august taste. A strong and&#10;lofty wall girdled it in. This wall had gates of iron. The courtiers,&#10;having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts.&#10;They resolved to leave means neither of ingress or egress to the sudden&#10;impulses of despair or of frenzy from within. The abbey was amply&#10;provisioned. With such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to&#10;contagion. The external world could take care of itself. In the meantime&#10;it was folly to grieve, or to think. The prince had provided all the&#10;appliances of pleasure. There were buffoons, there were improvisatori,&#10;there were ballet-dancers, there were musicians, there was Beauty,&#10;there was wine. All these and security were within. Without was the &quot;Red&#10;Death.&quot;&#10;&#10;It was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion,&#10;and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that the Prince&#10;Prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most&#10;unusual magnificence.&#10;&#10;It was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. But first let me tell of the&#10;rooms in which it was held. There were seven--an imperial suite. In many&#10;palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista, while the&#10;folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so that&#10;the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded. Here the case was&#10;very different; as might have been expected from the duke's love of the&#10;bizarre. The apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision&#10;embraced but little more than one at a time. There was a sharp turn at&#10;every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect. To the&#10;right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic&#10;window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of&#10;the suite. These windows were of stained glass whose color varied in&#10;accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber&#10;into which it opened. That at the eastern extremity was hung, for&#10;example, in blue--and vividly blue were its windows. The second chamber&#10;was purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were&#10;purple. The third was green throughout, and so were the casements. The&#10;fourth was furnished and lighted with orange--the fifth with white--the&#10;sixth with violet. The seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black&#10;velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls,&#10;falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue. But&#10;in this chamber only, the color of the windows failed to correspond with&#10;the decorations. The panes here were scarlet--a deep blood color. Now in&#10;no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid&#10;the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or&#10;depended from the roof. There was no light of any kind emanating from&#10;lamp or candle within the suite of chambers. But in the corridors&#10;that followed the suite, there stood, opposite to each window, a heavy&#10;tripod, bearing a brazier of fire that projected its rays through the&#10;tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room. And thus were produced&#10;a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances. But in the western or&#10;black chamber the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark&#10;hangings through the blood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the extreme, and&#10;produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered,&#10;that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its&#10;precincts at all.&#10;&#10;It was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the western&#10;wall, a gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to and fro with a&#10;dull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand made the circuit&#10;of the face, and the hour was to be stricken, there came from the&#10;brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and&#10;exceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that, at&#10;each lapse of an hour, the musicians of the orchestra were constrained&#10;to pause, momentarily, in their performance, to hearken to the sound;&#10;and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was a&#10;brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the chimes of the&#10;clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew pale, and the&#10;more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in&#10;confused reverie or meditation. But when the echoes had fully ceased,&#10;a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians looked at&#10;each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly, and made&#10;whispering vows, each to the other, that the next chiming of the clock&#10;should produce in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of&#10;sixty minutes, (which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of&#10;the Time that flies,) there came yet another chiming of the clock,&#10;and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as&#10;before.&#10;&#10;But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel.&#10;The tastes of the duke were peculiar. He had a fine eye for colors and&#10;effects. He disregarded the decora of mere fashion. His plans were bold&#10;and fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre. There are&#10;some who would have thought him mad. His followers felt that he was not.&#10;It was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was&#10;not.&#10;&#10;He had directed, in great part, the moveable embellishments of the seven&#10;chambers, upon occasion of this great fete; and it was his own guiding&#10;taste which had given character to the masqueraders. Be sure they&#10;were grotesque. There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and&#10;phantasm--much of what has been since seen in &quot;Hernani.&quot; There were&#10;arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments. There were&#10;delirious fancies such as the madman fashions. There was much of the&#10;beautiful, much of the wanton, much of the bizarre, something of the&#10;terrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust.&#10;To and fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of&#10;dreams. And these--the dreams--writhed in and about, taking hue from the&#10;rooms, and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo&#10;of their steps. And, anon, there strikes the ebony clock which stands in&#10;the hall of the velvet. And then, for a moment, all is still, and all is&#10;silent save the voice of the clock. The dreams are stiff-frozen as they&#10;stand. But the echoes of the chime die away--they have endured but an&#10;instant--and a light, half-subdued laughter floats after them as they&#10;depart. And now again the music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe&#10;to and fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the many-tinted&#10;windows through which stream the rays from the tripods. But to the&#10;chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven, there are now none of&#10;the maskers who venture; for the night is waning away; and there flows a&#10;ruddier light through the blood-colored panes; and the blackness of the&#10;sable drapery appals; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet,&#10;there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly&#10;emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulge in the more&#10;remote gaieties of the other apartments.&#10;&#10;But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat&#10;feverishly the heart of life. And the revel went whirlingly on, until at&#10;length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock. And then&#10;the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the waltzers&#10;were quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before.&#10;But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the&#10;clock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, with&#10;more of time, into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who&#10;revelled. And thus, too, it happened, perhaps, that before the last&#10;echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were many&#10;individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the&#10;presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no&#10;single individual before. And the rumor of this new presence having&#10;spread itself whisperingly around, there arose at length from the&#10;whole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of disapprobation and&#10;surprise--then, finally, of terror, of horror, and of disgust.&#10;&#10;In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well be&#10;supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation.&#10;In truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly unlimited; but&#10;the figure in question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the bounds&#10;of even the prince's indefinite decorum. There are chords in the hearts&#10;of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion. Even with&#10;the utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there are&#10;matters of which no jest can be made. The whole company, indeed, seemed&#10;now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger&#10;neither wit nor propriety existed. The figure was tall and gaunt, and&#10;shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave. The&#10;mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the&#10;countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have&#10;had difficulty in detecting the cheat. And yet all this might have been&#10;endured, if not approved, by the mad revellers around. But the mummer&#10;had gone so far as to assume the type of the Red Death. His vesture was&#10;dabbled in blood--and his broad brow, with all the features of the face,&#10;was besprinkled with the scarlet horror.&#10;&#10;When the eyes of Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image (which&#10;with a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its role,&#10;stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be convulsed, in&#10;the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste;&#10;but, in the next, his brow reddened with rage.&#10;&#10;&quot;Who dares?&quot; he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near&#10;him--&quot;who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery? Seize him and&#10;unmask him--that we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise, from the&#10;battlements!&quot;&#10;&#10;It was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince Prospero&#10;as he uttered these words. They rang throughout the seven rooms loudly&#10;and clearly--for the prince was a bold and robust man, and the music had&#10;become hushed at the waving of his hand.&#10;&#10;It was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of pale&#10;courtiers by his side. At first, as he spoke, there was a slight rushing&#10;movement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who at the&#10;moment was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and stately step,&#10;made closer approach to the speaker. But from a certain nameless awe&#10;with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole&#10;party, there were found none who put forth hand to seize him; so that,&#10;unimpeded, he passed within a yard of the prince's person; and, while&#10;the vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of&#10;the rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the&#10;same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the&#10;first, through the blue chamber to the purple--through the purple to&#10;the green--through the green to the orange--through this again to the&#10;white--and even thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been&#10;made to arrest him. It was then, however, that the Prince Prospero,&#10;maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice, rushed&#10;hurriedly through the six chambers, while none followed him on account&#10;of a deadly terror that had seized upon all. He bore aloft a drawn&#10;dagger, and had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three or&#10;four feet of the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained the&#10;extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted his&#10;pursuer. There was a sharp cry--and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the&#10;sable carpet, upon which, instantly afterwards, fell prostrate in death&#10;the Prince Prospero. Then, summoning the wild courage of despair,&#10;a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black&#10;apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and&#10;motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable&#10;horror at finding the grave-cerements and corpse-like mask which they&#10;handled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form.&#10;&#10;And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death. He had come&#10;like a thief in the night. And one by one dropped the revellers in the&#10;blood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died each in the despairing&#10;posture of his fall. And the life of the ebony clock went out with&#10;that of the last of the gay. And the flames of the tripods expired. And&#10;Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO.&#10;&#10;THE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could; but&#10;when he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge. You, who so well know the&#10;nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance to&#10;a threat. _At length_ I would be avenged; this was a point definitively&#10;settled--but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved,&#10;precluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish, but punish with&#10;impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its&#10;redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make&#10;himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.&#10;&#10;It must be understood, that neither by word nor deed had I given&#10;Fortunato cause to doubt my good will. I continued, as was my wont, to&#10;smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile _now_ was at&#10;the thought of his immolation.&#10;&#10;He had a weak point--this Fortunato--although in other regards he was&#10;a man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on his&#10;connoisseurship in wine. Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit.&#10;For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and&#10;opportunity--to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian&#10;_millionaires_. In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen,&#10;was a quack--but in the matter of old wines he was sincere. In this&#10;respect I did not differ from him materially: I was skilful in the&#10;Italian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could.&#10;&#10;It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the&#10;carnival season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with&#10;excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man wore motley. He&#10;had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was surmounted&#10;by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him, that I&#10;thought I should never have done wringing his hand.&#10;&#10;I said to him--&quot;My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How remarkably&#10;well you are looking to-day! But I have received a pipe of what passes&#10;for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How?&quot; said he. &quot;Amontillado? A pipe? Impossible! And in the middle of&#10;the carnival!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have my doubts,&quot; I replied; &quot;and I was silly enough to pay the full&#10;Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to&#10;be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Amontillado!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have my doubts.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Amontillado!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And I must satisfy them.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Amontillado!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi. If any one has a&#10;critical turn, it is he. He will tell me--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Luchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your&#10;own.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Come, let us go.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Whither?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;To your vaults.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature. I perceive you&#10;have an engagement. Luchesi--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have no engagement;--come.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with which&#10;I perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are insufferably damp. They are&#10;encrusted with nitre.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! You&#10;have been imposed upon. And as for Luchesi, he cannot distinguish Sherry&#10;from Amontillado.&quot;&#10;&#10;Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm. Putting on a mask&#10;of black silk, and drawing a _roquelaire_ closely about my person, I&#10;suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.&#10;&#10;There were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in&#10;honor of the time. I had told them that I should not return until the&#10;morning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house.&#10;These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate&#10;disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.&#10;&#10;I took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato,&#10;bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into&#10;the vaults. I passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting him&#10;to be cautious as he followed. We came at length to the foot of the&#10;descent, and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the&#10;Montresors.&#10;&#10;The gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingled&#10;as he strode.&#10;&#10;&quot;The pipe,&quot; said he.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is farther on,&quot; said I; &quot;but observe the white web-work which gleams&#10;from these cavern walls.&quot;&#10;&#10;He turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that&#10;distilled the rheum of intoxication.&#10;&#10;&quot;Nitre?&quot; he asked, at length.&#10;&#10;&quot;Nitre,&quot; I replied. &quot;How long have you had that cough?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh!&#10;ugh! ugh!&quot;&#10;&#10;My poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is nothing,&quot; he said, at last.&#10;&#10;&quot;Come,&quot; I said, with decision, &quot;we will go back; your health is&#10;precious. You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as&#10;once I was. You are a man to be missed. For me it is no matter. We will&#10;go back; you will be ill, and I cannot be responsible. Besides, there is&#10;Luchesi--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Enough,&quot; he said; &quot;the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill me. I&#10;shall not die of a cough.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;True--true,&quot; I replied; &quot;and, indeed, I had no intention of alarming&#10;you unnecessarily--but you should use all proper caution. A draught of&#10;this Medoc will defend us from the damps.&quot;&#10;&#10;Here I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row of&#10;its fellows that lay upon the mould.&#10;&#10;&quot;Drink,&quot; I said, presenting him the wine.&#10;&#10;He raised it to his lips with a leer. He paused and nodded to me&#10;familiarly, while his bells jingled.&#10;&#10;&quot;I drink,&quot; he said, &quot;to the buried that repose around us.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And I to your long life.&quot;&#10;&#10;He again took my arm, and we proceeded.&#10;&#10;&quot;These vaults,&quot; he said, &quot;are extensive.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The Montresors,&quot; I replied, &quot;were a great and numerous family.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I forget your arms.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent&#10;rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And the motto?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;_Nemo me impune lacessit_.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Good!&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;The wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. My own fancy grew&#10;warm with the Medoc. We had passed through walls of piled bones, with&#10;casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of the&#10;catacombs. I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize Fortunato&#10;by an arm above the elbow.&#10;&#10;&quot;The nitre!&quot; I said: &quot;see, it increases. It hangs like moss upon the&#10;vaults. We are below the river's bed. The drops of moisture trickle&#10;among the bones. Come, we will go back ere it is too late. Your cough--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is nothing,&quot; he said; &quot;let us go on. But first, another draught of&#10;the Medoc.&quot;&#10;&#10;I broke and reached him a flagon of De GrÃ¢ve. He emptied it at a breath.&#10;His eyes flashed with a fierce light. He laughed and threw the bottle&#10;upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand.&#10;&#10;I looked at him in surprise. He repeated the movement--a grotesque one.&#10;&#10;&quot;You do not comprehend?&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;&quot;Not I,&quot; I replied.&#10;&#10;&quot;Then you are not of the brotherhood.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You are not of the masons.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; I said, &quot;yes, yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You? Impossible! A mason?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A mason,&quot; I replied.&#10;&#10;&quot;A sign,&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is this,&quot; I answered, producing a trowel from beneath the folds of&#10;my _roquelaire_.&#10;&#10;&quot;You jest,&quot; he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. &quot;But let us proceed to&#10;the Amontillado.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Be it so,&quot; I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak, and again&#10;offering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily. We continued our route&#10;in search of the Amontillado. We passed through a range of low arches,&#10;descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in&#10;which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than&#10;flame.&#10;&#10;At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less&#10;spacious. Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the&#10;vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris. Three&#10;sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner. From&#10;the fourth the bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon&#10;the earth, forming at one point a mound of some size. Within the wall&#10;thus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we perceived a still&#10;interior recess, in depth about four feet, in width three, in height&#10;six or seven. It seemed to have been constructed for no especial use&#10;in itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal&#10;supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of their&#10;circumscribing walls of solid granite.&#10;&#10;It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavored to&#10;pry into the depths of the recess. Its termination the feeble light did&#10;not enable us to see.&#10;&#10;&quot;Proceed,&quot; I said; &quot;herein is the Amontillado. As for Luchesi--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He is an ignoramus,&quot; interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily&#10;forward, while I followed immediately at his heels. In an instant he had&#10;reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrested&#10;by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered. A moment more and I had fettered&#10;him to the granite. In its surface were two iron staples, distant from&#10;each other about two feet, horizontally. From one of these depended&#10;a short chain, from the other a padlock. Throwing the links about his&#10;waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it. He was too&#10;much astounded to resist. Withdrawing the key I stepped back from the&#10;recess.&#10;&#10;&quot;Pass your hand,&quot; I said, &quot;over the wall; you cannot help feeling the&#10;nitre. Indeed it is _very_ damp. Once more let me _implore_ you to&#10;return. No? Then I must positively leave you. But I must first render&#10;you all the little attentions in my power.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The Amontillado!&quot; ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his&#10;astonishment.&#10;&#10;&quot;True,&quot; I replied; &quot;the Amontillado.&quot;&#10;&#10;As I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which I&#10;have before spoken. Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity of&#10;building stone and mortar. With these materials and with the aid of my&#10;trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.&#10;&#10;I had scarcely laid the first tier of my masonry when I discovered&#10;that the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off. The&#10;earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth&#10;of the recess. It was _not_ the cry of a drunken man. There was then a&#10;long and obstinate silence. I laid the second tier, and the third, and&#10;the fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain. The&#10;noise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to&#10;it with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labors and sat down upon the&#10;bones. When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel, and&#10;finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh&#10;tier. The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast. I again&#10;paused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a few&#10;feeble rays upon the figure within.&#10;&#10;A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the&#10;throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back. For a&#10;brief moment I hesitated--I trembled. Unsheathing my rapier, I began to&#10;grope with it about the recess: but the thought of an instant reassured&#10;me. I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt&#10;satisfied. I reapproached the wall. I replied to the yells of him&#10;who clamored. I re-echoed--I aided--I surpassed them in volume and in&#10;strength. I did this, and the clamorer grew still.&#10;&#10;It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. I had completed&#10;the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier. I had finished a portion&#10;of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone to&#10;be fitted and plastered in. I struggled with its weight; I placed it&#10;partially in its destined position. But now there came from out the&#10;niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head. It was succeeded&#10;by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognising as that of the&#10;noble Fortunato. The voice said--&#10;&#10;&quot;Ha! ha! ha!--he! he!--a very good joke indeed--an excellent jest. We&#10;will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo--he! he! he!--over&#10;our wine--he! he! he!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The Amontillado!&quot; I said.&#10;&#10;&quot;He! he! he!--he! he! he!--yes, the Amontillado. But is it not getting&#10;late? Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the Lady Fortunato&#10;and the rest? Let us be gone.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; I said, &quot;let us be gone.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;_For the love of God, Montressor!_&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; I said, &quot;for the love of God!&quot;&#10;&#10;But to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply. I grew impatient. I&#10;called aloud--&#10;&#10;&quot;Fortunato!&quot;&#10;&#10;No answer. I called again--&#10;&#10;&quot;Fortunato!&quot;&#10;&#10;No answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let&#10;it fall within. There came forth in return only a jingling of the bells.&#10;My heart grew sick--on account of the dampness of the catacombs. I&#10;hastened to make an end of my labor. I forced the last stone into its&#10;position; I plastered it up. Against the new masonry I re-erected the&#10;old rampart of bones. For the half of a century no mortal has disturbed&#10;them. _In pace requiescat!_&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;THE IMP OF THE PERVERSE&#10;&#10;IN THE consideration of the faculties and impulses--of the prima mobilia&#10;of the human soul, the phrenologists have failed to make room for a&#10;propensity which, although obviously existing as a radical, primitive,&#10;irreducible sentiment, has been equally overlooked by all the moralists&#10;who have preceded them. In the pure arrogance of the reason, we have&#10;all overlooked it. We have suffered its existence to escape our senses,&#10;solely through want of belief--of faith;--whether it be faith in&#10;Revelation, or faith in the Kabbala. The idea of it has never occurred&#10;to us, simply because of its supererogation. We saw no need of the&#10;impulse--for the propensity. We could not perceive its necessity. We&#10;could not understand, that is to say, we could not have understood, had&#10;the notion of this primum mobile ever obtruded itself;--we could not&#10;have understood in what manner it might be made to further the objects&#10;of humanity, either temporal or eternal. It cannot be denied that&#10;phrenology and, in great measure, all metaphysicianism have been&#10;concocted a priori. The intellectual or logical man, rather than the&#10;understanding or observant man, set himself to imagine designs--to&#10;dictate purposes to God. Having thus fathomed, to his satisfaction, the&#10;intentions of Jehovah, out of these intentions he built his innumerable&#10;systems of mind. In the matter of phrenology, for example, we first&#10;determined, naturally enough, that it was the design of the Deity that&#10;man should eat. We then assigned to man an organ of alimentiveness,&#10;and this organ is the scourge with which the Deity compels man, will-I&#10;nill-I, into eating. Secondly, having settled it to be God's will that&#10;man should continue his species, we discovered an organ of amativeness,&#10;forthwith. And so with combativeness, with ideality, with causality,&#10;with constructiveness,--so, in short, with every organ, whether&#10;representing a propensity, a moral sentiment, or a faculty of the pure&#10;intellect. And in these arrangements of the Principia of human action,&#10;the Spurzheimites, whether right or wrong, in part, or upon the whole,&#10;have but followed, in principle, the footsteps of their predecessors:&#10;deducing and establishing every thing from the preconceived destiny of&#10;man, and upon the ground of the objects of his Creator.&#10;&#10;It would have been wiser, it would have been safer, to classify (if&#10;classify we must) upon the basis of what man usually or occasionally&#10;did, and was always occasionally doing, rather than upon the basis of&#10;what we took it for granted the Deity intended him to do. If we cannot&#10;comprehend God in his visible works, how then in his inconceivable&#10;thoughts, that call the works into being? If we cannot understand him in&#10;his objective creatures, how then in his substantive moods and phases of&#10;creation?&#10;&#10;Induction, a posteriori, would have brought phrenology to admit, as an&#10;innate and primitive principle of human action, a paradoxical something,&#10;which we may call perverseness, for want of a more characteristic term.&#10;In the sense I intend, it is, in fact, a mobile without motive, a motive&#10;not motivirt. Through its promptings we act without comprehensible&#10;object; or, if this shall be understood as a contradiction in terms, we&#10;may so far modify the proposition as to say, that through its promptings&#10;we act, for the reason that we should not. In theory, no reason can be&#10;more unreasonable, but, in fact, there is none more strong. With certain&#10;minds, under certain conditions, it becomes absolutely irresistible. I&#10;am not more certain that I breathe, than that the assurance of the wrong&#10;or error of any action is often the one unconquerable force which impels&#10;us, and alone impels us to its prosecution. Nor will this overwhelming&#10;tendency to do wrong for the wrong's sake, admit of analysis, or&#10;resolution into ulterior elements. It is a radical, a primitive&#10;impulse-elementary. It will be said, I am aware, that when we persist in&#10;acts because we feel we should not persist in them, our conduct is but a&#10;modification of that which ordinarily springs from the combativeness&#10;of phrenology. But a glance will show the fallacy of this idea. The&#10;phrenological combativeness has for its essence, the necessity of&#10;self-defence. It is our safeguard against injury. Its principle regards&#10;our well-being; and thus the desire to be well is excited simultaneously&#10;with its development. It follows, that the desire to be well must&#10;be excited simultaneously with any principle which shall be merely a&#10;modification of combativeness, but in the case of that something which I&#10;term perverseness, the desire to be well is not only not aroused, but a&#10;strongly antagonistical sentiment exists.&#10;&#10;An appeal to one's own heart is, after all, the best reply to the&#10;sophistry just noticed. No one who trustingly consults and thoroughly&#10;questions his own soul, will be disposed to deny the entire radicalness&#10;of the propensity in question. It is not more incomprehensible than&#10;distinctive. There lives no man who at some period has not been&#10;tormented, for example, by an earnest desire to tantalize a listener by&#10;circumlocution. The speaker is aware that he displeases; he has every&#10;intention to please, he is usually curt, precise, and clear, the most&#10;laconic and luminous language is struggling for utterance upon his&#10;tongue, it is only with difficulty that he restrains himself from giving&#10;it flow; he dreads and deprecates the anger of him whom he addresses;&#10;yet, the thought strikes him, that by certain involutions and&#10;parentheses this anger may be engendered. That single thought is enough.&#10;The impulse increases to a wish, the wish to a desire, the desire to&#10;an uncontrollable longing, and the longing (to the deep regret and&#10;mortification of the speaker, and in defiance of all consequences) is&#10;indulged.&#10;&#10;We have a task before us which must be speedily performed. We know that&#10;it will be ruinous to make delay. The most important crisis of our life&#10;calls, trumpet-tongued, for immediate energy and action. We glow, we are&#10;consumed with eagerness to commence the work, with the anticipation of&#10;whose glorious result our whole souls are on fire. It must, it shall be&#10;undertaken to-day, and yet we put it off until to-morrow, and why?&#10;There is no answer, except that we feel perverse, using the word with&#10;no comprehension of the principle. To-morrow arrives, and with it a more&#10;impatient anxiety to do our duty, but with this very increase of anxiety&#10;arrives, also, a nameless, a positively fearful, because unfathomable,&#10;craving for delay. This craving gathers strength as the moments fly.&#10;The last hour for action is at hand. We tremble with the violence of&#10;the conflict within us,--of the definite with the indefinite--of the&#10;substance with the shadow. But, if the contest have proceeded thus&#10;far, it is the shadow which prevails,--we struggle in vain. The clock&#10;strikes, and is the knell of our welfare. At the same time, it is&#10;the chanticleer--note to the ghost that has so long overawed us. It&#10;flies--it disappears--we are free. The old energy returns. We will labor&#10;now. Alas, it is too late!&#10;&#10;We stand upon the brink of a precipice. We peer into the abyss--we&#10;grow sick and dizzy. Our first impulse is to shrink from the danger.&#10;Unaccountably we remain. By slow degrees our sickness and dizziness and&#10;horror become merged in a cloud of unnamable feeling. By gradations,&#10;still more imperceptible, this cloud assumes shape, as did the vapor&#10;from the bottle out of which arose the genius in the Arabian Nights.&#10;But out of this our cloud upon the precipice's edge, there grows into&#10;palpability, a shape, far more terrible than any genius or any demon&#10;of a tale, and yet it is but a thought, although a fearful one, and one&#10;which chills the very marrow of our bones with the fierceness of the&#10;delight of its horror. It is merely the idea of what would be our&#10;sensations during the sweeping precipitancy of a fall from such a&#10;height. And this fall--this rushing annihilation--for the very reason&#10;that it involves that one most ghastly and loathsome of all the most&#10;ghastly and loathsome images of death and suffering which have ever&#10;presented themselves to our imagination--for this very cause do we now&#10;the most vividly desire it. And because our reason violently deters us&#10;from the brink, therefore do we the most impetuously approach it. There&#10;is no passion in nature so demoniacally impatient, as that of him who,&#10;shuddering upon the edge of a precipice, thus meditates a Plunge. To&#10;indulge, for a moment, in any attempt at thought, is to be inevitably&#10;lost; for reflection but urges us to forbear, and therefore it is, I&#10;say, that we cannot. If there be no friendly arm to check us, or if we&#10;fail in a sudden effort to prostrate ourselves backward from the abyss,&#10;we plunge, and are destroyed.&#10;&#10;Examine these similar actions as we will, we shall find them resulting&#10;solely from the spirit of the Perverse. We perpetrate them because we&#10;feel that we should not. Beyond or behind this there is no intelligible&#10;principle; and we might, indeed, deem this perverseness a direct&#10;instigation of the Arch-Fiend, were it not occasionally known to operate&#10;in furtherance of good.&#10;&#10;I have said thus much, that in some measure I may answer your question,&#10;that I may explain to you why I am here, that I may assign to you&#10;something that shall have at least the faint aspect of a cause for my&#10;wearing these fetters, and for my tenanting this cell of the condemned.&#10;Had I not been thus prolix, you might either have misunderstood me&#10;altogether, or, with the rabble, have fancied me mad. As it is, you will&#10;easily perceive that I am one of the many uncounted victims of the Imp&#10;of the Perverse.&#10;&#10;It is impossible that any deed could have been wrought with a more&#10;thorough deliberation. For weeks, for months, I pondered upon the&#10;means of the murder. I rejected a thousand schemes, because their&#10;accomplishment involved a chance of detection. At length, in reading&#10;some French Memoirs, I found an account of a nearly fatal illness that&#10;occurred to Madame Pilau, through the agency of a candle accidentally&#10;poisoned. The idea struck my fancy at once. I knew my victim's habit&#10;of reading in bed. I knew, too, that his apartment was narrow and&#10;ill-ventilated. But I need not vex you with impertinent details. I need&#10;not describe the easy artifices by which I substituted, in his bed-room&#10;candle-stand, a wax-light of my own making for the one which I there&#10;found. The next morning he was discovered dead in his bed, and the&#10;Coroner's verdict was--&quot;Death by the visitation of God.&quot;&#10;&#10;Having inherited his estate, all went well with me for years. The idea&#10;of detection never once entered my brain. Of the remains of the fatal&#10;taper I had myself carefully disposed. I had left no shadow of a clew&#10;by which it would be possible to convict, or even to suspect me of the&#10;crime. It is inconceivable how rich a sentiment of satisfaction arose&#10;in my bosom as I reflected upon my absolute security. For a very long&#10;period of time I was accustomed to revel in this sentiment. It afforded&#10;me more real delight than all the mere worldly advantages accruing from&#10;my sin. But there arrived at length an epoch, from which the pleasurable&#10;feeling grew, by scarcely perceptible gradations, into a haunting and&#10;harassing thought. It harassed because it haunted. I could scarcely get&#10;rid of it for an instant. It is quite a common thing to be thus annoyed&#10;with the ringing in our ears, or rather in our memories, of the burthen&#10;of some ordinary song, or some unimpressive snatches from an opera.&#10;Nor will we be the less tormented if the song in itself be good, or&#10;the opera air meritorious. In this manner, at last, I would perpetually&#10;catch myself pondering upon my security, and repeating, in a low&#10;undertone, the phrase, &quot;I am safe.&quot;&#10;&#10;One day, whilst sauntering along the streets, I arrested myself in the&#10;act of murmuring, half aloud, these customary syllables. In a fit of&#10;petulance, I remodelled them thus; &quot;I am safe--I am safe--yes--if I be&#10;not fool enough to make open confession!&quot;&#10;&#10;No sooner had I spoken these words, than I felt an icy chill creep to&#10;my heart. I had had some experience in these fits of perversity, (whose&#10;nature I have been at some trouble to explain), and I remembered well&#10;that in no instance I had successfully resisted their attacks. And now&#10;my own casual self-suggestion that I might possibly be fool enough to&#10;confess the murder of which I had been guilty, confronted me, as if the&#10;very ghost of him whom I had murdered--and beckoned me on to death.&#10;&#10;At first, I made an effort to shake off this nightmare of the soul.&#10;I walked vigorously--faster--still faster--at length I ran. I felt&#10;a maddening desire to shriek aloud. Every succeeding wave of thought&#10;overwhelmed me with new terror, for, alas! I well, too well understood&#10;that to think, in my situation, was to be lost. I still quickened my&#10;pace. I bounded like a madman through the crowded thoroughfares. At&#10;length, the populace took the alarm, and pursued me. I felt then the&#10;consummation of my fate. Could I have torn out my tongue, I would have&#10;done it, but a rough voice resounded in my ears--a rougher grasp seized&#10;me by the shoulder. I turned--I gasped for breath. For a moment I&#10;experienced all the pangs of suffocation; I became blind, and deaf,&#10;and giddy; and then some invisible fiend, I thought, struck me with his&#10;broad palm upon the back. The long imprisoned secret burst forth from my&#10;soul.&#10;&#10;They say that I spoke with a distinct enunciation, but with marked&#10;emphasis and passionate hurry, as if in dread of interruption before&#10;concluding the brief, but pregnant sentences that consigned me to the&#10;hangman and to hell.&#10;&#10;Having related all that was necessary for the fullest judicial&#10;conviction, I fell prostrate in a swoon.&#10;&#10;But why shall I say more? To-day I wear these chains, and am here!&#10;To-morrow I shall be fetterless!--but where?&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;THE ISLAND OF THE FAY&#10;&#10;     Nullus enim locus sine genio est.--_Servius_.&#10;&#10;&quot;LA MUSIQUE,&quot; says Marmontel, in those &quot;Contes Moraux&quot; (*1) which in all&#10;our translations, we have insisted upon calling &quot;Moral Tales,&quot; as if&#10;in mockery of their spirit--&quot;la musique est le seul des talents qui&#10;jouissent de lui-meme; tous les autres veulent des temoins.&quot; He here&#10;confounds the pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacity&#10;for creating them. No more than any other talent, is that for music&#10;susceptible of complete enjoyment, where there is no second party to&#10;appreciate its exercise. And it is only in common with other talents&#10;that it produces effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude. The&#10;idea which the raconteur has either failed to entertain clearly, or&#10;has sacrificed in its expression to his national love of point, is,&#10;doubtless, the very tenable one that the higher order of music is&#10;the most thoroughly estimated when we are exclusively alone. The&#10;proposition, in this form, will be admitted at once by those who love&#10;the lyre for its own sake, and for its spiritual uses. But there is one&#10;pleasure still within the reach of fallen mortality and perhaps only&#10;one--which owes even more than does music to the accessory sentiment&#10;of seclusion. I mean the happiness experienced in the contemplation of&#10;natural scenery. In truth, the man who would behold aright the glory of&#10;God upon earth must in solitude behold that glory. To me, at least, the&#10;presence--not of human life only, but of life in any other form than&#10;that of the green things which grow upon the soil and are voiceless--is&#10;a stain upon the landscape--is at war with the genius of the scene. I&#10;love, indeed, to regard the dark valleys, and the gray rocks, and&#10;the waters that silently smile, and the forests that sigh in uneasy&#10;slumbers, and the proud watchful mountains that look down upon all,--I&#10;love to regard these as themselves but the colossal members of one vast&#10;animate and sentient whole--a whole whose form (that of the sphere)&#10;is the most perfect and most inclusive of all; whose path is among&#10;associate planets; whose meek handmaiden is the moon, whose mediate&#10;sovereign is the sun; whose life is eternity, whose thought is that of&#10;a God; whose enjoyment is knowledge; whose destinies are lost in&#10;immensity, whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own cognizance&#10;of the animalculae which infest the brain--a being which we, in&#10;consequence, regard as purely inanimate and material much in the same&#10;manner as these animalculae must thus regard us.&#10;&#10;Our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on&#10;every hand--notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the&#10;priesthood--that space, and therefore that bulk, is an important&#10;consideration in the eyes of the Almighty. The cycles in which the stars&#10;move are those best adapted for the evolution, without collision, of&#10;the greatest possible number of bodies. The forms of those bodies are&#10;accurately such as, within a given surface, to include the greatest&#10;possible amount of matter;--while the surfaces themselves are&#10;so disposed as to accommodate a denser population than could be&#10;accommodated on the same surfaces otherwise arranged. Nor is it any&#10;argument against bulk being an object with God, that space itself is&#10;infinite; for there may be an infinity of matter to fill it. And&#10;since we see clearly that the endowment of matter with vitality is a&#10;principle--indeed, as far as our judgments extend, the leading principle&#10;in the operations of Deity,--it is scarcely logical to imagine it&#10;confined to the regions of the minute, where we daily trace it, and not&#10;extending to those of the august. As we find cycle within cycle without&#10;end,--yet all revolving around one far-distant centre which is the&#10;God-head, may we not analogically suppose in the same manner, life&#10;within life, the less within the greater, and all within the Spirit&#10;Divine? In short, we are madly erring, through self-esteem, in believing&#10;man, in either his temporal or future destinies, to be of more moment&#10;in the universe than that vast &quot;clod of the valley&quot; which he tills and&#10;contemns, and to which he denies a soul for no more profound reason than&#10;that he does not behold it in operation. (*2)&#10;&#10;These fancies, and such as these, have always given to my meditations&#10;among the mountains and the forests, by the rivers and the ocean, a&#10;tinge of what the everyday world would not fail to term fantastic. My&#10;wanderings amid such scenes have been many, and far-searching, and often&#10;solitary; and the interest with which I have strayed through many a dim,&#10;deep valley, or gazed into the reflected Heaven of many a bright lake,&#10;has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that I have strayed&#10;and gazed alone. What flippant Frenchman was it who said in allusion&#10;to the well-known work of Zimmerman, that, &quot;la solitude est une belle&#10;chose; mais il faut quelqu'un pour vous dire que la solitude est une&#10;belle chose?&quot; The epigram cannot be gainsayed; but the necessity is a&#10;thing that does not exist.&#10;&#10;It was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far distant region&#10;of mountain locked within mountain, and sad rivers and melancholy tarn&#10;writhing or sleeping within all--that I chanced upon a certain rivulet&#10;and island. I came upon them suddenly in the leafy June, and threw&#10;myself upon the turf, beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub,&#10;that I might doze as I contemplated the scene. I felt that thus only&#10;should I look upon it--such was the character of phantasm which it wore.&#10;&#10;On all sides--save to the west, where the sun was about sinking--arose&#10;the verdant walls of the forest. The little river which turned sharply&#10;in its course, and was thus immediately lost to sight, seemed to have&#10;no exit from its prison, but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of&#10;the trees to the east--while in the opposite quarter (so it appeared to&#10;me as I lay at length and glanced upward) there poured down noiselessly&#10;and continuously into the valley, a rich golden and crimson waterfall&#10;from the sunset fountains of the sky.&#10;&#10;About midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in, one&#10;small circular island, profusely verdured, reposed upon the bosom of the&#10;stream.&#10;&#10;So blended bank and shadow there&#10;&#10;That each seemed pendulous in air--so mirror-like was the glassy water,&#10;that it was scarcely possible to say at what point upon the slope of the&#10;emerald turf its crystal dominion began.&#10;&#10;My position enabled me to include in a single view both the eastern and&#10;western extremities of the islet; and I observed a singularly-marked&#10;difference in their aspects. The latter was all one radiant harem of&#10;garden beauties. It glowed and blushed beneath the eyes of the slant&#10;sunlight, and fairly laughed with flowers. The grass was short,&#10;springy, sweet-scented, and Asphodel-interspersed. The trees were lithe,&#10;mirthful, erect--bright, slender, and graceful,--of eastern figure and&#10;foliage, with bark smooth, glossy, and parti-colored. There seemed a&#10;deep sense of life and joy about all; and although no airs blew from out&#10;the heavens, yet every thing had motion through the gentle sweepings to&#10;and fro of innumerable butterflies, that might have been mistaken for&#10;tulips with wings. (*4)&#10;&#10;The other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest shade.&#10;A sombre, yet beautiful and peaceful gloom here pervaded all things. The&#10;trees were dark in color, and mournful in form and attitude, wreathing&#10;themselves into sad, solemn, and spectral shapes that conveyed ideas of&#10;mortal sorrow and untimely death. The grass wore the deep tint of the&#10;cypress, and the heads of its blades hung droopingly, and hither and&#10;thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks, low and narrow,&#10;and not very long, that had the aspect of graves, but were not; although&#10;over and all about them the rue and the rosemary clambered. The shade&#10;of the trees fell heavily upon the water, and seemed to bury itself&#10;therein, impregnating the depths of the element with darkness. I fancied&#10;that each shadow, as the sun descended lower and lower, separated itself&#10;sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth, and thus became absorbed by&#10;the stream; while other shadows issued momently from the trees, taking&#10;the place of their predecessors thus entombed.&#10;&#10;This idea, having once seized upon my fancy, greatly excited it, and I&#10;lost myself forthwith in revery. &quot;If ever island were enchanted,&quot; said&#10;I to myself, &quot;this is it. This is the haunt of the few gentle Fays who&#10;remain from the wreck of the race. Are these green tombs theirs?--or do&#10;they yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own? In dying,&#10;do they not rather waste away mournfully, rendering unto God, little by&#10;little, their existence, as these trees render up shadow after shadow,&#10;exhausting their substance unto dissolution? What the wasting tree is to&#10;the water that imbibes its shade, growing thus blacker by what it preys&#10;upon, may not the life of the Fay be to the death which engulfs it?&quot;&#10;&#10;As I thus mused, with half-shut eyes, while the sun sank rapidly to&#10;rest, and eddying currents careered round and round the island, bearing&#10;upon their bosom large, dazzling, white flakes of the bark of the&#10;sycamore-flakes which, in their multiform positions upon the water, a&#10;quick imagination might have converted into any thing it pleased, while&#10;I thus mused, it appeared to me that the form of one of those very Fays&#10;about whom I had been pondering made its way slowly into the darkness&#10;from out the light at the western end of the island. She stood erect&#10;in a singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom of an&#10;oar. While within the influence of the lingering sunbeams, her attitude&#10;seemed indicative of joy--but sorrow deformed it as she passed within&#10;the shade. Slowly she glided along, and at length rounded the islet and&#10;re-entered the region of light. &quot;The revolution which has just been made&#10;by the Fay,&quot; continued I, musingly, &quot;is the cycle of the brief year of&#10;her life. She has floated through her winter and through her summer. She&#10;is a year nearer unto Death; for I did not fail to see that, as she came&#10;into the shade, her shadow fell from her, and was swallowed up in the&#10;dark water, making its blackness more black.&quot;&#10;&#10;And again the boat appeared and the Fay, but about the attitude of the&#10;latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy.&#10;She floated again from out the light and into the gloom (which deepened&#10;momently) and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water, and&#10;became absorbed into its blackness. And again and again she made the&#10;circuit of the island, (while the sun rushed down to his slumbers), and&#10;at each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person,&#10;while it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct, and at each&#10;passage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade, which became&#10;whelmed in a shadow more black. But at length when the sun had&#10;utterly departed, the Fay, now the mere ghost of her former self, went&#10;disconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony flood, and&#10;that she issued thence at all I cannot say, for darkness fell over all&#10;things and I beheld her magical figure no more.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;THE ASSIGNATION&#10;&#10;     Stay for me there!   I will not fail.&#10;     To meet thee in that hollow vale.&#10;&#10;     [_Exequy on the death of his wife, by Henry King,&#10;      Bishop of Chichester_.]&#10;&#10;ILL-FATED and mysterious man!--bewildered in the brilliancy of thine own&#10;imagination, and fallen in the flames of thine own youth! Again in fancy&#10;I behold thee! Once more thy form hath risen before me!--not--oh not&#10;as thou art--in the cold valley and shadow--but as thou _shouldst&#10;be_--squandering away a life of magnificent meditation in that city of&#10;dim visions, thine own Venice--which is a star-beloved Elysium of the&#10;sea, and the wide windows of whose Palladian palaces look down with a&#10;deep and bitter meaning upon the secrets of her silent waters. Yes! I&#10;repeat it--as thou _shouldst be_. There are surely other worlds&#10;than this--other thoughts than the thoughts of the multitude--other&#10;speculations than the speculations of the sophist. Who then shall call&#10;thy conduct into question? who blame thee for thy visionary hours, or&#10;denounce those occupations as a wasting away of life, which were but the&#10;overflowings of thine everlasting energies?&#10;&#10;It was at Venice, beneath the covered archway there called the _Ponte di&#10;Sospiri_, that I met for the third or fourth time the person of whom&#10;I speak. It is with a confused recollection that I bring to mind&#10;the circumstances of that meeting. Yet I remember--ah! how should I&#10;forget?--the deep midnight, the Bridge of Sighs, the beauty of woman,&#10;and the Genius of Romance that stalked up and down the narrow canal.&#10;&#10;It was a night of unusual gloom. The great clock of the Piazza had&#10;sounded the fifth hour of the Italian evening. The square of the&#10;Campanile lay silent and deserted, and the lights in the old Ducal&#10;Palace were dying fast away. I was returning home from the Piazetta, by&#10;way of the Grand Canal. But as my gondola arrived opposite the mouth&#10;of the canal San Marco, a female voice from its recesses broke suddenly&#10;upon the night, in one wild, hysterical, and long continued shriek.&#10;Startled at the sound, I sprang upon my feet: while the gondolier,&#10;letting slip his single oar, lost it in the pitchy darkness beyond a&#10;chance of recovery, and we were consequently left to the guidance of the&#10;current which here sets from the greater into the smaller channel.&#10;Like some huge and sable-feathered condor, we were slowly drifting down&#10;towards the Bridge of Sighs, when a thousand flambeaux flashing from the&#10;windows, and down the staircases of the Ducal Palace, turned all at once&#10;that deep gloom into a livid and preternatural day.&#10;&#10;A child, slipping from the arms of its own mother, had fallen from an&#10;upper window of the lofty structure into the deep and dim canal. The&#10;quiet waters had closed placidly over their victim; and, although my own&#10;gondola was the only one in sight, many a stout swimmer, already in the&#10;stream, was seeking in vain upon the surface, the treasure which was&#10;to be found, alas! only within the abyss. Upon the broad black marble&#10;flagstones at the entrance of the palace, and a few steps above the&#10;water, stood a figure which none who then saw can have ever since&#10;forgotten. It was the Marchesa Aphrodite--the adoration of all&#10;Venice--the gayest of the gay--the most lovely where all were&#10;beautiful--but still the young wife of the old and intriguing Mentoni,&#10;and the mother of that fair child, her first and only one, who now, deep&#10;beneath the murky water, was thinking in bitterness of heart upon her&#10;sweet caresses, and exhausting its little life in struggles to call upon&#10;her name.&#10;&#10;She stood alone. Her small, bare, and silvery feet gleamed in the&#10;black mirror of marble beneath her. Her hair, not as yet more than&#10;half loosened for the night from its ball-room array, clustered, amid&#10;a shower of diamonds, round and round her classical head, in curls like&#10;those of the young hyacinth. A snowy-white and gauze-like drapery seemed&#10;to be nearly the sole covering to her delicate form; but the mid-summer&#10;and midnight air was hot, sullen, and still, and no motion in the&#10;statue-like form itself, stirred even the folds of that raiment of very&#10;vapor which hung around it as the heavy marble hangs around the Niobe.&#10;Yet--strange to say!--her large lustrous eyes were not turned downwards&#10;upon that grave wherein her brightest hope lay buried--but riveted in a&#10;widely different direction! The prison of the Old Republic is, I think,&#10;the stateliest building in all Venice--but how could that lady gaze so&#10;fixedly upon it, when beneath her lay stifling her only child? Yon dark,&#10;gloomy niche, too, yawns right opposite her chamber window--what,&#10;then, _could_ there be in its shadows--in its architecture--in its&#10;ivy-wreathed and solemn cornices--that the Marchesa di Mentoni had not&#10;wondered at a thousand times before? Nonsense!--Who does not remember&#10;that, at such a time as this, the eye, like a shattered mirror,&#10;multiplies the images of its sorrow, and sees in innumerable far-off&#10;places, the woe which is close at hand?&#10;&#10;Many steps above the Marchesa, and within the arch of the water-gate,&#10;stood, in full dress, the Satyr-like figure of Mentoni himself. He was&#10;occasionally occupied in thrumming a guitar, and seemed _ennuye_ to the&#10;very death, as at intervals he gave directions for the recovery of his&#10;child. Stupified and aghast, I had myself no power to move from the&#10;upright position I had assumed upon first hearing the shriek, and must&#10;have presented to the eyes of the agitated group a spectral and ominous&#10;appearance, as with pale countenance and rigid limbs, I floated down&#10;among them in that funereal gondola.&#10;&#10;All efforts proved in vain. Many of the most energetic in the search&#10;were relaxing their exertions, and yielding to a gloomy sorrow. There&#10;seemed but little hope for the child; (how much less than for the&#10;mother!) but now, from the interior of that dark niche which has been&#10;already mentioned as forming a part of the Old Republican prison, and&#10;as fronting the lattice of the Marchesa, a figure muffled in a cloak,&#10;stepped out within reach of the light, and, pausing a moment upon the&#10;verge of the giddy descent, plunged headlong into the canal. As, in an&#10;instant afterwards, he stood with the still living and breathing&#10;child within his grasp, upon the marble flagstones by the side of the&#10;Marchesa, his cloak, heavy with the drenching water, became unfastened,&#10;and, falling in folds about his feet, discovered to the wonder-stricken&#10;spectators the graceful person of a very young man, with the sound of&#10;whose name the greater part of Europe was then ringing.&#10;&#10;No word spoke the deliverer. But the Marchesa! She will now receive&#10;her child--she will press it to her heart--she will cling to its little&#10;form, and smother it with her caresses. Alas! _another's_ arms have&#10;taken it from the stranger--_another's_ arms have taken it away, and&#10;borne it afar off, unnoticed, into the palace! And the Marchesa! Her&#10;lip--her beautiful lip trembles: tears are gathering in her eyes--those&#10;eyes which, like Pliny's acanthus, are &quot;soft and almost liquid.&quot; Yes!&#10;tears are gathering in those eyes--and see! the entire woman thrills&#10;throughout the soul, and the statue has started into life! The pallor&#10;of the marble countenance, the swelling of the marble bosom, the very&#10;purity of the marble feet, we behold suddenly flushed over with a tide&#10;of ungovernable crimson; and a slight shudder quivers about her delicate&#10;frame, as a gentle air at Napoli about the rich silver lilies in the&#10;grass.&#10;&#10;Why _should_ that lady blush! To this demand there is no answer--except&#10;that, having left, in the eager haste and terror of a mother's heart,&#10;the privacy of her own _boudoir_, she has neglected to enthral her tiny&#10;feet in their slippers, and utterly forgotten to throw over her Venetian&#10;shoulders that drapery which is their due. What other possible reason&#10;could there have been for her so blushing?--for the glance of those wild&#10;appealing eyes? for the unusual tumult of that throbbing bosom?--for the&#10;convulsive pressure of that trembling hand?--that hand which fell,&#10;as Mentoni turned into the palace, accidentally, upon the hand of the&#10;stranger. What reason could there have been for the low--the singularly&#10;low tone of those unmeaning words which the lady uttered hurriedly in&#10;bidding him adieu? &quot;Thou hast conquered,&quot; she said, or the murmurs of&#10;the water deceived me; &quot;thou hast conquered--one hour after sunrise--we&#10;shall meet--so let it be!&quot;&#10;&#10;* * * * *&#10;&#10;The tumult had subsided, the lights had died away within the palace,&#10;and the stranger, whom I now recognized, stood alone upon the flags. He&#10;shook with inconceivable agitation, and his eye glanced around in search&#10;of a gondola. I could not do less than offer him the service of my own;&#10;and he accepted the civility. Having obtained an oar at the water-gate,&#10;we proceeded together to his residence, while he rapidly recovered his&#10;self-possession, and spoke of our former slight acquaintance in terms of&#10;great apparent cordiality.&#10;&#10;There are some subjects upon which I take pleasure in being minute. The&#10;person of the stranger--let me call him by this title, who to all the&#10;world was still a stranger--the person of the stranger is one of these&#10;subjects. In height he might have been below rather than above the&#10;medium size: although there were moments of intense passion when his&#10;frame actually _expanded_ and belied the assertion. The light, almost&#10;slender symmetry of his figure, promised more of that ready activity&#10;which he evinced at the Bridge of Sighs, than of that Herculean strength&#10;which he has been known to wield without an effort, upon occasions of&#10;more dangerous emergency. With the mouth and chin of a deity--singular,&#10;wild, full, liquid eyes, whose shadows varied from pure hazel to intense&#10;and brilliant jet--and a profusion of curling, black hair, from which&#10;a forehead of unusual breadth gleamed forth at intervals all light and&#10;ivory--his were features than which I have seen none more classically&#10;regular, except, perhaps, the marble ones of the Emperor Commodus. Yet&#10;his countenance was, nevertheless, one of those which all men have seen&#10;at some period of their lives, and have never afterwards seen again. It&#10;had no peculiar--it had no settled predominant expression to be fastened&#10;upon the memory; a countenance seen and instantly forgotten--but&#10;forgotten with a vague and never-ceasing desire of recalling it to mind.&#10;Not that the spirit of each rapid passion failed, at any time, to&#10;throw its own distinct image upon the mirror of that face--but that&#10;the mirror, mirror-like, retained no vestige of the passion, when the&#10;passion had departed.&#10;&#10;Upon leaving him on the night of our adventure, he solicited me, in&#10;what I thought an urgent manner, to call upon him _very_ early the&#10;next morning. Shortly after sunrise, I found myself accordingly at his&#10;Palazzo, one of those huge structures of gloomy, yet fantastic pomp,&#10;which tower above the waters of the Grand Canal in the vicinity of the&#10;Rialto. I was shown up a broad winding staircase of mosaics, into an&#10;apartment whose unparalleled splendor burst through the opening door&#10;with an actual glare, making me blind and dizzy with luxuriousness.&#10;&#10;I knew my acquaintance to be wealthy. Report had spoken of his&#10;possessions in terms which I had even ventured to call terms of&#10;ridiculous exaggeration. But as I gazed about me, I could not bring&#10;myself to believe that the wealth of any subject in Europe could have&#10;supplied the princely magnificence which burned and blazed around.&#10;&#10;Although, as I say, the sun had arisen, yet the room was still&#10;brilliantly lighted up. I judge from this circumstance, as well as from&#10;an air of exhaustion in the countenance of my friend, that he had&#10;not retired to bed during the whole of the preceding night. In the&#10;architecture and embellishments of the chamber, the evident design&#10;had been to dazzle and astound. Little attention had been paid to the&#10;_decora_ of what is technically called _keeping_, or to the proprieties&#10;of nationality. The eye wandered from object to object, and rested upon&#10;none--neither the _grotesques_ of the Greek painters, nor the sculptures&#10;of the best Italian days, nor the huge carvings of untutored Egypt. Rich&#10;draperies in every part of the room trembled to the vibration of low,&#10;melancholy music, whose origin was not to be discovered. The senses were&#10;oppressed by mingled and conflicting perfumes, reeking up from strange&#10;convolute censers, together with multitudinous flaring and flickering&#10;tongues of emerald and violet fire. The rays of the newly risen sun&#10;poured in upon the whole, through windows, formed each of a single pane&#10;of crimson-tinted glass. Glancing to and fro, in a thousand reflections,&#10;from curtains which rolled from their cornices like cataracts of molten&#10;silver, the beams of natural glory mingled at length fitfully with the&#10;artificial light, and lay weltering in subdued masses upon a carpet of&#10;rich, liquid-looking cloth of Chili gold.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ha! ha! ha!--ha! ha! ha!&quot;--laughed the proprietor, motioning me to&#10;a seat as I entered the room, and throwing himself back at full-length&#10;upon an ottoman. &quot;I see,&quot; said he, perceiving that I could not&#10;immediately reconcile myself to the _bienseance_ of so singular a&#10;welcome--&quot;I see you are astonished at my apartment--at my statues--my&#10;pictures--my originality of conception in architecture and upholstery!&#10;absolutely drunk, eh, with my magnificence? But pardon me, my dear&#10;sir, (here his tone of voice dropped to the very spirit of cordiality,)&#10;pardon me for my uncharitable laughter. You appeared so _utterly_&#10;astonished. Besides, some things are so completely ludicrous, that a man&#10;_must_ laugh or die. To die laughing, must be the most glorious of&#10;all glorious deaths! Sir Thomas More--a very fine man was Sir Thomas&#10;More--Sir Thomas More died laughing, you remember. Also in the&#10;_Absurdities_ of Ravisius Textor, there is a long list of characters who&#10;came to the same magnificent end. Do you know, however,&quot; continued he&#10;musingly, &quot;that at Sparta (which is now PalÃ¦; ochori,) at Sparta, I say,&#10;to the west of the citadel, among a chaos of scarcely visible ruins, is&#10;a kind of _socle_, upon which are still legible the letters _AAEM_. They&#10;are undoubtedly part of _PEAAEMA_. Now, at Sparta were a thousand temples&#10;and shrines to a thousand different divinities. How exceedingly strange&#10;that the altar of Laughter should have survived all the others! But in&#10;the present instance,&quot; he resumed, with a singular alteration of voice&#10;and manner, &quot;I have no right to be merry at your expense. You might well&#10;have been amazed. Europe cannot produce anything so fine as this, my&#10;little regal cabinet. My other apartments are by no means of the same&#10;order--mere _ultras_ of fashionable insipidity. This is better than&#10;fashion--is it not? Yet this has but to be seen to become the rage--that&#10;is, with those who could afford it at the cost of their entire&#10;patrimony. I have guarded, however, against any such profanation.&#10;With one exception, you are the only human being besides myself and my&#10;_valet_, who has been admitted within the mysteries of these imperial&#10;precincts, since they have been bedizzened as you see!&quot;&#10;&#10;I bowed in acknowledgment--for the overpowering sense of splendor and&#10;perfume, and music, together with the unexpected eccentricity of&#10;his address and manner, prevented me from expressing, in words, my&#10;appreciation of what I might have construed into a compliment.&#10;&#10;&quot;Here,&quot; he resumed, arising and leaning on my arm as he sauntered around&#10;the apartment, &quot;here are paintings from the Greeks to Cimabue, and from&#10;Cimabue to the present hour. Many are chosen, as you see, with little&#10;deference to the opinions of Virtu. They are all, however, fitting&#10;tapestry for a chamber such as this. Here, too, are some _chefs&#10;d'oeuvre_ of the unknown great; and here, unfinished designs by men,&#10;celebrated in their day, whose very names the perspicacity of the&#10;academies has left to silence and to me. What think you,&quot; said he,&#10;turning abruptly as he spoke--&quot;what think you of this Madonna della&#10;Pieta?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is Guido's own!&quot; I said, with all the enthusiasm of my nature, for I&#10;had been poring intently over its surpassing loveliness. &quot;It is Guido's&#10;own!--how _could_ you have obtained it?--she is undoubtedly in painting&#10;what the Venus is in sculpture.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ha!&quot; said he thoughtfully, &quot;the Venus--the beautiful Venus?--the Venus&#10;of the Medici?--she of the diminutive head and the gilded hair? Part of&#10;the left arm (here his voice dropped so as to be heard with difficulty,)&#10;and all the right, are restorations; and in the coquetry of that right&#10;arm lies, I think, the quintessence of all affectation. Give _me_ the&#10;Canova! The Apollo, too, is a copy--there can be no doubt of it--blind&#10;fool that I am, who cannot behold the boasted inspiration of the Apollo!&#10;I cannot help--pity me!--I cannot help preferring the Antinous. Was it&#10;not Socrates who said that the statuary found his statue in the block of&#10;marble? Then Michael Angelo was by no means original in his couplet--&#10;&#10;     'Non ha l'ottimo artista alcun concetto&#10;     Che un marmo solo in se non circunscriva.'&quot;&#10;&#10;It has been, or should be remarked, that, in the manner of the true&#10;gentleman, we are always aware of a difference from the bearing of the&#10;vulgar, without being at once precisely able to determine in what such&#10;difference consists. Allowing the remark to have applied in its full&#10;force to the outward demeanor of my acquaintance, I felt it, on that&#10;eventful morning, still more fully applicable to his moral temperament&#10;and character. Nor can I better define that peculiarity of spirit which&#10;seemed to place him so essentially apart from all other human beings,&#10;than by calling it a _habit_ of intense and continual thought,&#10;pervading even his most trivial actions--intruding upon his moments&#10;of dalliance--and interweaving itself with his very flashes of&#10;merriment--like adders which writhe from out the eyes of the grinning&#10;masks in the cornices around the temples of Persepolis.&#10;&#10;I could not help, however, repeatedly observing, through the mingled&#10;tone of levity and solemnity with which he rapidly descanted upon&#10;matters of little importance, a certain air of trepidation--a degree of&#10;nervous _unction_ in action and in speech--an unquiet excitability of&#10;manner which appeared to me at all times unaccountable, and upon some&#10;occasions even filled me with alarm. Frequently, too, pausing in the&#10;middle of a sentence whose commencement he had apparently forgotten,&#10;he seemed to be listening in the deepest attention, as if either in&#10;momentary expectation of a visiter, or to sounds which must have had&#10;existence in his imagination alone.&#10;&#10;It was during one of these reveries or pauses of apparent abstraction,&#10;that, in turning over a page of the poet and scholar Politian's&#10;beautiful tragedy &quot;The Orfeo,&quot; (the first native Italian tragedy,)&#10;which lay near me upon an ottoman, I discovered a passage underlined in&#10;pencil. It was a passage towards the end of the third act--a passage of&#10;the most heart-stirring excitement--a passage which, although tainted&#10;with impurity, no man shall read without a thrill of novel emotion--no&#10;woman without a sigh. The whole page was blotted with fresh tears; and,&#10;upon the opposite interleaf, were the following English lines,&#10;written in a hand so very different from the peculiar characters of my&#10;acquaintance, that I had some difficulty in recognising it as his own:--&#10;&#10;     Thou wast that all to me, love,&#10;     For which my soul did pine--&#10;     A green isle in the sea, love,&#10;     A fountain and a shrine,&#10;     All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers;&#10;     And all the flowers were mine.&#10;     Ah, dream too bright to last!&#10;     Ah, starry Hope, that didst arise&#10;     But to be overcast!&#10;     A voice from out the Future cries,&#10;     &quot;Onward!&quot;--but o'er the Past&#10;     (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies,&#10;     Mute--motionless--aghast!&#10;     For alas!  alas!  with me&#10;     The light of life is o'er.&#10;     &quot;No more--no more--no more,&quot;&#10;     (Such language holds the solemn sea&#10;     To the sands upon the shore,)&#10;     Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,&#10;     Or the stricken eagle soar!&#10;     Now all my hours are trances;&#10;     And all my nightly dreams&#10;     Are where the dark eye glances,&#10;     And where thy footstep gleams,&#10;     In what ethereal dances,&#10;     By what Italian streams.&#10;     Alas!  for that accursed time&#10;     They bore thee o'er the billow,&#10;     From Love to titled age and crime,&#10;     And an unholy pillow!--&#10;     From me, and from our misty clime,&#10;     Where weeps the silver willow!&#10;&#10;That these lines were written in English--a language with which I had&#10;not believed their author acquainted--afforded me little matter for&#10;surprise. I was too well aware of the extent of his acquirements, and of&#10;the singular pleasure he took in concealing them from observation, to&#10;be astonished at any similar discovery; but the place of date, I must&#10;confess, occasioned me no little amazement. It had been originally&#10;written _London_, and afterwards carefully overscored--not, however, so&#10;effectually as to conceal the word from a scrutinizing eye. I say, this&#10;occasioned me no little amazement; for I well remember that, in a former&#10;conversation with a friend, I particularly inquired if he had at any&#10;time met in London the Marchesa di Mentoni, (who for some years previous&#10;to her marriage had resided in that city,) when his answer, if I mistake&#10;not, gave me to understand that he had never visited the metropolis of&#10;Great Britain. I might as well here mention, that I have more than&#10;once heard, (without, of course, giving credit to a report&#10;involving so many improbabilities,) that the person of whom I speak, was&#10;not only by birth, but in education, an _Englishman_.&#10;&#10;* * * * *&#10;&#10;&quot;There is one painting,&quot; said he, without being aware of my notice of&#10;the tragedy--&quot;there is still one painting which you have not seen.&quot; And&#10;throwing aside a drapery, he discovered a full-length portrait of the&#10;Marchesa Aphrodite.&#10;&#10; Human art could have done no more in the delineation of her&#10;superhuman beauty. The same ethereal figure which stood before me the&#10;preceding night upon the steps of the Ducal Palace, stood before me once&#10;again. But in the expression of the countenance, which was beaming all&#10;over with smiles, there still lurked (incomprehensible anomaly!) that&#10;fitful stain of melancholy which will ever be found inseparable from the&#10;perfection of the beautiful. Her right arm lay folded over her bosom.&#10;With her left she pointed downward to a curiously fashioned vase.&#10;One small, fairy foot, alone visible, barely touched the earth; and,&#10;scarcely discernible in the brilliant atmosphere which seemed to&#10;encircle and enshrine her loveliness, floated a pair of the most&#10;delicately imagined wings. My glance fell from the painting to the&#10;figure of my friend, and the vigorous words of Chapman's _Bussy&#10;D'Ambois_, quivered instinctively upon my lips:&#10;&#10;                     &quot;He is up&#10;     There like a Roman statue!  He will stand&#10;     Till Death hath made him marble!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Come,&quot; he said at length, turning towards a table of richly enamelled&#10;and massive silver, upon which were a few goblets fantastically&#10;stained, together with two large Etruscan vases, fashioned in the same&#10;extraordinary model as that in the foreground of the portrait, and&#10;filled with what I supposed to be Johannisberger. &quot;Come,&quot; he said,&#10;abruptly, &quot;let us drink! It is early--but let us drink. It is _indeed_&#10;early,&quot; he continued, musingly, as a cherub with a heavy golden hammer&#10;made the apartment ring with the first hour after sunrise: &quot;It is&#10;_indeed_ early--but what matters it? let us drink! Let us pour out an&#10;offering to yon solemn sun which these gaudy lamps and censers are&#10;so eager to subdue!&quot; And, having made me pledge him in a bumper, he&#10;swallowed in rapid succession several goblets of the wine.&#10;&#10;&quot;To dream,&quot; he continued, resuming the tone of his desultory&#10;conversation, as he held up to the rich light of a censer one of the&#10;magnificent vases--&quot;to dream has been the business of my life. I have&#10;therefore framed for myself, as you see, a bower of dreams. In the heart&#10;of Venice could I have erected a better? You behold around you, it is&#10;true, a medley of architectural embellishments. The chastity of Ionia&#10;is offended by antediluvian devices, and the sphynxes of Egypt are&#10;outstretched upon carpets of gold. Yet the effect is incongruous to&#10;the timid alone. Proprieties of place, and especially of time, are&#10;the bugbears which terrify mankind from the contemplation of the&#10;magnificent. Once I was myself a decorist; but that sublimation of folly&#10;has palled upon my soul. All this is now the fitter for my purpose. Like&#10;these arabesque censers, my spirit is writhing in fire, and the delirium&#10;of this scene is fashioning me for the wilder visions of that land&#10;of real dreams whither I am now rapidly departing.&quot; He here paused&#10;abruptly, bent his head to his bosom, and seemed to listen to a sound&#10;which I could not hear. At length, erecting his frame, he looked&#10;upwards, and ejaculated the lines of the Bishop of Chichester:&#10;&#10;     _&quot;Stay for me there!  I will not fail_&#10;     _To meet thee in that hollow vale.&quot;_&#10;&#10;In the next instant, confessing the power of the wine, he threw himself&#10;at full-length upon an ottoman.&#10;&#10;A quick step was now heard upon the staircase, and a loud knock at&#10;the door rapidly succeeded. I was hastening to anticipate a second&#10;disturbance, when a page of Mentoni's household burst into the room, and&#10;faltered out, in a voice choking with emotion, the incoherent words,&#10;&quot;My mistress!--my mistress!--Poisoned!--poisoned! Oh, beautiful--oh,&#10;beautiful Aphrodite!&quot;&#10;&#10;Bewildered, I flew to the ottoman, and endeavored to arouse the sleeper&#10;to a sense of the startling intelligence. But his limbs were rigid--his&#10;lips were livid--his lately beaming eyes were riveted in _death_.&#10;I staggered back towards the table--my hand fell upon a cracked and&#10;blackened goblet--and a consciousness of the entire and terrible truth&#10;flashed suddenly over my soul.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM&#10;&#10;     Impia tortorum longos hic turba furores&#10;     Sanguinis innocui, non satiata, aluit.&#10;     Sospite nunc patria, fracto nunc funeris antro,&#10;     Mors ubi dira fuit vita salusque patent.&#10;&#10;     [_Quatrain composed for the gates of a market to be erected&#10;     upon the site of the Jacobin Club House at Paris_.]&#10;&#10;I WAS sick--sick unto death with that long agony; and when they at&#10;length unbound me, and I was permitted to sit, I felt that my senses&#10;were leaving me. The sentence--the dread sentence of death--was the last&#10;of distinct accentuation which reached my ears. After that, the sound of&#10;the inquisitorial voices seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate&#10;hum. It conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution--perhaps from its&#10;association in fancy with the burr of a mill wheel. This only for a&#10;brief period; for presently I heard no more. Yet, for a while, I saw;&#10;but with how terrible an exaggeration! I saw the lips of the black-robed&#10;judges. They appeared to me white--whiter than the sheet upon which&#10;I trace these words--and thin even to grotesqueness; thin with the&#10;intensity of their expression of firmness--of immoveable resolution--of&#10;stern contempt of human torture. I saw that the decrees of what to me&#10;was Fate, were still issuing from those lips. I saw them writhe with&#10;a deadly locution. I saw them fashion the syllables of my name; and I&#10;shuddered because no sound succeeded. I saw, too, for a few moments of&#10;delirious horror, the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable&#10;draperies which enwrapped the walls of the apartment. And then my vision&#10;fell upon the seven tall candles upon the table. At first they wore the&#10;aspect of charity, and seemed white and slender angels who would save&#10;me; but then, all at once, there came a most deadly nausea over my&#10;spirit, and I felt every fibre in my frame thrill as if I had touched&#10;the wire of a galvanic battery, while the angel forms became meaningless&#10;spectres, with heads of flame, and I saw that from them there would be&#10;no help. And then there stole into my fancy, like a rich musical note,&#10;the thought of what sweet rest there must be in the grave. The thought&#10;came gently and stealthily, and it seemed long before it attained full&#10;appreciation; but just as my spirit came at length properly to feel and&#10;entertain it, the figures of the judges vanished, as if magically, from&#10;before me; the tall candles sank into nothingness; their flames went out&#10;utterly; the blackness of darkness supervened; all sensations appeared&#10;swallowed up in a mad rushing descent as of the soul into Hades. Then&#10;silence, and stillness, night were the universe.&#10;&#10;I had swooned; but still will not say that all of consciousness was&#10;lost. What of it there remained I will not attempt to define, or even&#10;to describe; yet all was not lost. In the deepest slumber--no! In&#10;delirium--no! In a swoon--no! In death--no! even in the grave all is&#10;not lost. Else there is no immortality for man. Arousing from the most&#10;profound of slumbers, we break the gossamer web of some dream. Yet in a&#10;second afterward, (so frail may that web have been) we remember not&#10;that we have dreamed. In the return to life from the swoon there are two&#10;stages; first, that of the sense of mental or spiritual; secondly, that&#10;of the sense of physical, existence. It seems probable that if, upon&#10;reaching the second stage, we could recall the impressions of the&#10;first, we should find these impressions eloquent in memories of the gulf&#10;beyond. And that gulf is--what? How at least shall we distinguish its&#10;shadows from those of the tomb? But if the impressions of what I have&#10;termed the first stage, are not, at will, recalled, yet, after long&#10;interval, do they not come unbidden, while we marvel whence they come?&#10;He who has never swooned, is not he who finds strange palaces and wildly&#10;familiar faces in coals that glow; is not he who beholds floating&#10;in mid-air the sad visions that the many may not view; is not he who&#10;ponders over the perfume of some novel flower--is not he whose brain&#10;grows bewildered with the meaning of some musical cadence which has&#10;never before arrested his attention.&#10;&#10;Amid frequent and thoughtful endeavors to remember; amid earnest&#10;struggles to regather some token of the state of seeming nothingness&#10;into which my soul had lapsed, there have been moments when I have&#10;dreamed of success; there have been brief, very brief periods when I&#10;have conjured up remembrances which the lucid reason of a later epoch&#10;assures me could have had reference only to that condition of seeming&#10;unconsciousness. These shadows of memory tell, indistinctly, of tall&#10;figures that lifted and bore me in silence down--down--still&#10;down--till a hideous dizziness oppressed me at the mere idea of the&#10;interminableness of the descent. They tell also of a vague horror at&#10;my heart, on account of that heart's unnatural stillness. Then comes a&#10;sense of sudden motionlessness throughout all things; as if those who&#10;bore me (a ghastly train!) had outrun, in their descent, the limits of&#10;the limitless, and paused from the wearisomeness of their toil. After&#10;this I call to mind flatness and dampness; and then all is madness--the&#10;madness of a memory which busies itself among forbidden things.&#10;&#10;Very suddenly there came back to my soul motion and sound--the&#10;tumultuous motion of the heart, and, in my ears, the sound of its&#10;beating. Then a pause in which all is blank. Then again sound, and&#10;motion, and touch--a tingling sensation pervading my frame. Then the&#10;mere consciousness of existence, without thought--a condition which&#10;lasted long. Then, very suddenly, thought, and shuddering terror, and&#10;earnest endeavor to comprehend my true state. Then a strong desire&#10;to lapse into insensibility. Then a rushing revival of soul and a&#10;successful effort to move. And now a full memory of the trial, of the&#10;judges, of the sable draperies, of the sentence, of the sickness, of&#10;the swoon. Then entire forgetfulness of all that followed; of all that&#10;a later day and much earnestness of endeavor have enabled me vaguely to&#10;recall.&#10;&#10;So far, I had not opened my eyes. I felt that I lay upon my back,&#10;unbound. I reached out my hand, and it fell heavily upon something damp&#10;and hard. There I suffered it to remain for many minutes, while I strove&#10;to imagine where and what I could be. I longed, yet dared not to employ&#10;my vision. I dreaded the first glance at objects around me. It was not&#10;that I feared to look upon things horrible, but that I grew aghast lest&#10;there should be nothing to see. At length, with a wild desperation&#10;at heart, I quickly unclosed my eyes. My worst thoughts, then, were&#10;confirmed. The blackness of eternal night encompassed me. I struggled&#10;for breath. The intensity of the darkness seemed to oppress and stifle&#10;me. The atmosphere was intolerably close. I still lay quietly, and&#10;made effort to exercise my reason. I brought to mind the inquisitorial&#10;proceedings, and attempted from that point to deduce my real condition.&#10;The sentence had passed; and it appeared to me that a very long interval&#10;of time had since elapsed. Yet not for a moment did I suppose myself&#10;actually dead. Such a supposition, notwithstanding what we read in&#10;fiction, is altogether inconsistent with real existence;--but where and&#10;in what state was I? The condemned to death, I knew, perished usually at&#10;the autos-da-fe, and one of these had been held on the very night of the&#10;day of my trial. Had I been remanded to my dungeon, to await the next&#10;sacrifice, which would not take place for many months? This I at once&#10;saw could not be. Victims had been in immediate demand. Moreover, my&#10;dungeon, as well as all the condemned cells at Toledo, had stone floors,&#10;and light was not altogether excluded.&#10;&#10;A fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my heart,&#10;and for a brief period, I once more relapsed into insensibility. Upon&#10;recovering, I at once started to my feet, trembling convulsively&#10;in every fibre. I thrust my arms wildly above and around me in all&#10;directions. I felt nothing; yet dreaded to move a step, lest I should be&#10;impeded by the walls of a tomb. Perspiration burst from every pore, and&#10;stood in cold big beads upon my forehead. The agony of suspense grew&#10;at length intolerable, and I cautiously moved forward, with my arms&#10;extended, and my eyes straining from their sockets, in the hope of&#10;catching some faint ray of light. I proceeded for many paces; but still&#10;all was blackness and vacancy. I breathed more freely. It seemed evident&#10;that mine was not, at least, the most hideous of fates.&#10;&#10;And now, as I still continued to step cautiously onward, there came&#10;thronging upon my recollection a thousand vague rumors of the horrors of&#10;Toledo. Of the dungeons there had been strange things narrated--fables I&#10;had always deemed them--but yet strange, and too ghastly to repeat, save&#10;in a whisper. Was I left to perish of starvation in this subterranean&#10;world of darkness; or what fate, perhaps even more fearful, awaited&#10;me? That the result would be death, and a death of more than customary&#10;bitterness, I knew too well the character of my judges to doubt. The&#10;mode and the hour were all that occupied or distracted me.&#10;&#10;My outstretched hands at length encountered some solid obstruction. It&#10;was a wall, seemingly of stone masonry--very smooth, slimy, and cold.&#10;I followed it up; stepping with all the careful distrust with which&#10;certain antique narratives had inspired me. This process, however,&#10;afforded me no means of ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon; as&#10;I might make its circuit, and return to the point whence I set out,&#10;without being aware of the fact; so perfectly uniform seemed the wall.&#10;I therefore sought the knife which had been in my pocket, when led&#10;into the inquisitorial chamber; but it was gone; my clothes had been&#10;exchanged for a wrapper of coarse serge. I had thought of forcing the&#10;blade in some minute crevice of the masonry, so as to identify my point&#10;of departure. The difficulty, nevertheless, was but trivial; although,&#10;in the disorder of my fancy, it seemed at first insuperable. I tore a&#10;part of the hem from the robe and placed the fragment at full length,&#10;and at right angles to the wall. In groping my way around the prison, I&#10;could not fail to encounter this rag upon completing the circuit. So, at&#10;least I thought: but I had not counted upon the extent of the dungeon,&#10;or upon my own weakness. The ground was moist and slippery. I staggered&#10;onward for some time, when I stumbled and fell. My excessive fatigue&#10;induced me to remain prostrate; and sleep soon overtook me as I lay.&#10;&#10;Upon awaking, and stretching forth an arm, I found beside me a loaf&#10;and a pitcher with water. I was too much exhausted to reflect upon&#10;this circumstance, but ate and drank with avidity. Shortly afterward, I&#10;resumed my tour around the prison, and with much toil came at last upon&#10;the fragment of the serge. Up to the period when I fell I had counted&#10;fifty-two paces, and upon resuming my walk, I had counted forty-eight&#10;more;--when I arrived at the rag. There were in all, then, a hundred&#10;paces; and, admitting two paces to the yard, I presumed the dungeon to&#10;be fifty yards in circuit. I had met, however, with many angles in the&#10;wall, and thus I could form no guess at the shape of the vault; for&#10;vault I could not help supposing it to be.&#10;&#10;I had little object--certainly no hope--in these researches; but a vague&#10;curiosity prompted me to continue them. Quitting the wall, I resolved&#10;to cross the area of the enclosure. At first I proceeded with extreme&#10;caution, for the floor, although seemingly of solid material, was&#10;treacherous with slime. At length, however, I took courage, and did not&#10;hesitate to step firmly; endeavoring to cross in as direct a line as&#10;possible. I had advanced some ten or twelve paces in this manner, when&#10;the remnant of the torn hem of my robe became entangled between my legs.&#10;I stepped on it, and fell violently on my face.&#10;&#10;In the confusion attending my fall, I did not immediately apprehend a&#10;somewhat startling circumstance, which yet, in a few seconds afterward,&#10;and while I still lay prostrate, arrested my attention. It was this--my&#10;chin rested upon the floor of the prison, but my lips and the upper&#10;portion of my head, although seemingly at a less elevation than the&#10;chin, touched nothing. At the same time my forehead seemed bathed in&#10;a clammy vapor, and the peculiar smell of decayed fungus arose to my&#10;nostrils. I put forward my arm, and shuddered to find that I had fallen&#10;at the very brink of a circular pit, whose extent, of course, I had&#10;no means of ascertaining at the moment. Groping about the masonry just&#10;below the margin, I succeeded in dislodging a small fragment, and let it&#10;fall into the abyss. For many seconds I hearkened to its reverberations&#10;as it dashed against the sides of the chasm in its descent; at length&#10;there was a sullen plunge into water, succeeded by loud echoes. At the&#10;same moment there came a sound resembling the quick opening, and as&#10;rapid closing of a door overhead, while a faint gleam of light flashed&#10;suddenly through the gloom, and as suddenly faded away.&#10;&#10;I saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for me, and congratulated&#10;myself upon the timely accident by which I had escaped. Another step&#10;before my fall, and the world had seen me no more. And the death just&#10;avoided, was of that very character which I had regarded as fabulous and&#10;frivolous in the tales respecting the Inquisition. To the victims of its&#10;tyranny, there was the choice of death with its direst physical agonies,&#10;or death with its most hideous moral horrors. I had been reserved for&#10;the latter. By long suffering my nerves had been unstrung, until I&#10;trembled at the sound of my own voice, and had become in every respect a&#10;fitting subject for the species of torture which awaited me.&#10;&#10;Shaking in every limb, I groped my way back to the wall; resolving&#10;there to perish rather than risk the terrors of the wells, of which my&#10;imagination now pictured many in various positions about the dungeon.&#10;In other conditions of mind I might have had courage to end my misery at&#10;once by a plunge into one of these abysses; but now I was the veriest of&#10;cowards. Neither could I forget what I had read of these pits--that the&#10;sudden extinction of life formed no part of their most horrible plan.&#10;&#10;Agitation of spirit kept me awake for many long hours; but at length I&#10;again slumbered. Upon arousing, I found by my side, as before, a loaf&#10;and a pitcher of water. A burning thirst consumed me, and I emptied&#10;the vessel at a draught. It must have been drugged; for scarcely had I&#10;drunk, before I became irresistibly drowsy. A deep sleep fell upon me--a&#10;sleep like that of death. How long it lasted of course, I know not;&#10;but when, once again, I unclosed my eyes, the objects around me were&#10;visible. By a wild sulphurous lustre, the origin of which I could not&#10;at first determine, I was enabled to see the extent and aspect of the&#10;prison.&#10;&#10;In its size I had been greatly mistaken. The whole circuit of its walls&#10;did not exceed twenty-five yards. For some minutes this fact occasioned&#10;me a world of vain trouble; vain indeed! for what could be of less&#10;importance, under the terrible circumstances which environed me, then&#10;the mere dimensions of my dungeon? But my soul took a wild interest in&#10;trifles, and I busied myself in endeavors to account for the error I had&#10;committed in my measurement. The truth at length flashed upon me. In my&#10;first attempt at exploration I had counted fifty-two paces, up to the&#10;period when I fell; I must then have been within a pace or two of the&#10;fragment of serge; in fact, I had nearly performed the circuit of the&#10;vault. I then slept, and upon awaking, I must have returned upon my&#10;steps--thus supposing the circuit nearly double what it actually was. My&#10;confusion of mind prevented me from observing that I began my tour with&#10;the wall to the left, and ended it with the wall to the right.&#10;&#10;I had been deceived, too, in respect to the shape of the enclosure.&#10;In feeling my way I had found many angles, and thus deduced an idea of&#10;great irregularity; so potent is the effect of total darkness upon one&#10;arousing from lethargy or sleep! The angles were simply those of a few&#10;slight depressions, or niches, at odd intervals. The general shape of&#10;the prison was square. What I had taken for masonry seemed now to be&#10;iron, or some other metal, in huge plates, whose sutures or joints&#10;occasioned the depression. The entire surface of this metallic enclosure&#10;was rudely daubed in all the hideous and repulsive devices to which the&#10;charnel superstition of the monks has given rise. The figures of fiends&#10;in aspects of menace, with skeleton forms, and other more really&#10;fearful images, overspread and disfigured the walls. I observed that the&#10;outlines of these monstrosities were sufficiently distinct, but that&#10;the colors seemed faded and blurred, as if from the effects of a damp&#10;atmosphere. I now noticed the floor, too, which was of stone. In the&#10;centre yawned the circular pit from whose jaws I had escaped; but it was&#10;the only one in the dungeon.&#10;&#10;All this I saw indistinctly and by much effort: for my personal&#10;condition had been greatly changed during slumber. I now lay upon my&#10;back, and at full length, on a species of low framework of wood. To this&#10;I was securely bound by a long strap resembling a surcingle. It passed&#10;in many convolutions about my limbs and body, leaving at liberty only&#10;my head, and my left arm to such extent that I could, by dint of much&#10;exertion, supply myself with food from an earthen dish which lay by&#10;my side on the floor. I saw, to my horror, that the pitcher had been&#10;removed. I say to my horror; for I was consumed with intolerable thirst.&#10;This thirst it appeared to be the design of my persecutors to stimulate:&#10;for the food in the dish was meat pungently seasoned.&#10;&#10;Looking upward, I surveyed the ceiling of my prison. It was some thirty&#10;or forty feet overhead, and constructed much as the side walls. In one&#10;of its panels a very singular figure riveted my whole attention. It was&#10;the painted figure of Time as he is commonly represented, save that, in&#10;lieu of a scythe, he held what, at a casual glance, I supposed to be&#10;the pictured image of a huge pendulum such as we see on antique clocks.&#10;There was something, however, in the appearance of this machine which&#10;caused me to regard it more attentively. While I gazed directly upward&#10;at it (for its position was immediately over my own) I fancied that I&#10;saw it in motion. In an instant afterward the fancy was confirmed. Its&#10;sweep was brief, and of course slow. I watched it for some minutes,&#10;somewhat in fear, but more in wonder. Wearied at length with observing&#10;its dull movement, I turned my eyes upon the other objects in the cell.&#10;&#10;A slight noise attracted my notice, and, looking to the floor, I saw&#10;several enormous rats traversing it. They had issued from the well,&#10;which lay just within view to my right. Even then, while I gazed, they&#10;came up in troops, hurriedly, with ravenous eyes, allured by the scent&#10;of the meat. From this it required much effort and attention to scare&#10;them away.&#10;&#10;It might have been half an hour, perhaps even an hour, (for I could take&#10;but imperfect note of time) before I again cast my eyes upward. What&#10;I then saw confounded and amazed me. The sweep of the pendulum had&#10;increased in extent by nearly a yard. As a natural consequence, its&#10;velocity was also much greater. But what mainly disturbed me was the&#10;idea that had perceptibly descended. I now observed--with what horror it&#10;is needless to say--that its nether extremity was formed of a crescent&#10;of glittering steel, about a foot in length from horn to horn; the horns&#10;upward, and the under edge evidently as keen as that of a razor. Like&#10;a razor also, it seemed massy and heavy, tapering from the edge into&#10;a solid and broad structure above. It was appended to a weighty rod of&#10;brass, and the whole hissed as it swung through the air.&#10;&#10;I could no longer doubt the doom prepared for me by monkish ingenuity in&#10;torture. My cognizance of the pit had become known to the inquisitorial&#10;agents--the pit whose horrors had been destined for so bold a recusant&#10;as myself--the pit, typical of hell, and regarded by rumor as the Ultima&#10;Thule of all their punishments. The plunge into this pit I had avoided&#10;by the merest of accidents, I knew that surprise, or entrapment into&#10;torment, formed an important portion of all the grotesquerie of these&#10;dungeon deaths. Having failed to fall, it was no part of the demon&#10;plan to hurl me into the abyss; and thus (there being no alternative) a&#10;different and a milder destruction awaited me. Milder! I half smiled in&#10;my agony as I thought of such application of such a term.&#10;&#10;What boots it to tell of the long, long hours of horror more than&#10;mortal, during which I counted the rushing vibrations of the steel! Inch&#10;by inch--line by line--with a descent only appreciable at intervals that&#10;seemed ages--down and still down it came! Days passed--it might have&#10;been that many days passed--ere it swept so closely over me as to fan me&#10;with its acrid breath. The odor of the sharp steel forced itself into my&#10;nostrils. I prayed--I wearied heaven with my prayer for its more speedy&#10;descent. I grew frantically mad, and struggled to force myself upward&#10;against the sweep of the fearful scimitar. And then I fell suddenly&#10;calm, and lay smiling at the glittering death, as a child at some rare&#10;bauble.&#10;&#10;There was another interval of utter insensibility; it was brief; for,&#10;upon again lapsing into life there had been no perceptible descent in&#10;the pendulum. But it might have been long; for I knew there were demons&#10;who took note of my swoon, and who could have arrested the vibration at&#10;pleasure. Upon my recovery, too, I felt very--oh, inexpressibly sick&#10;and weak, as if through long inanition. Even amid the agonies of that&#10;period, the human nature craved food. With painful effort I outstretched&#10;my left arm as far as my bonds permitted, and took possession of the&#10;small remnant which had been spared me by the rats. As I put a portion&#10;of it within my lips, there rushed to my mind a half formed thought of&#10;joy--of hope. Yet what business had I with hope? It was, as I say, a&#10;half formed thought--man has many such which are never completed. I felt&#10;that it was of joy--of hope; but felt also that it had perished in its&#10;formation. In vain I struggled to perfect--to regain it. Long suffering&#10;had nearly annihilated all my ordinary powers of mind. I was an&#10;imbecile--an idiot.&#10;&#10;The vibration of the pendulum was at right angles to my length. I saw&#10;that the crescent was designed to cross the region of the heart.&#10;It would fray the serge of my robe--it would return and repeat its&#10;operations--again--and again. Notwithstanding terrifically wide sweep&#10;(some thirty feet or more) and the hissing vigor of its descent,&#10;sufficient to sunder these very walls of iron, still the fraying of my&#10;robe would be all that, for several minutes, it would accomplish. And&#10;at this thought I paused. I dared not go farther than this reflection. I&#10;dwelt upon it with a pertinacity of attention--as if, in so dwelling,&#10;I could arrest here the descent of the steel. I forced myself to&#10;ponder upon the sound of the crescent as it should pass across the&#10;garment--upon the peculiar thrilling sensation which the friction of&#10;cloth produces on the nerves. I pondered upon all this frivolity until&#10;my teeth were on edge.&#10;&#10;Down--steadily down it crept. I took a frenzied pleasure in contrasting&#10;its downward with its lateral velocity. To the right--to the left--far&#10;and wide--with the shriek of a damned spirit; to my heart with the&#10;stealthy pace of the tiger! I alternately laughed and howled as the one&#10;or the other idea grew predominant.&#10;&#10;Down--certainly, relentlessly down! It vibrated within three inches of&#10;my bosom! I struggled violently, furiously, to free my left arm. This&#10;was free only from the elbow to the hand. I could reach the latter, from&#10;the platter beside me, to my mouth, with great effort, but no farther.&#10;Could I have broken the fastenings above the elbow, I would have seized&#10;and attempted to arrest the pendulum. I might as well have attempted to&#10;arrest an avalanche!&#10;&#10;Down--still unceasingly--still inevitably down! I gasped and struggled&#10;at each vibration. I shrunk convulsively at its every sweep. My eyes&#10;followed its outward or upward whirls with the eagerness of the most&#10;unmeaning despair; they closed themselves spasmodically at the descent,&#10;although death would have been a relief, oh! how unspeakable! Still I&#10;quivered in every nerve to think how slight a sinking of the machinery&#10;would precipitate that keen, glistening axe upon my bosom. It was hope&#10;that prompted the nerve to quiver--the frame to shrink. It was hope--the&#10;hope that triumphs on the rack--that whispers to the death-condemned&#10;even in the dungeons of the Inquisition.&#10;&#10;I saw that some ten or twelve vibrations would bring the steel in actual&#10;contact with my robe, and with this observation there suddenly came over&#10;my spirit all the keen, collected calmness of despair. For the first&#10;time during many hours--or perhaps days--I thought. It now occurred to&#10;me that the bandage, or surcingle, which enveloped me, was unique. I&#10;was tied by no separate cord. The first stroke of the razorlike crescent&#10;athwart any portion of the band, would so detach it that it might be&#10;unwound from my person by means of my left hand. But how fearful, in&#10;that case, the proximity of the steel! The result of the slightest&#10;struggle how deadly! Was it likely, moreover, that the minions of the&#10;torturer had not foreseen and provided for this possibility! Was it&#10;probable that the bandage crossed my bosom in the track of the pendulum?&#10;Dreading to find my faint, and, as it seemed, my last hope frustrated,&#10;I so far elevated my head as to obtain a distinct view of my breast. The&#10;surcingle enveloped my limbs and body close in all directions--save in&#10;the path of the destroying crescent.&#10;&#10;Scarcely had I dropped my head back into its original position, when&#10;there flashed upon my mind what I cannot better describe than as the&#10;unformed half of that idea of deliverance to which I have previously&#10;alluded, and of which a moiety only floated indeterminately through my&#10;brain when I raised food to my burning lips. The whole thought was now&#10;present--feeble, scarcely sane, scarcely definite,--but still entire.&#10;I proceeded at once, with the nervous energy of despair, to attempt its&#10;execution.&#10;&#10;For many hours the immediate vicinity of the low framework upon which&#10;I lay, had been literally swarming with rats. They were wild, bold,&#10;ravenous; their red eyes glaring upon me as if they waited but for&#10;motionlessness on my part to make me their prey. &quot;To what food,&quot; I&#10;thought, &quot;have they been accustomed in the well?&quot;&#10;&#10;They had devoured, in spite of all my efforts to prevent them, all but a&#10;small remnant of the contents of the dish. I had fallen into an habitual&#10;see-saw, or wave of the hand about the platter: and, at length, the&#10;unconscious uniformity of the movement deprived it of effect. In their&#10;voracity the vermin frequently fastened their sharp fangs in my fingers.&#10;With the particles of the oily and spicy viand which now remained, I&#10;thoroughly rubbed the bandage wherever I could reach it; then, raising&#10;my hand from the floor, I lay breathlessly still.&#10;&#10;At first the ravenous animals were startled and terrified at the&#10;change--at the cessation of movement. They shrank alarmedly back; many&#10;sought the well. But this was only for a moment. I had not counted in&#10;vain upon their voracity. Observing that I remained without motion,&#10;one or two of the boldest leaped upon the frame-work, and smelt at the&#10;surcingle. This seemed the signal for a general rush. Forth from the&#10;well they hurried in fresh troops. They clung to the wood--they overran&#10;it, and leaped in hundreds upon my person. The measured movement of the&#10;pendulum disturbed them not at all. Avoiding its strokes they busied&#10;themselves with the anointed bandage. They pressed--they swarmed upon me&#10;in ever accumulating heaps. They writhed upon my throat; their cold lips&#10;sought my own; I was half stifled by their thronging pressure; disgust,&#10;for which the world has no name, swelled my bosom, and chilled, with a&#10;heavy clamminess, my heart. Yet one minute, and I felt that the struggle&#10;would be over. Plainly I perceived the loosening of the bandage. I knew&#10;that in more than one place it must be already severed. With a more than&#10;human resolution I lay still.&#10;&#10;Nor had I erred in my calculations--nor had I endured in vain. I at&#10;length felt that I was free. The surcingle hung in ribands from my body.&#10;But the stroke of the pendulum already pressed upon my bosom. It had&#10;divided the serge of the robe. It had cut through the linen beneath.&#10;Twice again it swung, and a sharp sense of pain shot through every&#10;nerve. But the moment of escape had arrived. At a wave of my hand my&#10;deliverers hurried tumultuously away. With a steady movement--cautious,&#10;sidelong, shrinking, and slow--I slid from the embrace of the bandage&#10;and beyond the reach of the scimitar. For the moment, at least, I was&#10;free.&#10;&#10;Free!--and in the grasp of the Inquisition! I had scarcely stepped from&#10;my wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the prison, when the&#10;motion of the hellish machine ceased and I beheld it drawn up, by some&#10;invisible force, through the ceiling. This was a lesson which I took&#10;desperately to heart. My every motion was undoubtedly watched. Free!--I&#10;had but escaped death in one form of agony, to be delivered unto worse&#10;than death in some other. With that thought I rolled my eves&#10;nervously around on the barriers of iron that hemmed me in. Something&#10;unusual--some change which, at first, I could not appreciate&#10;distinctly--it was obvious, had taken place in the apartment. For many&#10;minutes of a dreamy and trembling abstraction, I busied myself in vain,&#10;unconnected conjecture. During this period, I became aware, for the&#10;first time, of the origin of the sulphurous light which illumined&#10;the cell. It proceeded from a fissure, about half an inch in width,&#10;extending entirely around the prison at the base of the walls, which&#10;thus appeared, and were, completely separated from the floor. I&#10;endeavored, but of course in vain, to look through the aperture.&#10;&#10;As I arose from the attempt, the mystery of the alteration in the&#10;chamber broke at once upon my understanding. I have observed that,&#10;although the outlines of the figures upon the walls were sufficiently&#10;distinct, yet the colors seemed blurred and indefinite. These colors had&#10;now assumed, and were momentarily assuming, a startling and most intense&#10;brilliancy, that gave to the spectral and fiendish portraitures an&#10;aspect that might have thrilled even firmer nerves than my own. Demon&#10;eyes, of a wild and ghastly vivacity, glared upon me in a thousand&#10;directions, where none had been visible before, and gleamed with the&#10;lurid lustre of a fire that I could not force my imagination to regard&#10;as unreal.&#10;&#10;Unreal!--Even while I breathed there came to my nostrils the breath of&#10;the vapour of heated iron! A suffocating odour pervaded the prison! A&#10;deeper glow settled each moment in the eyes that glared at my agonies!&#10;A richer tint of crimson diffused itself over the pictured horrors of&#10;blood. I panted! I gasped for breath! There could be no doubt of the&#10;design of my tormentors--oh! most unrelenting! oh! most demoniac of&#10;men! I shrank from the glowing metal to the centre of the cell. Amid the&#10;thought of the fiery destruction that impended, the idea of the coolness&#10;of the well came over my soul like balm. I rushed to its deadly brink.&#10;I threw my straining vision below. The glare from the enkindled roof&#10;illumined its inmost recesses. Yet, for a wild moment, did my spirit&#10;refuse to comprehend the meaning of what I saw. At length it forced--it&#10;wrestled its way into my soul--it burned itself in upon my shuddering&#10;reason.--Oh! for a voice to speak!--oh! horror!--oh! any horror but&#10;this! With a shriek, I rushed from the margin, and buried my face in my&#10;hands--weeping bitterly.&#10;&#10;The heat rapidly increased, and once again I looked up, shuddering as&#10;with a fit of the ague. There had been a second change in the cell--and&#10;now the change was obviously in the form. As before, it was in vain that&#10;I, at first, endeavoured to appreciate or understand what was taking&#10;place. But not long was I left in doubt. The Inquisitorial vengeance had&#10;been hurried by my two-fold escape, and there was to be no more dallying&#10;with the King of Terrors. The room had been square. I saw that two of&#10;its iron angles were now acute--two, consequently, obtuse. The fearful&#10;difference quickly increased with a low rumbling or moaning sound. In an&#10;instant the apartment had shifted its form into that of a lozenge. But&#10;the alteration stopped not here-I neither hoped nor desired it to stop.&#10;I could have clasped the red walls to my bosom as a garment of eternal&#10;peace. &quot;Death,&quot; I said, &quot;any death but that of the pit!&quot; Fool! might I&#10;have not known that into the pit it was the object of the burning iron&#10;to urge me? Could I resist its glow? or, if even that, could I withstand&#10;its pressure? And now, flatter and flatter grew the lozenge, with a&#10;rapidity that left me no time for contemplation. Its centre, and of&#10;course, its greatest width, came just over the yawning gulf. I shrank&#10;back--but the closing walls pressed me resistlessly onward. At length&#10;for my seared and writhing body there was no longer an inch of foothold&#10;on the firm floor of the prison. I struggled no more, but the agony of&#10;my soul found vent in one loud, long, and final scream of despair. I&#10;felt that I tottered upon the brink--I averted my eyes--&#10;&#10;There was a discordant hum of human voices! There was a loud blast as of&#10;many trumpets! There was a harsh grating as of a thousand thunders! The&#10;fiery walls rushed back! An outstretched arm caught my own as I fell,&#10;fainting, into the abyss. It was that of General Lasalle. The French&#10;army had entered Toledo. The Inquisition was in the hands of its&#10;enemies.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;THE PREMATURE BURIAL&#10;&#10;THERE are certain themes of which the interest is all-absorbing, but&#10;which are too entirely horrible for the purposes of legitimate fiction.&#10;These the mere romanticist must eschew, if he do not wish to offend or&#10;to disgust. They are with propriety handled only when the severity and&#10;majesty of Truth sanctify and sustain them. We thrill, for example, with&#10;the most intense of &quot;pleasurable pain&quot; over the accounts of the Passage&#10;of the Beresina, of the Earthquake at Lisbon, of the Plague at London,&#10;of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, or of the stifling of the hundred&#10;and twenty-three prisoners in the Black Hole at Calcutta. But in these&#10;accounts it is the fact----it is the reality----it is the history which&#10;excites. As inventions, we should regard them with simple abhorrence.&#10;&#10;I have mentioned some few of the more prominent and august calamities&#10;on record; but in these it is the extent, not less than the character&#10;of the calamity, which so vividly impresses the fancy. I need not remind&#10;the reader that, from the long and weird catalogue of human miseries,&#10;I might have selected many individual instances more replete with&#10;essential suffering than any of these vast generalities of disaster.&#10;The true wretchedness, indeed--the ultimate woe----is particular, not&#10;diffuse. That the ghastly extremes of agony are endured by man the unit,&#10;and never by man the mass----for this let us thank a merciful God!&#10;&#10;To be buried while alive is, beyond question, the most terrific of these&#10;extremes which has ever fallen to the lot of mere mortality. That it has&#10;frequently, very frequently, so fallen will scarcely be denied by those&#10;who think. The boundaries which divide Life from Death are at best&#10;shadowy and vague. Who shall say where the one ends, and where the other&#10;begins? We know that there are diseases in which occur total cessations&#10;of all the apparent functions of vitality, and yet in which these&#10;cessations are merely suspensions, properly so called. They are only&#10;temporary pauses in the incomprehensible mechanism. A certain period&#10;elapses, and some unseen mysterious principle again sets in motion the&#10;magic pinions and the wizard wheels. The silver cord was not for ever&#10;loosed, nor the golden bowl irreparably broken. But where, meantime, was&#10;the soul?&#10;&#10;Apart, however, from the inevitable conclusion, a priori that such&#10;causes must produce such effects----that the well-known occurrence of&#10;such cases of suspended animation must naturally give rise, now and&#10;then, to premature interments--apart from this consideration, we have&#10;the direct testimony of medical and ordinary experience to prove that a&#10;vast number of such interments have actually taken place. I might refer&#10;at once, if necessary to a hundred well authenticated instances. One of&#10;very remarkable character, and of which the circumstances may be fresh&#10;in the memory of some of my readers, occurred, not very long ago, in the&#10;neighboring city of Baltimore, where it occasioned a painful, intense,&#10;and widely-extended excitement. The wife of one of the most respectable&#10;citizens--a lawyer of eminence and a member of Congress--was seized with&#10;a sudden and unaccountable illness, which completely baffled the skill&#10;of her physicians. After much suffering she died, or was supposed to&#10;die. No one suspected, indeed, or had reason to suspect, that she was&#10;not actually dead. She presented all the ordinary appearances of death.&#10;The face assumed the usual pinched and sunken outline. The lips were of&#10;the usual marble pallor. The eyes were lustreless. There was no warmth.&#10;Pulsation had ceased. For three days the body was preserved unburied,&#10;during which it had acquired a stony rigidity. The funeral, in short,&#10;was hastened, on account of the rapid advance of what was supposed to be&#10;decomposition.&#10;&#10;The lady was deposited in her family vault, which, for three subsequent&#10;years, was undisturbed. At the expiration of this term it was opened&#10;for the reception of a sarcophagus;----but, alas! how fearful a shock&#10;awaited the husband, who, personally, threw open the door! As its&#10;portals swung outwardly back, some white-apparelled object fell rattling&#10;within his arms. It was the skeleton of his wife in her yet unmoulded&#10;shroud.&#10;&#10;A careful investigation rendered it evident that she had revived within&#10;two days after her entombment; that her struggles within the coffin had&#10;caused it to fall from a ledge, or shelf to the floor, where it was so&#10;broken as to permit her escape. A lamp which had been accidentally&#10;left, full of oil, within the tomb, was found empty; it might have been&#10;exhausted, however, by evaporation. On the uttermost of the steps which&#10;led down into the dread chamber was a large fragment of the coffin,&#10;with which, it seemed, that she had endeavored to arrest attention by&#10;striking the iron door. While thus occupied, she probably swooned, or&#10;possibly died, through sheer terror; and, in failing, her shroud became&#10;entangled in some iron--work which projected interiorly. Thus she&#10;remained, and thus she rotted, erect.&#10;&#10;In the year 1810, a case of living inhumation happened in France,&#10;attended with circumstances which go far to warrant the assertion that&#10;truth is, indeed, stranger than fiction. The heroine of the story was a&#10;Mademoiselle Victorine Lafourcade, a young girl of illustrious family,&#10;of wealth, and of great personal beauty. Among her numerous suitors was&#10;Julien Bossuet, a poor litterateur, or journalist of Paris. His talents&#10;and general amiability had recommended him to the notice of the heiress,&#10;by whom he seems to have been truly beloved; but her pride of birth&#10;decided her, finally, to reject him, and to wed a Monsieur Renelle, a&#10;banker and a diplomatist of some eminence. After marriage, however, this&#10;gentleman neglected, and, perhaps, even more positively ill-treated her.&#10;Having passed with him some wretched years, she died,----at least her&#10;condition so closely resembled death as to deceive every one who saw&#10;her. She was buried----not in a vault, but in an ordinary grave in the&#10;village of her nativity. Filled with despair, and still inflamed by the&#10;memory of a profound attachment, the lover journeys from the capital to&#10;the remote province in which the village lies, with the romantic purpose&#10;of disinterring the corpse, and possessing himself of its luxuriant&#10;tresses. He reaches the grave. At midnight he unearths the coffin, opens&#10;it, and is in the act of detaching the hair, when he is arrested by the&#10;unclosing of the beloved eyes. In fact, the lady had been buried&#10;alive. Vitality had not altogether departed, and she was aroused by&#10;the caresses of her lover from the lethargy which had been mistaken&#10;for death. He bore her frantically to his lodgings in the village. He&#10;employed certain powerful restoratives suggested by no little medical&#10;learning. In fine, she revived. She recognized her preserver. She&#10;remained with him until, by slow degrees, she fully recovered her&#10;original health. Her woman's heart was not adamant, and this last&#10;lesson of love sufficed to soften it. She bestowed it upon Bossuet.&#10;She returned no more to her husband, but, concealing from him her&#10;resurrection, fled with her lover to America. Twenty years afterward,&#10;the two returned to France, in the persuasion that time had so greatly&#10;altered the lady's appearance that her friends would be unable to&#10;recognize her. They were mistaken, however, for, at the first meeting,&#10;Monsieur Renelle did actually recognize and make claim to his wife.&#10;This claim she resisted, and a judicial tribunal sustained her in her&#10;resistance, deciding that the peculiar circumstances, with the long&#10;lapse of years, had extinguished, not only equitably, but legally, the&#10;authority of the husband.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Chirurgical Journal&quot; of Leipsic--a periodical of high authority&#10;and merit, which some American bookseller would do well to translate&#10;and republish, records in a late number a very distressing event of the&#10;character in question.&#10;&#10;An officer of artillery, a man of gigantic stature and of robust&#10;health, being thrown from an unmanageable horse, received a very severe&#10;contusion upon the head, which rendered him insensible at once; the&#10;skull was slightly fractured, but no immediate danger was apprehended.&#10;Trepanning was accomplished successfully. He was bled, and many other of&#10;the ordinary means of relief were adopted. Gradually, however, he fell&#10;into a more and more hopeless state of stupor, and, finally, it was&#10;thought that he died.&#10;&#10;The weather was warm, and he was buried with indecent haste in one of&#10;the public cemeteries. His funeral took place on Thursday. On the Sunday&#10;following, the grounds of the cemetery were, as usual, much thronged&#10;with visiters, and about noon an intense excitement was created by&#10;the declaration of a peasant that, while sitting upon the grave of&#10;the officer, he had distinctly felt a commotion of the earth, as if&#10;occasioned by some one struggling beneath. At first little attention was&#10;paid to the man's asseveration; but his evident terror, and the dogged&#10;obstinacy with which he persisted in his story, had at length their&#10;natural effect upon the crowd. Spades were hurriedly procured, and the&#10;grave, which was shamefully shallow, was in a few minutes so far thrown&#10;open that the head of its occupant appeared. He was then seemingly dead;&#10;but he sat nearly erect within his coffin, the lid of which, in his&#10;furious struggles, he had partially uplifted.&#10;&#10;He was forthwith conveyed to the nearest hospital, and there pronounced&#10;to be still living, although in an asphytic condition. After some hours&#10;he revived, recognized individuals of his acquaintance, and, in broken&#10;sentences spoke of his agonies in the grave.&#10;&#10;From what he related, it was clear that he must have been conscious&#10;of life for more than an hour, while inhumed, before lapsing into&#10;insensibility. The grave was carelessly and loosely filled with an&#10;exceedingly porous soil; and thus some air was necessarily admitted.&#10;He heard the footsteps of the crowd overhead, and endeavored to make&#10;himself heard in turn. It was the tumult within the grounds of the&#10;cemetery, he said, which appeared to awaken him from a deep sleep, but&#10;no sooner was he awake than he became fully aware of the awful horrors&#10;of his position.&#10;&#10;This patient, it is recorded, was doing well and seemed to be in a fair&#10;way of ultimate recovery, but fell a victim to the quackeries of medical&#10;experiment. The galvanic battery was applied, and he suddenly expired in&#10;one of those ecstatic paroxysms which, occasionally, it superinduces.&#10;&#10;The mention of the galvanic battery, nevertheless, recalls to my memory&#10;a well known and very extraordinary case in point, where its action&#10;proved the means of restoring to animation a young attorney of London,&#10;who had been interred for two days. This occurred in 1831, and created,&#10;at the time, a very profound sensation wherever it was made the subject&#10;of converse.&#10;&#10;The patient, Mr. Edward Stapleton, had died, apparently of typhus fever,&#10;accompanied with some anomalous symptoms which had excited the curiosity&#10;of his medical attendants. Upon his seeming decease, his friends were&#10;requested to sanction a post-mortem examination, but declined to permit&#10;it. As often happens, when such refusals are made, the practitioners&#10;resolved to disinter the body and dissect it at leisure, in private.&#10;Arrangements were easily effected with some of the numerous corps of&#10;body-snatchers, with which London abounds; and, upon the third night&#10;after the funeral, the supposed corpse was unearthed from a grave eight&#10;feet deep, and deposited in the opening chamber of one of the private&#10;hospitals.&#10;&#10;An incision of some extent had been actually made in the abdomen,&#10;when the fresh and undecayed appearance of the subject suggested an&#10;application of the battery. One experiment succeeded another, and the&#10;customary effects supervened, with nothing to characterize them in any&#10;respect, except, upon one or two occasions, a more than ordinary degree&#10;of life-likeness in the convulsive action.&#10;&#10;It grew late. The day was about to dawn; and it was thought expedient,&#10;at length, to proceed at once to the dissection. A student, however, was&#10;especially desirous of testing a theory of his own, and insisted upon&#10;applying the battery to one of the pectoral muscles. A rough gash was&#10;made, and a wire hastily brought in contact, when the patient, with a&#10;hurried but quite unconvulsive movement, arose from the table, stepped&#10;into the middle of the floor, gazed about him uneasily for a few&#10;seconds, and then--spoke. What he said was unintelligible, but words&#10;were uttered; the syllabification was distinct. Having spoken, he fell&#10;heavily to the floor.&#10;&#10;For some moments all were paralyzed with awe--but the urgency of the&#10;case soon restored them their presence of mind. It was seen that Mr.&#10;Stapleton was alive, although in a swoon. Upon exhibition of ether he&#10;revived and was rapidly restored to health, and to the society of his&#10;friends--from whom, however, all knowledge of his resuscitation was&#10;withheld, until a relapse was no longer to be apprehended. Their&#10;wonder--their rapturous astonishment--may be conceived.&#10;&#10;The most thrilling peculiarity of this incident, nevertheless, is&#10;involved in what Mr. S. himself asserts. He declares that at no period&#10;was he altogether insensible--that, dully and confusedly, he was aware&#10;of everything which happened to him, from the moment in which he was&#10;pronounced dead by his physicians, to that in which he fell swooning to&#10;the floor of the hospital. &quot;I am alive,&quot; were the uncomprehended words&#10;which, upon recognizing the locality of the dissecting-room, he had&#10;endeavored, in his extremity, to utter.&#10;&#10;It were an easy matter to multiply such histories as these--but I&#10;forbear--for, indeed, we have no need of such to establish the fact that&#10;premature interments occur. When we reflect how very rarely, from the&#10;nature of the case, we have it in our power to detect them, we must&#10;admit that they may frequently occur without our cognizance. Scarcely,&#10;in truth, is a graveyard ever encroached upon, for any purpose, to any&#10;great extent, that skeletons are not found in postures which suggest the&#10;most fearful of suspicions.&#10;&#10;Fearful indeed the suspicion--but more fearful the doom! It may be&#10;asserted, without hesitation, that no event is so terribly well adapted&#10;to inspire the supremeness of bodily and of mental distress, as is&#10;burial before death. The unendurable oppression of the lungs--the&#10;stifling fumes from the damp earth--the clinging to the death&#10;garments--the rigid embrace of the narrow house--the blackness of the&#10;absolute Night--the silence like a sea that overwhelms--the unseen but&#10;palpable presence of the Conqueror Worm--these things, with the thoughts&#10;of the air and grass above, with memory of dear friends who would fly to&#10;save us if but informed of our fate, and with consciousness that of this&#10;fate they can never be informed--that our hopeless portion is that of&#10;the really dead--these considerations, I say, carry into the heart,&#10;which still palpitates, a degree of appalling and intolerable horror&#10;from which the most daring imagination must recoil. We know of nothing&#10;so agonizing upon Earth--we can dream of nothing half so hideous in the&#10;realms of the nethermost Hell. And thus all narratives upon this topic&#10;have an interest profound; an interest, nevertheless, which, through&#10;the sacred awe of the topic itself, very properly and very peculiarly&#10;depends upon our conviction of the truth of the matter narrated. What I&#10;have now to tell is of my own actual knowledge--of my own positive and&#10;personal experience.&#10;&#10;For several years I had been subject to attacks of the singular disorder&#10;which physicians have agreed to term catalepsy, in default of a more&#10;definitive title. Although both the immediate and the predisposing&#10;causes, and even the actual diagnosis, of this disease are still&#10;mysterious, its obvious and apparent character is sufficiently well&#10;understood. Its variations seem to be chiefly of degree. Sometimes the&#10;patient lies, for a day only, or even for a shorter period, in a species&#10;of exaggerated lethargy. He is senseless and externally motionless; but&#10;the pulsation of the heart is still faintly perceptible; some traces of&#10;warmth remain; a slight color lingers within the centre of the cheek;&#10;and, upon application of a mirror to the lips, we can detect a torpid,&#10;unequal, and vacillating action of the lungs. Then again the duration&#10;of the trance is for weeks--even for months; while the closest scrutiny,&#10;and the most rigorous medical tests, fail to establish any material&#10;distinction between the state of the sufferer and what we conceive of&#10;absolute death. Very usually he is saved from premature interment solely&#10;by the knowledge of his friends that he has been previously subject to&#10;catalepsy, by the consequent suspicion excited, and, above all, by&#10;the non-appearance of decay. The advances of the malady are, luckily,&#10;gradual. The first manifestations, although marked, are unequivocal. The&#10;fits grow successively more and more distinctive, and endure each for a&#10;longer term than the preceding. In this lies the principal security from&#10;inhumation. The unfortunate whose first attack should be of the extreme&#10;character which is occasionally seen, would almost inevitably be&#10;consigned alive to the tomb.&#10;&#10;My own case differed in no important particular from those mentioned in&#10;medical books. Sometimes, without any apparent cause, I sank, little by&#10;little, into a condition of hemi-syncope, or half swoon; and, in this&#10;condition, without pain, without ability to stir, or, strictly speaking,&#10;to think, but with a dull lethargic consciousness of life and of the&#10;presence of those who surrounded my bed, I remained, until the crisis of&#10;the disease restored me, suddenly, to perfect sensation. At other&#10;times I was quickly and impetuously smitten. I grew sick, and numb, and&#10;chilly, and dizzy, and so fell prostrate at once. Then, for weeks, all&#10;was void, and black, and silent, and Nothing became the universe.&#10;Total annihilation could be no more. From these latter attacks I awoke,&#10;however, with a gradation slow in proportion to the suddenness of the&#10;seizure. Just as the day dawns to the friendless and houseless beggar&#10;who roams the streets throughout the long desolate winter night--just&#10;so tardily--just so wearily--just so cheerily came back the light of the&#10;Soul to me.&#10;&#10;Apart from the tendency to trance, however, my general health appeared&#10;to be good; nor could I perceive that it was at all affected by the one&#10;prevalent malady--unless, indeed, an idiosyncrasy in my ordinary sleep&#10;may be looked upon as superinduced. Upon awaking from slumber, I could&#10;never gain, at once, thorough possession of my senses, and always&#10;remained, for many minutes, in much bewilderment and perplexity;--the&#10;mental faculties in general, but the memory in especial, being in a&#10;condition of absolute abeyance.&#10;&#10;In all that I endured there was no physical suffering but of moral&#10;distress an infinitude. My fancy grew charnel, I talked &quot;of worms, of&#10;tombs, and epitaphs.&quot; I was lost in reveries of death, and the idea&#10;of premature burial held continual possession of my brain. The ghastly&#10;Danger to which I was subjected haunted me day and night. In the former,&#10;the torture of meditation was excessive--in the latter, supreme. When&#10;the grim Darkness overspread the Earth, then, with every horror of&#10;thought, I shook--shook as the quivering plumes upon the hearse. When&#10;Nature could endure wakefulness no longer, it was with a struggle that&#10;I consented to sleep--for I shuddered to reflect that, upon awaking, I&#10;might find myself the tenant of a grave. And when, finally, I sank into&#10;slumber, it was only to rush at once into a world of phantasms, above&#10;which, with vast, sable, overshadowing wing, hovered, predominant, the&#10;one sepulchral Idea.&#10;&#10;From the innumerable images of gloom which thus oppressed me in dreams,&#10;I select for record but a solitary vision. Methought I was immersed in&#10;a cataleptic trance of more than usual duration and profundity. Suddenly&#10;there came an icy hand upon my forehead, and an impatient, gibbering&#10;voice whispered the word &quot;Arise!&quot; within my ear.&#10;&#10;I sat erect. The darkness was total. I could not see the figure of him&#10;who had aroused me. I could call to mind neither the period at which I&#10;had fallen into the trance, nor the locality in which I then lay. While&#10;I remained motionless, and busied in endeavors to collect my thought,&#10;the cold hand grasped me fiercely by the wrist, shaking it petulantly,&#10;while the gibbering voice said again:&#10;&#10;&quot;Arise! did I not bid thee arise?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And who,&quot; I demanded, &quot;art thou?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have no name in the regions which I inhabit,&quot; replied the voice,&#10;mournfully; &quot;I was mortal, but am fiend. I was merciless, but am&#10;pitiful. Thou dost feel that I shudder.--My teeth chatter as I speak,&#10;yet it is not with the chilliness of the night--of the night without&#10;end. But this hideousness is insufferable. How canst thou tranquilly&#10;sleep? I cannot rest for the cry of these great agonies. These sights&#10;are more than I can bear. Get thee up! Come with me into the outer&#10;Night, and let me unfold to thee the graves. Is not this a spectacle of&#10;woe?--Behold!&quot;&#10;&#10;I looked; and the unseen figure, which still grasped me by the wrist,&#10;had caused to be thrown open the graves of all mankind, and from each&#10;issued the faint phosphoric radiance of decay, so that I could see into&#10;the innermost recesses, and there view the shrouded bodies in their&#10;sad and solemn slumbers with the worm. But alas! the real sleepers were&#10;fewer, by many millions, than those who slumbered not at all; and there&#10;was a feeble struggling; and there was a general sad unrest; and from&#10;out the depths of the countless pits there came a melancholy rustling&#10;from the garments of the buried. And of those who seemed tranquilly&#10;to repose, I saw that a vast number had changed, in a greater or less&#10;degree, the rigid and uneasy position in which they had originally been&#10;entombed. And the voice again said to me as I gazed:&#10;&#10;&quot;Is it not--oh! is it not a pitiful sight?&quot;--but, before I could find&#10;words to reply, the figure had ceased to grasp my wrist, the phosphoric&#10;lights expired, and the graves were closed with a sudden violence, while&#10;from out them arose a tumult of despairing cries, saying again: &quot;Is it&#10;not--O, God, is it not a very pitiful sight?&quot;&#10;&#10;Phantasies such as these, presenting themselves at night, extended their&#10;terrific influence far into my waking hours. My nerves became thoroughly&#10;unstrung, and I fell a prey to perpetual horror. I hesitated to ride, or&#10;to walk, or to indulge in any exercise that would carry me from home.&#10;In fact, I no longer dared trust myself out of the immediate presence&#10;of those who were aware of my proneness to catalepsy, lest, falling into&#10;one of my usual fits, I should be buried before my real condition could&#10;be ascertained. I doubted the care, the fidelity of my dearest friends.&#10;I dreaded that, in some trance of more than customary duration, they&#10;might be prevailed upon to regard me as irrecoverable. I even went so&#10;far as to fear that, as I occasioned much trouble, they might be glad to&#10;consider any very protracted attack as sufficient excuse for getting rid&#10;of me altogether. It was in vain they endeavored to reassure me by the&#10;most solemn promises. I exacted the most sacred oaths, that under no&#10;circumstances they would bury me until decomposition had so materially&#10;advanced as to render farther preservation impossible. And, even&#10;then, my mortal terrors would listen to no reason--would accept no&#10;consolation. I entered into a series of elaborate precautions. Among&#10;other things, I had the family vault so remodelled as to admit of being&#10;readily opened from within. The slightest pressure upon a long lever&#10;that extended far into the tomb would cause the iron portal to fly back.&#10;There were arrangements also for the free admission of air and light,&#10;and convenient receptacles for food and water, within immediate reach of&#10;the coffin intended for my reception. This coffin was warmly and softly&#10;padded, and was provided with a lid, fashioned upon the principle of the&#10;vault-door, with the addition of springs so contrived that the feeblest&#10;movement of the body would be sufficient to set it at liberty. Besides&#10;all this, there was suspended from the roof of the tomb, a large bell,&#10;the rope of which, it was designed, should extend through a hole in the&#10;coffin, and so be fastened to one of the hands of the corpse. But, alas?&#10;what avails the vigilance against the Destiny of man? Not even these&#10;well-contrived securities sufficed to save from the uttermost agonies of&#10;living inhumation, a wretch to these agonies foredoomed!&#10;&#10;There arrived an epoch--as often before there had arrived--in which I&#10;found myself emerging from total unconsciousness into the first&#10;feeble and indefinite sense of existence. Slowly--with a tortoise&#10;gradation--approached the faint gray dawn of the psychal day. A torpid&#10;uneasiness. An apathetic endurance of dull pain. No care--no hope--no&#10;effort. Then, after a long interval, a ringing in the ears; then,&#10;after a lapse still longer, a prickling or tingling sensation in the&#10;extremities; then a seemingly eternal period of pleasurable quiescence,&#10;during which the awakening feelings are struggling into thought; then a&#10;brief re-sinking into non-entity; then a sudden recovery. At length the&#10;slight quivering of an eyelid, and immediately thereupon, an electric&#10;shock of a terror, deadly and indefinite, which sends the blood in&#10;torrents from the temples to the heart. And now the first positive&#10;effort to think. And now the first endeavor to remember. And now a&#10;partial and evanescent success. And now the memory has so far regained&#10;its dominion, that, in some measure, I am cognizant of my state. I feel&#10;that I am not awaking from ordinary sleep. I recollect that I have been&#10;subject to catalepsy. And now, at last, as if by the rush of an ocean,&#10;my shuddering spirit is overwhelmed by the one grim Danger--by the one&#10;spectral and ever-prevalent idea.&#10;&#10;For some minutes after this fancy possessed me, I remained without&#10;motion. And why? I could not summon courage to move. I dared not&#10;make the effort which was to satisfy me of my fate--and yet there was&#10;something at my heart which whispered me it was sure. Despair--such as&#10;no other species of wretchedness ever calls into being--despair alone&#10;urged me, after long irresolution, to uplift the heavy lids of my eyes.&#10;I uplifted them. It was dark--all dark. I knew that the fit was over. I&#10;knew that the crisis of my disorder had long passed. I knew that I&#10;had now fully recovered the use of my visual faculties--and yet it was&#10;dark--all dark--the intense and utter raylessness of the Night that&#10;endureth for evermore.&#10;&#10;I endeavored to shriek; and my lips and my parched tongue moved&#10;convulsively together in the attempt--but no voice issued from the&#10;cavernous lungs, which oppressed as if by the weight of some incumbent&#10;mountain, gasped and palpitated, with the heart, at every elaborate and&#10;struggling inspiration.&#10;&#10;The movement of the jaws, in this effort to cry aloud, showed me that&#10;they were bound up, as is usual with the dead. I felt, too, that I lay&#10;upon some hard substance, and by something similar my sides were,&#10;also, closely compressed. So far, I had not ventured to stir any of my&#10;limbs--but now I violently threw up my arms, which had been lying at&#10;length, with the wrists crossed. They struck a solid wooden substance,&#10;which extended above my person at an elevation of not more than six&#10;inches from my face. I could no longer doubt that I reposed within a&#10;coffin at last.&#10;&#10;And now, amid all my infinite miseries, came sweetly the cherub&#10;Hope--for I thought of my precautions. I writhed, and made spasmodic&#10;exertions to force open the lid: it would not move. I felt my wrists for&#10;the bell-rope: it was not to be found. And now the Comforter fled for&#10;ever, and a still sterner Despair reigned triumphant; for I could not&#10;help perceiving the absence of the paddings which I had so carefully&#10;prepared--and then, too, there came suddenly to my nostrils the strong&#10;peculiar odor of moist earth. The conclusion was irresistible. I was&#10;not within the vault. I had fallen into a trance while absent from&#10;home--while among strangers--when, or how, I could not remember--and&#10;it was they who had buried me as a dog--nailed up in some common&#10;coffin--and thrust deep, deep, and for ever, into some ordinary and&#10;nameless grave.&#10;&#10;As this awful conviction forced itself, thus, into the innermost&#10;chambers of my soul, I once again struggled to cry aloud. And in this&#10;second endeavor I succeeded. A long, wild, and continuous shriek, or&#10;yell of agony, resounded through the realms of the subterranean Night.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hillo! hillo, there!&quot; said a gruff voice, in reply.&#10;&#10;&quot;What the devil's the matter now!&quot; said a second.&#10;&#10;&quot;Get out o' that!&quot; said a third.&#10;&#10;&quot;What do you mean by yowling in that ere kind of style, like a&#10;cattymount?&quot; said a fourth; and hereupon I was seized and shaken&#10;without ceremony, for several minutes, by a junto of very rough-looking&#10;individuals. They did not arouse me from my slumber--for I was wide&#10;awake when I screamed--but they restored me to the full possession of my&#10;memory.&#10;&#10;This adventure occurred near Richmond, in Virginia. Accompanied by a&#10;friend, I had proceeded, upon a gunning expedition, some miles down the&#10;banks of the James River. Night approached, and we were overtaken by&#10;a storm. The cabin of a small sloop lying at anchor in the stream, and&#10;laden with garden mould, afforded us the only available shelter. We made&#10;the best of it, and passed the night on board. I slept in one of the&#10;only two berths in the vessel--and the berths of a sloop of sixty or&#10;twenty tons need scarcely be described. That which I occupied had no&#10;bedding of any kind. Its extreme width was eighteen inches. The distance&#10;of its bottom from the deck overhead was precisely the same. I found it&#10;a matter of exceeding difficulty to squeeze myself in. Nevertheless, I&#10;slept soundly, and the whole of my vision--for it was no dream, and no&#10;nightmare--arose naturally from the circumstances of my position--from&#10;my ordinary bias of thought--and from the difficulty, to which I have&#10;alluded, of collecting my senses, and especially of regaining my memory,&#10;for a long time after awaking from slumber. The men who shook me were&#10;the crew of the sloop, and some laborers engaged to unload it. From the&#10;load itself came the earthly smell. The bandage about the jaws was a&#10;silk handkerchief in which I had bound up my head, in default of my&#10;customary nightcap.&#10;&#10;The tortures endured, however, were indubitably quite equal for the&#10;time, to those of actual sepulture. They were fearfully--they were&#10;inconceivably hideous; but out of Evil proceeded Good; for their very&#10;excess wrought in my spirit an inevitable revulsion. My soul acquired&#10;tone--acquired temper. I went abroad. I took vigorous exercise. I&#10;breathed the free air of Heaven. I thought upon other subjects than&#10;Death. I discarded my medical books. &quot;Buchan&quot; I burned. I read no &quot;Night&#10;Thoughts&quot;--no fustian about churchyards--no bugaboo tales--such as&#10;this. In short, I became a new man, and lived a man's life. From that&#10;memorable night, I dismissed forever my charnel apprehensions, and with&#10;them vanished the cataleptic disorder, of which, perhaps, they had been&#10;less the consequence than the cause.&#10;&#10;There are moments when, even to the sober eye of Reason, the world of&#10;our sad Humanity may assume the semblance of a Hell--but the imagination&#10;of man is no Carathis, to explore with impunity its every cavern. Alas!&#10;the grim legion of sepulchral terrors cannot be regarded as altogether&#10;fanciful--but, like the Demons in whose company Afrasiab made his voyage&#10;down the Oxus, they must sleep, or they will devour us--they must be&#10;suffered to slumber, or we perish.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;THE DOMAIN OF ARNHEIM&#10;&#10;     The garden like a lady fair was cut,&#10;     That lay as if she slumbered in delight,&#10;     And to the open skies her eyes did shut.&#10;     The azure fields of Heaven were 'sembled right&#10;     In a large round, set with the flowers of light.&#10;     The flowers de luce, and the round sparks of dew.&#10;     That hung upon their azure leaves did shew&#10;     Like twinkling stars that sparkle in the evening blue.&#10;     Giles Fletcher.&#10;&#10;FROM his cradle to his grave a gale of prosperity bore my friend Ellison&#10;along. Nor do I use the word prosperity in its mere worldly sense. I&#10;mean it as synonymous with happiness. The person of whom I speak seemed&#10;born for the purpose of foreshadowing the doctrines of Turgot, Price,&#10;Priestley, and Condorcet--of exemplifying by individual instance&#10;what has been deemed the chimera of the perfectionists. In the brief&#10;existence of Ellison I fancy that I have seen refuted the dogma, that in&#10;man's very nature lies some hidden principle, the antagonist of bliss.&#10;An anxious examination of his career has given me to understand that in&#10;general, from the violation of a few simple laws of humanity arises the&#10;wretchedness of mankind--that as a species we have in our possession the&#10;as yet unwrought elements of content--and that, even now, in the present&#10;darkness and madness of all thought on the great question of the social&#10;condition, it is not impossible that man, the individual, under certain&#10;unusual and highly fortuitous conditions, may be happy.&#10;&#10;With opinions such as these my young friend, too, was fully imbued, and&#10;thus it is worthy of observation that the uninterrupted enjoyment which&#10;distinguished his life was, in great measure, the result of preconcert.&#10;It is indeed evident that with less of the instinctive philosophy which,&#10;now and then, stands so well in the stead of experience, Mr. Ellison&#10;would have found himself precipitated, by the very extraordinary success&#10;of his life, into the common vortex of unhappiness which yawns for those&#10;of pre-eminent endowments. But it is by no means my object to pen an&#10;essay on happiness. The ideas of my friend may be summed up in a few&#10;words. He admitted but four elementary principles, or more strictly,&#10;conditions of bliss. That which he considered chief was (strange to&#10;say!) the simple and purely physical one of free exercise in the open&#10;air. &quot;The health,&quot; he said, &quot;attainable by other means is scarcely worth&#10;the name.&quot; He instanced the ecstasies of the fox-hunter, and pointed to&#10;the tillers of the earth, the only people who, as a class, can be fairly&#10;considered happier than others. His second condition was the love of&#10;woman. His third, and most difficult of realization, was the contempt&#10;of ambition. His fourth was an object of unceasing pursuit; and he held&#10;that, other things being equal, the extent of attainable happiness was&#10;in proportion to the spirituality of this object.&#10;&#10;Ellison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of good gifts&#10;lavished upon him by fortune. In personal grace and beauty he exceeded&#10;all men. His intellect was of that order to which the acquisition of&#10;knowledge is less a labor than an intuition and a necessity. His&#10;family was one of the most illustrious of the empire. His bride was the&#10;loveliest and most devoted of women. His possessions had been always&#10;ample; but on the attainment of his majority, it was discovered that&#10;one of those extraordinary freaks of fate had been played in his behalf&#10;which startle the whole social world amid which they occur, and seldom&#10;fail radically to alter the moral constitution of those who are their&#10;objects.&#10;&#10;It appears that about a hundred years before Mr. Ellison's coming of&#10;age, there had died, in a remote province, one Mr. Seabright Ellison.&#10;This gentleman had amassed a princely fortune, and, having no immediate&#10;connections, conceived the whim of suffering his wealth to accumulate&#10;for a century after his decease. Minutely and sagaciously directing the&#10;various modes of investment, he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the&#10;nearest of blood, bearing the name of Ellison, who should be alive at&#10;the end of the hundred years. Many attempts had been made to set aside&#10;this singular bequest; their ex post facto character rendered them&#10;abortive; but the attention of a jealous government was aroused, and a&#10;legislative act finally obtained, forbidding all similar accumulations.&#10;This act, however, did not prevent young Ellison from entering into&#10;possession, on his twenty-first birthday, as the heir of his ancestor&#10;Seabright, of a fortune of four hundred and fifty millions of dollars.&#10;(*1)&#10;&#10;When it had become known that such was the enormous wealth inherited,&#10;there were, of course, many speculations as to the mode of its disposal.&#10;The magnitude and the immediate availability of the sum bewildered all&#10;who thought on the topic. The possessor of any appreciable amount of&#10;money might have been imagined to perform any one of a thousand things.&#10;With riches merely surpassing those of any citizen, it would have&#10;been easy to suppose him engaging to supreme excess in the fashionable&#10;extravagances of his time--or busying himself with political&#10;intrigue--or aiming at ministerial power--or purchasing increase&#10;of nobility--or collecting large museums of virtu--or playing the&#10;munificent patron of letters, of science, of art--or endowing, and&#10;bestowing his name upon extensive institutions of charity. But for the&#10;inconceivable wealth in the actual possession of the heir, these objects&#10;and all ordinary objects were felt to afford too limited a field.&#10;Recourse was had to figures, and these but sufficed to confound. It was&#10;seen that, even at three per cent., the annual income of the inheritance&#10;amounted to no less than thirteen millions and five hundred thousand&#10;dollars; which was one million and one hundred and twenty-five thousand&#10;per month; or thirty-six thousand nine hundred and eighty-six per day;&#10;or one thousand five hundred and forty-one per hour; or six and twenty&#10;dollars for every minute that flew. Thus the usual track of supposition&#10;was thoroughly broken up. Men knew not what to imagine. There were some&#10;who even conceived that Mr. Ellison would divest himself of at least&#10;one-half of his fortune, as of utterly superfluous opulence--enriching&#10;whole troops of his relatives by division of his superabundance. To the&#10;nearest of these he did, in fact, abandon the very unusual wealth which&#10;was his own before the inheritance.&#10;&#10;I was not surprised, however, to perceive that he had long made up his&#10;mind on a point which had occasioned so much discussion to his friends.&#10;Nor was I greatly astonished at the nature of his decision. In regard to&#10;individual charities he had satisfied his conscience. In the possibility&#10;of any improvement, properly so called, being effected by man himself in&#10;the general condition of man, he had (I am sorry to confess it) little&#10;faith. Upon the whole, whether happily or unhappily, he was thrown back,&#10;in very great measure, upon self.&#10;&#10;In the widest and noblest sense he was a poet. He comprehended,&#10;moreover, the true character, the august aims, the supreme majesty and&#10;dignity of the poetic sentiment. The fullest, if not the sole proper&#10;satisfaction of this sentiment he instinctively felt to lie in the&#10;creation of novel forms of beauty. Some peculiarities, either in his&#10;early education, or in the nature of his intellect, had tinged with&#10;what is termed materialism all his ethical speculations; and it was this&#10;bias, perhaps, which led him to believe that the most advantageous at&#10;least, if not the sole legitimate field for the poetic exercise, lies&#10;in the creation of novel moods of purely physical loveliness. Thus it&#10;happened he became neither musician nor poet--if we use this latter term&#10;in its every-day acceptation. Or it might have been that he neglected&#10;to become either, merely in pursuance of his idea that in contempt of&#10;ambition is to be found one of the essential principles of happiness on&#10;earth. Is it not indeed, possible that, while a high order of genius&#10;is necessarily ambitious, the highest is above that which is termed&#10;ambition? And may it not thus happen that many far greater than Milton&#10;have contentedly remained &quot;mute and inglorious?&quot; I believe that the&#10;world has never seen--and that, unless through some series of accidents&#10;goading the noblest order of mind into distasteful exertion, the world&#10;will never see--that full extent of triumphant execution, in the richer&#10;domains of art, of which the human nature is absolutely capable.&#10;&#10;Ellison became neither musician nor poet; although no man lived more&#10;profoundly enamored of music and poetry. Under other circumstances than&#10;those which invested him, it is not impossible that he would have become&#10;a painter. Sculpture, although in its nature rigorously poetical was too&#10;limited in its extent and consequences, to have occupied, at any time,&#10;much of his attention. And I have now mentioned all the provinces in&#10;which the common understanding of the poetic sentiment has declared it&#10;capable of expatiating. But Ellison maintained that the richest, the&#10;truest, and most natural, if not altogether the most extensive province,&#10;had been unaccountably neglected. No definition had spoken of the&#10;landscape-gardener as of the poet; yet it seemed to my friend that the&#10;creation of the landscape-garden offered to the proper Muse the most&#10;magnificent of opportunities. Here, indeed, was the fairest field for&#10;the display of imagination in the endless combining of forms of&#10;novel beauty; the elements to enter into combination being, by a vast&#10;superiority, the most glorious which the earth could afford. In the&#10;multiform and multicolor of the flowers and the trees, he recognised the&#10;most direct and energetic efforts of Nature at physical loveliness. And&#10;in the direction or concentration of this effort--or, more properly,&#10;in its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it on earth--he&#10;perceived that he should be employing the best means--laboring to the&#10;greatest advantage--in the fulfilment, not only of his own destiny as&#10;poet, but of the august purposes for which the Deity had implanted the&#10;poetic sentiment in man.&#10;&#10;&quot;Its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it on earth.&quot; In his&#10;explanation of this phraseology, Mr. Ellison did much toward solving&#10;what has always seemed to me an enigma:--I mean the fact (which none&#10;but the ignorant dispute) that no such combination of scenery exists in&#10;nature as the painter of genius may produce. No such paradises are to&#10;be found in reality as have glowed on the canvas of Claude. In the most&#10;enchanting of natural landscapes, there will always be found a defect&#10;or an excess--many excesses and defects. While the component parts may&#10;defy, individually, the highest skill of the artist, the arrangement&#10;of these parts will always be susceptible of improvement. In short, no&#10;position can be attained on the wide surface of the natural earth,&#10;from which an artistical eye, looking steadily, will not find matter of&#10;offence in what is termed the &quot;composition&quot; of the landscape. And&#10;yet how unintelligible is this! In all other matters we are justly&#10;instructed to regard nature as supreme. With her details we shrink from&#10;competition. Who shall presume to imitate the colors of the tulip, or to&#10;improve the proportions of the lily of the valley? The criticism which&#10;says, of sculpture or portraiture, that here nature is to be exalted or&#10;idealized rather than imitated, is in error. No pictorial or sculptural&#10;combinations of points of human liveliness do more than approach the&#10;living and breathing beauty. In landscape alone is the principle of the&#10;critic true; and, having felt its truth here, it is but the headlong&#10;spirit of generalization which has led him to pronounce it true&#10;throughout all the domains of art. Having, I say, felt its truth here;&#10;for the feeling is no affectation or chimera. The mathematics afford no&#10;more absolute demonstrations than the sentiments of his art yields the&#10;artist. He not only believes, but positively knows, that such and&#10;such apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter constitute and alone&#10;constitute the true beauty. His reasons, however, have not yet been&#10;matured into expression. It remains for a more profound analysis&#10;than the world has yet seen, fully to investigate and express them.&#10;Nevertheless he is confirmed in his instinctive opinions by the voice of&#10;all his brethren. Let a &quot;composition&quot; be defective; let an emendation&#10;be wrought in its mere arrangement of form; let this emendation be&#10;submitted to every artist in the world; by each will its necessity&#10;be admitted. And even far more than this:--in remedy of the defective&#10;composition, each insulated member of the fraternity would have&#10;suggested the identical emendation.&#10;&#10;I repeat that in landscape arrangements alone is the physical nature&#10;susceptible of exaltation, and that, therefore, her susceptibility of&#10;improvement at this one point, was a mystery I had been unable to solve.&#10;My own thoughts on the subject had rested in the idea that the primitive&#10;intention of nature would have so arranged the earth's surface as to&#10;have fulfilled at all points man's sense of perfection in the beautiful,&#10;the sublime, or the picturesque; but that this primitive intention had&#10;been frustrated by the known geological disturbances--disturbances of&#10;form and color--grouping, in the correction or allaying of which lies&#10;the soul of art. The force of this idea was much weakened, however, by&#10;the necessity which it involved of considering the disturbances abnormal&#10;and unadapted to any purpose. It was Ellison who suggested that&#10;they were prognostic of death. He thus explained:--Admit the earthly&#10;immortality of man to have been the first intention. We have then the&#10;primitive arrangement of the earth's surface adapted to his blissful&#10;estate, as not existent but designed. The disturbances were the&#10;preparations for his subsequently conceived deathful condition.&#10;&#10;&quot;Now,&quot; said my friend, &quot;what we regard as exaltation of the landscape&#10;may be really such, as respects only the moral or human point of view.&#10;Each alteration of the natural scenery may possibly effect a blemish&#10;in the picture, if we can suppose this picture viewed at large--in&#10;mass--from some point distant from the earth's surface, although not&#10;beyond the limits of its atmosphere. It is easily understood that what&#10;might improve a closely scrutinized detail, may at the same time injure&#10;a general or more distantly observed effect. There may be a class of&#10;beings, human once, but now invisible to humanity, to whom, from afar,&#10;our disorder may seem order--our unpicturesqueness picturesque, in a&#10;word, the earth-angels, for whose scrutiny more especially than our own,&#10;and for whose death-refined appreciation of the beautiful, may have&#10;been set in array by God the wide landscape-gardens of the hemispheres.&quot;&#10;&#10;In the course of discussion, my friend quoted some passages from a&#10;writer on landscape-gardening who has been supposed to have well treated&#10;his theme:&#10;&#10;&quot;There are properly but two styles of landscape-gardening, the natural&#10;and the artificial. One seeks to recall the original beauty of the&#10;country, by adapting its means to the surrounding scenery, cultivating&#10;trees in harmony with the hills or plain of the neighboring land;&#10;detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size,&#10;proportion, and color which, hid from the common observer, are revealed&#10;everywhere to the experienced student of nature. The result of the&#10;natural style of gardening, is seen rather in the absence of all&#10;defects and incongruities--in the prevalence of a healthy harmony and&#10;order--than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles. The&#10;artificial style has as many varieties as there are different tastes&#10;to gratify. It has a certain general relation to the various styles of&#10;building. There are the stately avenues and retirements of Versailles;&#10;Italian terraces; and a various mixed old English style, which&#10;bears some relation to the domestic Gothic or English Elizabethan&#10;architecture. Whatever may be said against the abuses of the artificial&#10;landscape-gardening, a mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it&#10;a great beauty. This is partly pleasing to the eye, by the show of&#10;order and design, and partly moral. A terrace, with an old moss-covered&#10;balustrade, calls up at once to the eye the fair forms that have passed&#10;there in other days. The slightest exhibition of art is an evidence of&#10;care and human interest.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;From what I have already observed,&quot; said Ellison, &quot;you will understand&#10;that I reject the idea, here expressed, of recalling the original beauty&#10;of the country. The original beauty is never so great as that which may&#10;be introduced. Of course, every thing depends on the selection of a&#10;spot with capabilities. What is said about detecting and bringing into&#10;practice nice relations of size, proportion, and color, is one of those&#10;mere vaguenesses of speech which serve to veil inaccuracy of thought.&#10;The phrase quoted may mean any thing, or nothing, and guides in no&#10;degree. That the true result of the natural style of gardening is seen&#10;rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities than in the&#10;creation of any special wonders or miracles, is a proposition better&#10;suited to the grovelling apprehension of the herd than to the fervid&#10;dreams of the man of genius. The negative merit suggested appertains to&#10;that hobbling criticism which, in letters, would elevate Addison into&#10;apotheosis. In truth, while that virtue which consists in the mere&#10;avoidance of vice appeals directly to the understanding, and can thus be&#10;circumscribed in rule, the loftier virtue, which flames in creation, can&#10;be apprehended in its results alone. Rule applies but to the merits of&#10;denial--to the excellencies which refrain. Beyond these, the critical&#10;art can but suggest. We may be instructed to build a &quot;Cato,&quot; but we&#10;are in vain told how to conceive a Parthenon or an &quot;Inferno.&quot; The&#10;thing done, however; the wonder accomplished; and the capacity for&#10;apprehension becomes universal. The sophists of the negative school who,&#10;through inability to create, have scoffed at creation, are now found&#10;the loudest in applause. What, in its chrysalis condition of principle,&#10;affronted their demure reason, never fails, in its maturity of&#10;accomplishment, to extort admiration from their instinct of beauty.&#10;&#10;&quot;The author's observations on the artificial style,&quot; continued Ellison,&#10;&quot;are less objectionable. A mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to&#10;it a great beauty. This is just; as also is the reference to the sense&#10;of human interest. The principle expressed is incontrovertible--but&#10;there may be something beyond it. There may be an object in keeping with&#10;the principle--an object unattainable by the means ordinarily possessed&#10;by individuals, yet which, if attained, would lend a charm to the&#10;landscape-garden far surpassing that which a sense of merely human&#10;interest could bestow. A poet, having very unusual pecuniary resources,&#10;might, while retaining the necessary idea of art or culture, or, as&#10;our author expresses it, of interest, so imbue his designs at once with&#10;extent and novelty of beauty, as to convey the sentiment of spiritual&#10;interference. It will be seen that, in bringing about such result, he&#10;secures all the advantages of interest or design, while relieving his&#10;work of the harshness or technicality of the worldly art. In the&#10;most rugged of wildernesses--in the most savage of the scenes of pure&#10;nature--there is apparent the art of a creator; yet this art is apparent&#10;to reflection only; in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling.&#10;Now let us suppose this sense of the Almighty design to be one step&#10;depressed--to be brought into something like harmony or consistency with&#10;the sense of human art--to form an intermedium between the two:--let&#10;us imagine, for example, a landscape whose combined vastness and&#10;definitiveness--whose united beauty, magnificence, and strangeness,&#10;shall convey the idea of care, or culture, or superintendence, on the&#10;part of beings superior, yet akin to humanity--then the sentiment of&#10;interest is preserved, while the art intervolved is made to assume the&#10;air of an intermediate or secondary nature--a nature which is not God,&#10;nor an emanation from God, but which still is nature in the sense of the&#10;handiwork of the angels that hover between man and God.&quot;&#10;&#10;It was in devoting his enormous wealth to the embodiment of a vision&#10;such as this--in the free exercise in the open air ensured by the&#10;personal superintendence of his plans--in the unceasing object which&#10;these plans afforded--in the high spirituality of the object--in&#10;the contempt of ambition which it enabled him truly to feel--in the&#10;perennial springs with which it gratified, without possibility of&#10;satiating, that one master passion of his soul, the thirst for beauty,&#10;above all, it was in the sympathy of a woman, not unwomanly, whose&#10;loveliness and love enveloped his existence in the purple atmosphere of&#10;Paradise, that Ellison thought to find, and found, exemption from&#10;the ordinary cares of humanity, with a far greater amount of positive&#10;happiness than ever glowed in the rapt day-dreams of De Stael.&#10;&#10;I despair of conveying to the reader any distinct conception of the&#10;marvels which my friend did actually accomplish. I wish to describe, but&#10;am disheartened by the difficulty of description, and hesitate between&#10;detail and generality. Perhaps the better course will be to unite the&#10;two in their extremes.&#10;&#10;Mr. Ellison's first step regarded, of course, the choice of a locality,&#10;and scarcely had he commenced thinking on this point, when the luxuriant&#10;nature of the Pacific Islands arrested his attention. In fact, he&#10;had made up his mind for a voyage to the South Seas, when a night's&#10;reflection induced him to abandon the idea. &quot;Were I misanthropic,&quot; he&#10;said, &quot;such a locale would suit me. The thoroughness of its insulation&#10;and seclusion, and the difficulty of ingress and egress, would in such&#10;case be the charm of charms; but as yet I am not Timon. I wish the&#10;composure but not the depression of solitude. There must remain with me&#10;a certain control over the extent and duration of my repose. There will&#10;be frequent hours in which I shall need, too, the sympathy of the poetic&#10;in what I have done. Let me seek, then, a spot not far from a populous&#10;city--whose vicinity, also, will best enable me to execute my plans.&quot;&#10;&#10;In search of a suitable place so situated, Ellison travelled for several&#10;years, and I was permitted to accompany him. A thousand spots with&#10;which I was enraptured he rejected without hesitation, for reasons which&#10;satisfied me, in the end, that he was right. We came at length to an&#10;elevated table-land of wonderful fertility and beauty, affording a&#10;panoramic prospect very little less in extent than that of Aetna, and,&#10;in Ellison's opinion as well as my own, surpassing the far-famed view&#10;from that mountain in all the true elements of the picturesque.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am aware,&quot; said the traveller, as he drew a sigh of deep delight&#10;after gazing on this scene, entranced, for nearly an hour, &quot;I know that&#10;here, in my circumstances, nine-tenths of the most fastidious of men&#10;would rest content. This panorama is indeed glorious, and I should&#10;rejoice in it but for the excess of its glory. The taste of all the&#10;architects I have ever known leads them, for the sake of 'prospect,' to&#10;put up buildings on hill-tops. The error is obvious. Grandeur in any of&#10;its moods, but especially in that of extent, startles, excites--and then&#10;fatigues, depresses. For the occasional scene nothing can be better--for&#10;the constant view nothing worse. And, in the constant view, the most&#10;objectionable phase of grandeur is that of extent; the worst phase of&#10;extent, that of distance. It is at war with the sentiment and with the&#10;sense of seclusion--the sentiment and sense which we seek to humor in&#10;'retiring to the country.' In looking from the summit of a mountain we&#10;cannot help feeling abroad in the world. The heart-sick avoid distant&#10;prospects as a pestilence.&quot;&#10;&#10;It was not until toward the close of the fourth year of our search that&#10;we found a locality with which Ellison professed himself satisfied. It&#10;is, of course, needless to say where was the locality. The late death of&#10;my friend, in causing his domain to be thrown open to certain classes&#10;of visiters, has given to Arnheim a species of secret and subdued if&#10;not solemn celebrity, similar in kind, although infinitely superior in&#10;degree, to that which so long distinguished Fonthill.&#10;&#10;The usual approach to Arnheim was by the river. The visiter left the&#10;city in the early morning. During the forenoon he passed between shores&#10;of a tranquil and domestic beauty, on which grazed innumerable sheep,&#10;their white fleeces spotting the vivid green of rolling meadows. By&#10;degrees the idea of cultivation subsided into that of merely pastoral&#10;care. This slowly became merged in a sense of retirement--this again in&#10;a consciousness of solitude. As the evening approached, the channel grew&#10;more narrow, the banks more and more precipitous; and these latter&#10;were clothed in rich, more profuse, and more sombre foliage. The water&#10;increased in transparency. The stream took a thousand turns, so that at&#10;no moment could its gleaming surface be seen for a greater distance&#10;than a furlong. At every instant the vessel seemed imprisoned within an&#10;enchanted circle, having insuperable and impenetrable walls of foliage,&#10;a roof of ultramarine satin, and no floor--the keel balancing itself&#10;with admirable nicety on that of a phantom bark which, by some accident&#10;having been turned upside down, floated in constant company with the&#10;substantial one, for the purpose of sustaining it. The channel now&#10;became a gorge--although the term is somewhat inapplicable, and I employ&#10;it merely because the language has no word which better represents&#10;the most striking--not the most distinctive--feature of the scene. The&#10;character of gorge was maintained only in the height and parallelism of&#10;the shores; it was lost altogether in their other traits. The walls of&#10;the ravine (through which the clear water still tranquilly flowed) arose&#10;to an elevation of a hundred and occasionally of a hundred and fifty&#10;feet, and inclined so much toward each other as, in a great measure, to&#10;shut out the light of day; while the long plume-like moss which depended&#10;densely from the intertwining shrubberies overhead, gave the whole&#10;chasm an air of funereal gloom. The windings became more frequent and&#10;intricate, and seemed often as if returning in upon themselves, so&#10;that the voyager had long lost all idea of direction. He was, moreover,&#10;enwrapt in an exquisite sense of the strange. The thought of nature&#10;still remained, but her character seemed to have undergone modification,&#10;there was a weird symmetry, a thrilling uniformity, a wizard propriety&#10;in these her works. Not a dead branch--not a withered leaf--not a stray&#10;pebble--not a patch of the brown earth was anywhere visible. The crystal&#10;water welled up against the clean granite, or the unblemished moss, with&#10;a sharpness of outline that delighted while it bewildered the eye.&#10;&#10;Having threaded the mazes of this channel for some hours, the gloom&#10;deepening every moment, a sharp and unexpected turn of the vessel&#10;brought it suddenly, as if dropped from heaven, into a circular basin of&#10;very considerable extent when compared with the width of the gorge. It&#10;was about two hundred yards in diameter, and girt in at all points but&#10;one--that immediately fronting the vessel as it entered--by hills equal&#10;in general height to the walls of the chasm, although of a thoroughly&#10;different character. Their sides sloped from the water's edge at an&#10;angle of some forty-five degrees, and they were clothed from base to&#10;summit--not a perceptible point escaping--in a drapery of the most&#10;gorgeous flower-blossoms; scarcely a green leaf being visible among the&#10;sea of odorous and fluctuating color. This basin was of great depth, but&#10;so transparent was the water that the bottom, which seemed to consist of&#10;a thick mass of small round alabaster pebbles, was distinctly visible&#10;by glimpses--that is to say, whenever the eye could permit itself not&#10;to see, far down in the inverted heaven, the duplicate blooming of the&#10;hills. On these latter there were no trees, nor even shrubs of any size.&#10;The impressions wrought on the observer were those of richness,&#10;warmth, color, quietude, uniformity, softness, delicacy, daintiness,&#10;voluptuousness, and a miraculous extremeness of culture that suggested&#10;dreams of a new race of fairies, laborious, tasteful, magnificent, and&#10;fastidious; but as the eye traced upward the myriad-tinted slope, from&#10;its sharp junction with the water to its vague termination amid the&#10;folds of overhanging cloud, it became, indeed, difficult not to fancy&#10;a panoramic cataract of rubies, sapphires, opals, and golden onyxes,&#10;rolling silently out of the sky.&#10;&#10;The visiter, shooting suddenly into this bay from out the gloom of the&#10;ravine, is delighted but astounded by the full orb of the declining sun,&#10;which he had supposed to be already far below the horizon, but which now&#10;confronts him, and forms the sole termination of an otherwise limitless&#10;vista seen through another chasm-like rift in the hills.&#10;&#10;But here the voyager quits the vessel which has borne him so far, and&#10;descends into a light canoe of ivory, stained with arabesque devices in&#10;vivid scarlet, both within and without. The poop and beak of this boat&#10;arise high above the water, with sharp points, so that the general form&#10;is that of an irregular crescent. It lies on the surface of the bay&#10;with the proud grace of a swan. On its ermined floor reposes a single&#10;feathery paddle of satin-wood; but no oarsmen or attendant is to be&#10;seen. The guest is bidden to be of good cheer--that the fates will take&#10;care of him. The larger vessel disappears, and he is left alone in the&#10;canoe, which lies apparently motionless in the middle of the lake.&#10;While he considers what course to pursue, however, he becomes aware of a&#10;gentle movement in the fairy bark. It slowly swings itself around until&#10;its prow points toward the sun. It advances with a gentle but gradually&#10;accelerated velocity, while the slight ripples it creates seem to break&#10;about the ivory side in divinest melody-seem to offer the only possible&#10;explanation of the soothing yet melancholy music for whose unseen origin&#10;the bewildered voyager looks around him in vain.&#10;&#10;The canoe steadily proceeds, and the rocky gate of the vista is&#10;approached, so that its depths can be more distinctly seen. To the&#10;right arise a chain of lofty hills rudely and luxuriantly wooded. It is&#10;observed, however, that the trait of exquisite cleanness where the bank&#10;dips into the water, still prevails. There is not one token of the usual&#10;river debris. To the left the character of the scene is softer and more&#10;obviously artificial. Here the bank slopes upward from the stream in&#10;a very gentle ascent, forming a broad sward of grass of a texture&#10;resembling nothing so much as velvet, and of a brilliancy of green which&#10;would bear comparison with the tint of the purest emerald. This plateau&#10;varies in width from ten to three hundred yards; reaching from the&#10;river-bank to a wall, fifty feet high, which extends, in an infinity of&#10;curves, but following the general direction of the river, until lost in&#10;the distance to the westward. This wall is of one continuous rock, and&#10;has been formed by cutting perpendicularly the once rugged precipice of&#10;the stream's southern bank, but no trace of the labor has been suffered&#10;to remain. The chiselled stone has the hue of ages, and is profusely&#10;overhung and overspread with the ivy, the coral honeysuckle, the&#10;eglantine, and the clematis. The uniformity of the top and bottom lines&#10;of the wall is fully relieved by occasional trees of gigantic height,&#10;growing singly or in small groups, both along the plateau and in the&#10;domain behind the wall, but in close proximity to it; so that frequent&#10;limbs (of the black walnut especially) reach over and dip their pendent&#10;extremities into the water. Farther back within the domain, the vision&#10;is impeded by an impenetrable screen of foliage.&#10;&#10;These things are observed during the canoe's gradual approach to what I&#10;have called the gate of the vista. On drawing nearer to this, however,&#10;its chasm-like appearance vanishes; a new outlet from the bay is&#10;discovered to the left--in which direction the wall is also seen to&#10;sweep, still following the general course of the stream. Down this new&#10;opening the eye cannot penetrate very far; for the stream, accompanied&#10;by the wall, still bends to the left, until both are swallowed up by the&#10;leaves.&#10;&#10;The boat, nevertheless, glides magically into the winding channel; and&#10;here the shore opposite the wall is found to resemble that opposite&#10;the wall in the straight vista. Lofty hills, rising occasionally into&#10;mountains, and covered with vegetation in wild luxuriance, still shut in&#10;the scene.&#10;&#10;Floating gently onward, but with a velocity slightly augmented, the&#10;voyager, after many short turns, finds his progress apparently barred by&#10;a gigantic gate or rather door of burnished gold, elaborately carved and&#10;fretted, and reflecting the direct rays of the now fast-sinking sun&#10;with an effulgence that seems to wreath the whole surrounding forest in&#10;flames. This gate is inserted in the lofty wall; which here appears to&#10;cross the river at right angles. In a few moments, however, it is seen&#10;that the main body of the water still sweeps in a gentle and extensive&#10;curve to the left, the wall following it as before, while a stream of&#10;considerable volume, diverging from the principal one, makes its way,&#10;with a slight ripple, under the door, and is thus hidden from sight.&#10;The canoe falls into the lesser channel and approaches the gate. Its&#10;ponderous wings are slowly and musically expanded. The boat glides&#10;between them, and commences a rapid descent into a vast amphitheatre&#10;entirely begirt with purple mountains, whose bases are laved by a&#10;gleaming river throughout the full extent of their circuit. Meantime&#10;the whole Paradise of Arnheim bursts upon the view. There is a gush&#10;of entrancing melody; there is an oppressive sense of strange sweet&#10;odor,--there is a dream-like intermingling to the eye of tall&#10;slender Eastern trees--bosky shrubberies--flocks of golden and crimson&#10;birds--lily-fringed lakes--meadows of violets, tulips, poppies,&#10;hyacinths, and tuberoses--long intertangled lines of silver&#10;streamlets--and, upspringing confusedly from amid all, a mass of&#10;semi-Gothic, semi-Saracenic architecture sustaining itself by miracle in&#10;mid-air, glittering in the red sunlight with a hundred oriels, minarets,&#10;and pinnacles; and seeming the phantom handiwork, conjointly, of the&#10;Sylphs, of the Fairies, of the Genii and of the Gnomes.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;LANDOR'S COTTAGE&#10;&#10;     A Pendant to &quot;The Domain of Arnheim&quot;&#10;&#10;DURING A pedestrian trip last summer, through one or two of the river&#10;counties of New York, I found myself, as the day declined, somewhat&#10;embarrassed about the road I was pursuing. The land undulated very&#10;remarkably; and my path, for the last hour, had wound about and about so&#10;confusedly, in its effort to keep in the valleys, that I no longer knew&#10;in what direction lay the sweet village of B----, where I had determined&#10;to stop for the night. The sun had scarcely shone--strictly&#10;speaking--during the day, which nevertheless, had been unpleasantly&#10;warm. A smoky mist, resembling that of the Indian summer, enveloped all&#10;things, and of course, added to my uncertainty. Not that I cared much&#10;about the matter. If I did not hit upon the village before sunset,&#10;or even before dark, it was more than possible that a little&#10;Dutch farmhouse, or something of that kind, would soon make its&#10;appearance--although, in fact, the neighborhood (perhaps on account of&#10;being more picturesque than fertile) was very sparsely inhabited. At&#10;all events, with my knapsack for a pillow, and my hound as a sentry, a&#10;bivouac in the open air was just the thing which would have amused me.&#10;I sauntered on, therefore, quite at ease--Ponto taking charge of my&#10;gun--until at length, just as I had begun to consider whether the&#10;numerous little glades that led hither and thither, were intended to&#10;be paths at all, I was conducted by one of them into an unquestionable&#10;carriage track. There could be no mistaking it. The traces of light&#10;wheels were evident; and although the tall shrubberies and overgrown&#10;undergrowth met overhead, there was no obstruction whatever below, even&#10;to the passage of a Virginian mountain wagon--the most aspiring vehicle,&#10;I take it, of its kind. The road, however, except in being open through&#10;the wood--if wood be not too weighty a name for such an assemblage of&#10;light trees--and except in the particulars of evident wheel-tracks--bore&#10;no resemblance to any road I had before seen. The tracks of which I&#10;speak were but faintly perceptible--having been impressed upon the firm,&#10;yet pleasantly moist surface of--what looked more like green Genoese&#10;velvet than any thing else. It was grass, clearly--but grass such as we&#10;seldom see out of England--so short, so thick, so even, and so vivid in&#10;color. Not a single impediment lay in the wheel-route--not even a chip&#10;or dead twig. The stones that once obstructed the way had been carefully&#10;placed--not thrown-along the sides of the lane, so as to define its&#10;boundaries at bottom with a kind of half-precise, half-negligent, and&#10;wholly picturesque definition. Clumps of wild flowers grew everywhere,&#10;luxuriantly, in the interspaces.&#10;&#10;What to make of all this, of course I knew not. Here was art&#10;undoubtedly--that did not surprise me--all roads, in the ordinary sense,&#10;are works of art; nor can I say that there was much to wonder at in the&#10;mere excess of art manifested; all that seemed to have been done, might&#10;have been done here--with such natural &quot;capabilities&quot; (as they have&#10;it in the books on Landscape Gardening)--with very little labor and&#10;expense. No; it was not the amount but the character of the art which&#10;caused me to take a seat on one of the blossomy stones and gaze up and&#10;down this fairy-like avenue for half an hour or more in bewildered&#10;admiration. One thing became more and more evident the longer I&#10;gazed: an artist, and one with a most scrupulous eye for form, had&#10;superintended all these arrangements. The greatest care had been taken&#10;to preserve a due medium between the neat and graceful on the one hand,&#10;and the pittoresque, in the true sense of the Italian term, on the&#10;other. There were few straight, and no long uninterrupted lines. The&#10;same effect of curvature or of color appeared twice, usually, but not&#10;oftener, at any one point of view. Everywhere was variety in uniformity.&#10;It was a piece of &quot;composition,&quot; in which the most fastidiously critical&#10;taste could scarcely have suggested an emendation.&#10;&#10;I had turned to the right as I entered this road, and now, arising, I&#10;continued in the same direction. The path was so serpentine, that at&#10;no moment could I trace its course for more than two or three paces in&#10;advance. Its character did not undergo any material change.&#10;&#10;Presently the murmur of water fell gently upon my ear--and in a few&#10;moments afterward, as I turned with the road somewhat more abruptly than&#10;hitherto, I became aware that a building of some kind lay at the foot&#10;of a gentle declivity just before me. I could see nothing distinctly on&#10;account of the mist which occupied all the little valley below. A gentle&#10;breeze, however, now arose, as the sun was about descending; and while&#10;I remained standing on the brow of the slope, the fog gradually became&#10;dissipated into wreaths, and so floated over the scene.&#10;&#10;As it came fully into view--thus gradually as I describe it--piece by&#10;piece, here a tree, there a glimpse of water, and here again the summit&#10;of a chimney, I could scarcely help fancying that the whole was one of&#10;the ingenious illusions sometimes exhibited under the name of &quot;vanishing&#10;pictures.&quot;&#10;&#10;By the time, however, that the fog had thoroughly disappeared, the sun&#10;had made its way down behind the gentle hills, and thence, as if with&#10;a slight chassez to the south, had come again fully into sight, glaring&#10;with a purplish lustre through a chasm that entered the valley from the&#10;west. Suddenly, therefore--and as if by the hand of magic--this whole&#10;valley and every thing in it became brilliantly visible.&#10;&#10;The first coup d'oeil, as the sun slid into the position described,&#10;impressed me very much as I have been impressed, when a boy, by&#10;the concluding scene of some well-arranged theatrical spectacle or&#10;melodrama. Not even the monstrosity of color was wanting; for the&#10;sunlight came out through the chasm, tinted all orange and purple; while&#10;the vivid green of the grass in the valley was reflected more or less&#10;upon all objects from the curtain of vapor that still hung overhead,&#10;as if loth to take its total departure from a scene so enchantingly&#10;beautiful.&#10;&#10;The little vale into which I thus peered down from under the fog canopy&#10;could not have been more than four hundred yards long; while in breadth&#10;it varied from fifty to one hundred and fifty or perhaps two hundred.&#10;It was most narrow at its northern extremity, opening out as it tended&#10;southwardly, but with no very precise regularity. The widest portion&#10;was within eighty yards of the southern extreme. The slopes which&#10;encompassed the vale could not fairly be called hills, unless at their&#10;northern face. Here a precipitous ledge of granite arose to a height of&#10;some ninety feet; and, as I have mentioned, the valley at this point was&#10;not more than fifty feet wide; but as the visiter proceeded southwardly&#10;from the cliff, he found on his right hand and on his left, declivities&#10;at once less high, less precipitous, and less rocky. All, in a word,&#10;sloped and softened to the south; and yet the whole vale was engirdled&#10;by eminences, more or less high, except at two points. One of these I&#10;have already spoken of. It lay considerably to the north of west, and&#10;was where the setting sun made its way, as I have before described, into&#10;the amphitheatre, through a cleanly cut natural cleft in the granite&#10;embankment; this fissure might have been ten yards wide at its widest&#10;point, so far as the eye could trace it. It seemed to lead up, up like a&#10;natural causeway, into the recesses of unexplored mountains and forests.&#10;The other opening was directly at the southern end of the vale. Here,&#10;generally, the slopes were nothing more than gentle inclinations,&#10;extending from east to west about one hundred and fifty yards. In the&#10;middle of this extent was a depression, level with the ordinary floor of&#10;the valley. As regards vegetation, as well as in respect to every thing&#10;else, the scene softened and sloped to the south. To the north--on the&#10;craggy precipice--a few paces from the verge--up sprang the magnificent&#10;trunks of numerous hickories, black walnuts, and chestnuts, interspersed&#10;with occasional oak, and the strong lateral branches thrown out by the&#10;walnuts especially, spread far over the edge of the cliff. Proceeding&#10;southwardly, the explorer saw, at first, the same class of trees,&#10;but less and less lofty and Salvatorish in character; then he saw the&#10;gentler elm, succeeded by the sassafras and locust--these again by the&#10;softer linden, red-bud, catalpa, and maple--these yet again by still&#10;more graceful and more modest varieties. The whole face of the southern&#10;declivity was covered with wild shrubbery alone--an occasional&#10;silver willow or white poplar excepted. In the bottom of the valley&#10;itself--(for it must be borne in mind that the vegetation hitherto&#10;mentioned grew only on the cliffs or hillsides)--were to be seen three&#10;insulated trees. One was an elm of fine size and exquisite form: it&#10;stood guard over the southern gate of the vale. Another was a hickory,&#10;much larger than the elm, and altogether a much finer tree, although&#10;both were exceedingly beautiful: it seemed to have taken charge of the&#10;northwestern entrance, springing from a group of rocks in the very jaws&#10;of the ravine, and throwing its graceful body, at an angle of nearly&#10;forty-five degrees, far out into the sunshine of the amphitheatre. About&#10;thirty yards east of this tree stood, however, the pride of the valley,&#10;and beyond all question the most magnificent tree I have ever seen,&#10;unless, perhaps, among the cypresses of the Itchiatuckanee. It was a&#10;triple-stemmed tulip-tree--the Liriodendron Tulipiferum--one of the&#10;natural order of magnolias. Its three trunks separated from the parent&#10;at about three feet from the soil, and diverging very slightly and&#10;gradually, were not more than four feet apart at the point where the&#10;largest stem shot out into foliage: this was at an elevation of about&#10;eighty feet. The whole height of the principal division was one hundred&#10;and twenty feet. Nothing can surpass in beauty the form, or the glossy,&#10;vivid green of the leaves of the tulip-tree. In the present instance&#10;they were fully eight inches wide; but their glory was altogether&#10;eclipsed by the gorgeous splendor of the profuse blossoms. Conceive,&#10;closely congregated, a million of the largest and most resplendent&#10;tulips! Only thus can the reader get any idea of the picture I would&#10;convey. And then the stately grace of the clean, delicately-granulated&#10;columnar stems, the largest four feet in diameter, at twenty from the&#10;ground. The innumerable blossoms, mingling with those of other trees&#10;scarcely less beautiful, although infinitely less majestic, filled the&#10;valley with more than Arabian perfumes.&#10;&#10;The general floor of the amphitheatre was grass of the same character as&#10;that I had found in the road; if anything, more deliciously soft, thick,&#10;velvety, and miraculously green. It was hard to conceive how all this&#10;beauty had been attained.&#10;&#10;I have spoken of two openings into the vale. From the one to the&#10;northwest issued a rivulet, which came, gently murmuring and slightly&#10;foaming, down the ravine, until it dashed against the group of rocks out&#10;of which sprang the insulated hickory. Here, after encircling the tree,&#10;it passed on a little to the north of east, leaving the tulip tree some&#10;twenty feet to the south, and making no decided alteration in its course&#10;until it came near the midway between the eastern and western boundaries&#10;of the valley. At this point, after a series of sweeps, it turned off at&#10;right angles and pursued a generally southern direction meandering as it&#10;went--until it became lost in a small lake of irregular figure (although&#10;roughly oval), that lay gleaming near the lower extremity of the vale.&#10;This lakelet was, perhaps, a hundred yards in diameter at its widest&#10;part. No crystal could be clearer than its waters. Its bottom, which&#10;could be distinctly seen, consisted altogether, of pebbles brilliantly&#10;white. Its banks, of the emerald grass already described, rounded,&#10;rather than sloped, off into the clear heaven below; and so clear was&#10;this heaven, so perfectly, at times, did it reflect all objects above&#10;it, that where the true bank ended and where the mimic one commenced,&#10;it was a point of no little difficulty to determine. The trout, and&#10;some other varieties of fish, with which this pond seemed to be almost&#10;inconveniently crowded, had all the appearance of veritable flying-fish.&#10;It was almost impossible to believe that they were not absolutely&#10;suspended in the air. A light birch canoe that lay placidly on the&#10;water, was reflected in its minutest fibres with a fidelity unsurpassed&#10;by the most exquisitely polished mirror. A small island, fairly laughing&#10;with flowers in full bloom, and affording little more space than just&#10;enough for a picturesque little building, seemingly a fowl-house--arose&#10;from the lake not far from its northern shore--to which it was connected&#10;by means of an inconceivably light-looking and yet very primitive&#10;bridge. It was formed of a single, broad and thick plank of the tulip&#10;wood. This was forty feet long, and spanned the interval between shore&#10;and shore with a slight but very perceptible arch, preventing all&#10;oscillation. From the southern extreme of the lake issued a continuation&#10;of the rivulet, which, after meandering for, perhaps, thirty yards,&#10;finally passed through the &quot;depression&quot; (already described) in the&#10;middle of the southern declivity, and tumbling down a sheer precipice of&#10;a hundred feet, made its devious and unnoticed way to the Hudson.&#10;&#10;The lake was deep--at some points thirty feet--but the rivulet seldom&#10;exceeded three, while its greatest width was about eight. Its bottom and&#10;banks were as those of the pond--if a defect could have been attributed,&#10;in point of picturesqueness, it was that of excessive neatness.&#10;&#10;The expanse of the green turf was relieved, here and there, by an&#10;occasional showy shrub, such as the hydrangea, or the common snowball,&#10;or the aromatic seringa; or, more frequently, by a clump of geraniums&#10;blossoming gorgeously in great varieties. These latter grew in pots&#10;which were carefully buried in the soil, so as to give the plants the&#10;appearance of being indigenous. Besides all this, the lawn's velvet was&#10;exquisitely spotted with sheep--a considerable flock of which roamed&#10;about the vale, in company with three tamed deer, and a vast number of&#10;brilliantly-plumed ducks. A very large mastiff seemed to be in vigilant&#10;attendance upon these animals, each and all.&#10;&#10;Along the eastern and western cliffs--where, toward the upper portion of&#10;the amphitheatre, the boundaries were more or less precipitous--grew ivy&#10;in great profusion--so that only here and there could even a glimpse of&#10;the naked rock be obtained. The northern precipice, in like manner,&#10;was almost entirely clothed by grape-vines of rare luxuriance; some&#10;springing from the soil at the base of the cliff, and others from ledges&#10;on its face.&#10;&#10;The slight elevation which formed the lower boundary of this little&#10;domain, was crowned by a neat stone wall, of sufficient height to&#10;prevent the escape of the deer. Nothing of the fence kind was observable&#10;elsewhere; for nowhere else was an artificial enclosure needed:--any&#10;stray sheep, for example, which should attempt to make its way out of&#10;the vale by means of the ravine, would find its progress arrested,&#10;after a few yards' advance, by the precipitous ledge of rock over which&#10;tumbled the cascade that had arrested my attention as I first drew near&#10;the domain. In short, the only ingress or egress was through a gate&#10;occupying a rocky pass in the road, a few paces below the point at which&#10;I stopped to reconnoitre the scene.&#10;&#10;I have described the brook as meandering very irregularly through the&#10;whole of its course. Its two general directions, as I have said, were&#10;first from west to east, and then from north to south. At the turn, the&#10;stream, sweeping backward, made an almost circular loop, so as to form a&#10;peninsula which was very nearly an island, and which included about the&#10;sixteenth of an acre. On this peninsula stood a dwelling-house--and when&#10;I say that this house, like the infernal terrace seen by Vathek, &quot;etait&#10;d'une architecture inconnue dans les annales de la terre,&quot; I mean,&#10;merely, that its tout ensemble struck me with the keenest sense of&#10;combined novelty and propriety--in a word, of poetry--(for, than in the&#10;words just employed, I could scarcely give, of poetry in the abstract,&#10;a more rigorous definition)--and I do not mean that merely outre was&#10;perceptible in any respect.&#10;&#10;In fact nothing could well be more simple--more utterly unpretending&#10;than this cottage. Its marvellous effect lay altogether in its artistic&#10;arrangement as a picture. I could have fancied, while I looked at it,&#10;that some eminent landscape-painter had built it with his brush.&#10;&#10;The point of view from which I first saw the valley, was not altogether,&#10;although it was nearly, the best point from which to survey the house.&#10;I will therefore describe it as I afterwards saw it--from a position on&#10;the stone wall at the southern extreme of the amphitheatre.&#10;&#10;The main building was about twenty-four feet long and sixteen&#10;broad--certainly not more. Its total height, from the ground to the apex&#10;of the roof, could not have exceeded eighteen feet. To the west end&#10;of this structure was attached one about a third smaller in all its&#10;proportions:--the line of its front standing back about two yards from&#10;that of the larger house, and the line of its roof, of course, being&#10;considerably depressed below that of the roof adjoining. At right angles&#10;to these buildings, and from the rear of the main one--not exactly in&#10;the middle--extended a third compartment, very small--being, in general,&#10;one-third less than the western wing. The roofs of the two larger were&#10;very steep--sweeping down from the ridge-beam with a long concave curve,&#10;and extending at least four feet beyond the walls in front, so as to&#10;form the roofs of two piazzas. These latter roofs, of course, needed&#10;no support; but as they had the air of needing it, slight and perfectly&#10;plain pillars were inserted at the corners alone. The roof of the&#10;northern wing was merely an extension of a portion of the main roof.&#10;Between the chief building and western wing arose a very tall and rather&#10;slender square chimney of hard Dutch bricks, alternately black and&#10;red:--a slight cornice of projecting bricks at the top. Over the gables&#10;the roofs also projected very much:--in the main building about four&#10;feet to the east and two to the west. The principal door was not exactly&#10;in the main division, being a little to the east--while the two windows&#10;were to the west. These latter did not extend to the floor, but were&#10;much longer and narrower than usual--they had single shutters like&#10;doors--the panes were of lozenge form, but quite large. The door itself&#10;had its upper half of glass, also in lozenge panes--a movable shutter&#10;secured it at night. The door to the west wing was in its gable, and&#10;quite simple--a single window looked out to the south. There was no&#10;external door to the north wing, and it also had only one window to the&#10;east.&#10;&#10;The blank wall of the eastern gable was relieved by stairs (with a&#10;balustrade) running diagonally across it--the ascent being from the&#10;south. Under cover of the widely projecting eave these steps gave access&#10;to a door leading to the garret, or rather loft--for it was lighted only&#10;by a single window to the north, and seemed to have been intended as a&#10;store-room.&#10;&#10;The piazzas of the main building and western wing had no floors, as is&#10;usual; but at the doors and at each window, large, flat irregular slabs&#10;of granite lay imbedded in the delicious turf, affording comfortable&#10;footing in all weather. Excellent paths of the same material--not nicely&#10;adapted, but with the velvety sod filling frequent intervals between the&#10;stones, led hither and thither from the house, to a crystal spring about&#10;five paces off, to the road, or to one or two out-houses that lay to&#10;the north, beyond the brook, and were thoroughly concealed by a few&#10;locusts and catalpas.&#10;&#10;Not more than six steps from the main door of the cottage stood the&#10;dead trunk of a fantastic pear-tree, so clothed from head to foot in&#10;the gorgeous bignonia blossoms that one required no little scrutiny to&#10;determine what manner of sweet thing it could be. From various arms of&#10;this tree hung cages of different kinds. In one, a large wicker cylinder&#10;with a ring at top, revelled a mocking bird; in another an oriole; in a&#10;third the impudent bobolink--while three or four more delicate prisons&#10;were loudly vocal with canaries.&#10;&#10;The pillars of the piazza were enwreathed in jasmine and sweet&#10;honeysuckle; while from the angle formed by the main structure and&#10;its west wing, in front, sprang a grape-vine of unexampled luxuriance.&#10;Scorning all restraint, it had clambered first to the lower roof--then&#10;to the higher; and along the ridge of this latter it continued to writhe&#10;on, throwing out tendrils to the right and left, until at length it&#10;fairly attained the east gable, and fell trailing over the stairs.&#10;&#10;The whole house, with its wings, was constructed of the old-fashioned&#10;Dutch shingles--broad, and with unrounded corners. It is a peculiarity&#10;of this material to give houses built of it the appearance of being&#10;wider at bottom than at top--after the manner of Egyptian architecture;&#10;and in the present instance, this exceedingly picturesque effect was&#10;aided by numerous pots of gorgeous flowers that almost encompassed the&#10;base of the buildings.&#10;&#10;The shingles were painted a dull gray; and the happiness with which this&#10;neutral tint melted into the vivid green of the tulip tree leaves that&#10;partially overshadowed the cottage, can readily be conceived by an&#10;artist.&#10;&#10;From the position near the stone wall, as described, the buildings&#10;were seen at great advantage--for the southeastern angle was thrown&#10;forward--so that the eye took in at once the whole of the two fronts,&#10;with the picturesque eastern gable, and at the same time obtained just a&#10;sufficient glimpse of the northern wing, with parts of a pretty roof&#10;to the spring-house, and nearly half of a light bridge that spanned the&#10;brook in the near vicinity of the main buildings.&#10;&#10;I did not remain very long on the brow of the hill, although long enough&#10;to make a thorough survey of the scene at my feet. It was clear that&#10;I had wandered from the road to the village, and I had thus good&#10;traveller's excuse to open the gate before me, and inquire my way, at&#10;all events; so, without more ado, I proceeded.&#10;&#10;The road, after passing the gate, seemed to lie upon a natural ledge,&#10;sloping gradually down along the face of the north-eastern cliffs. It&#10;led me on to the foot of the northern precipice, and thence over the&#10;bridge, round by the eastern gable to the front door. In this progress,&#10;I took notice that no sight of the out-houses could be obtained.&#10;&#10;As I turned the corner of the gable, the mastiff bounded towards me in&#10;stern silence, but with the eye and the whole air of a tiger. I held him&#10;out my hand, however, in token of amity--and I never yet knew the dog&#10;who was proof against such an appeal to his courtesy. He not only&#10;shut his mouth and wagged his tail, but absolutely offered me his&#10;paw--afterward extending his civilities to Ponto.&#10;&#10;As no bell was discernible, I rapped with my stick against the&#10;door, which stood half open. Instantly a figure advanced to the&#10;threshold--that of a young woman about twenty-eight years of&#10;age--slender, or rather slight, and somewhat above the medium height.&#10;As she approached, with a certain modest decision of step altogether&#10;indescribable. I said to myself, &quot;Surely here I have found the&#10;perfection of natural, in contradistinction from artificial grace.&quot; The&#10;second impression which she made on me, but by far the more vivid of&#10;the two, was that of enthusiasm. So intense an expression of romance,&#10;perhaps I should call it, or of unworldliness, as that which gleamed&#10;from her deep-set eyes, had never so sunk into my heart of hearts&#10;before. I know not how it is, but this peculiar expression of the eye,&#10;wreathing itself occasionally into the lips, is the most powerful,&#10;if not absolutely the sole spell, which rivets my interest in woman.&#10;&quot;Romance,&quot; provided my readers fully comprehended what I would here imply&#10;by the word--&quot;romance&quot; and &quot;womanliness&quot; seem to me convertible terms:&#10;and, after all, what man truly loves in woman, is simply her womanhood.&#10;The eyes of Annie (I heard some one from the interior call her &quot;Annie,&#10;darling!&quot;) were &quot;spiritual grey;&quot; her hair, a light chestnut: this is&#10;all I had time to observe of her.&#10;&#10;At her most courteous of invitations, I entered--passing first into a&#10;tolerably wide vestibule. Having come mainly to observe, I took notice&#10;that to my right as I stepped in, was a window, such as those in front&#10;of the house; to the left, a door leading into the principal room;&#10;while, opposite me, an open door enabled me to see a small apartment,&#10;just the size of the vestibule, arranged as a study, and having a large&#10;bow window looking out to the north.&#10;&#10;Passing into the parlor, I found myself with Mr. Landor--for this,&#10;I afterwards found, was his name. He was civil, even cordial in his&#10;manner, but just then, I was more intent on observing the arrangements&#10;of the dwelling which had so much interested me, than the personal&#10;appearance of the tenant.&#10;&#10;The north wing, I now saw, was a bed-chamber, its door opened into the&#10;parlor. West of this door was a single window, looking toward the brook.&#10;At the west end of the parlor, were a fireplace, and a door leading into&#10;the west wing--probably a kitchen.&#10;&#10;Nothing could be more rigorously simple than the furniture of the&#10;parlor. On the floor was an ingrain carpet, of excellent texture--a&#10;white ground, spotted with small circular green figures. At the windows&#10;were curtains of snowy white jaconet muslin: they were tolerably full,&#10;and hung decisively, perhaps rather formally in sharp, parallel plaits&#10;to the floor--just to the floor. The walls were prepared with a French&#10;paper of great delicacy, a silver ground, with a faint green cord&#10;running zig-zag throughout. Its expanse was relieved merely by three&#10;of Julien's exquisite lithographs a trois crayons, fastened to the wall&#10;without frames. One of these drawings was a scene of Oriental luxury, or&#10;rather voluptuousness; another was a &quot;carnival piece,&quot; spirited&#10;beyond compare; the third was a Greek female head--a face so divinely&#10;beautiful, and yet of an expression so provokingly indeterminate, never&#10;before arrested my attention.&#10;&#10;The more substantial furniture consisted of a round table, a few chairs&#10;(including a large rocking-chair), and a sofa, or rather &quot;settee;&quot; its&#10;material was plain maple painted a creamy white, slightly interstriped&#10;with green; the seat of cane. The chairs and table were &quot;to match,&quot; but&#10;the forms of all had evidently been designed by the same brain which&#10;planned &quot;the grounds;&quot; it is impossible to conceive anything more&#10;graceful.&#10;&#10;On the table were a few books, a large, square, crystal bottle of some&#10;novel perfume, a plain ground-glass astral (not solar) lamp with an&#10;Italian shade, and a large vase of resplendently-blooming flowers.&#10;Flowers, indeed, of gorgeous colours and delicate odour formed the sole&#10;mere decoration of the apartment. The fire-place was nearly filled with&#10;a vase of brilliant geranium. On a triangular shelf in each angle of the&#10;room stood also a similar vase, varied only as to its lovely contents.&#10;One or two smaller bouquets adorned the mantel, and late violets&#10;clustered about the open windows.&#10;&#10;It is not the purpose of this work to do more than give in detail, a&#10;picture of Mr. Landor's residence--as I found it. How he made it what it&#10;was--and why--with some particulars of Mr. Landor himself--may, possibly&#10;form the subject of another article.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;WILLIAM WILSON&#10;&#10;    What say of it? what say of CONSCIENCE grim,&#10;    That spectre in my path?&#10;&#10;                   _Chamberlayne's Pharronida._&#10;&#10;LET me call myself, for the present, William Wilson. The fair page now&#10;lying before me need not be sullied with my real appellation. This has&#10;been already too much an object for the scorn--for the horror--for the&#10;detestation of my race. To the uttermost regions of the globe have not&#10;the indignant winds bruited its unparalleled infamy? Oh, outcast of all&#10;outcasts most abandoned!--to the earth art thou not forever dead? to its&#10;honors, to its flowers, to its golden aspirations?--and a cloud, dense,&#10;dismal, and limitless, does it not hang eternally between thy hopes and&#10;heaven?&#10;&#10;I would not, if I could, here or to-day, embody a record of my later&#10;years of unspeakable misery, and unpardonable crime. This epoch--these&#10;later years--took unto themselves a sudden elevation in turpitude, whose&#10;origin alone it is my present purpose to assign. Men usually grow base&#10;by degrees. From me, in an instant, all virtue dropped bodily as a&#10;mantle. From comparatively trivial wickedness I passed, with the stride&#10;of a giant, into more than the enormities of an Elah-Gabalus. What&#10;chance--what one event brought this evil thing to pass, bear with me&#10;while I relate. Death approaches; and the shadow which foreruns him has&#10;thrown a softening influence over my spirit. I long, in passing through&#10;the dim valley, for the sympathy--I had nearly said for the pity--of&#10;my fellow men. I would fain have them believe that I have been, in some&#10;measure, the slave of circumstances beyond human control. I would wish&#10;them to seek out for me, in the details I am about to give, some&#10;little oasis of fatality amid a wilderness of error. I would have them&#10;allow--what they cannot refrain from allowing--that, although temptation&#10;may have erewhile existed as great, man was never thus, at least,&#10;tempted before--certainly, never thus fell. And is it therefore that he&#10;has never thus suffered? Have I not indeed been living in a dream? And&#10;am I not now dying a victim to the horror and the mystery of the wildest&#10;of all sublunary visions?&#10;&#10;I am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily excitable&#10;temperament has at all times rendered them remarkable; and, in my&#10;earliest infancy, I gave evidence of having fully inherited the family&#10;character. As I advanced in years it was more strongly developed;&#10;becoming, for many reasons, a cause of serious disquietude to my&#10;friends, and of positive injury to myself. I grew self-willed, addicted&#10;to the wildest caprices, and a prey to the most ungovernable passions.&#10;Weak-minded, and beset with constitutional infirmities akin to my own,&#10;my parents could do but little to check the evil propensities which&#10;distinguished me. Some feeble and ill-directed efforts resulted in&#10;complete failure on their part, and, of course, in total triumph on&#10;mine. Thenceforward my voice was a household law; and at an age when&#10;few children have abandoned their leading-strings, I was left to the&#10;guidance of my own will, and became, in all but name, the master of my&#10;own actions.&#10;&#10;My earliest recollections of a school-life, are connected with a large,&#10;rambling, Elizabethan house, in a misty-looking village of England,&#10;where were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees, and where all&#10;the houses were excessively ancient. In truth, it was a dream-like&#10;and spirit-soothing place, that venerable old town. At this moment, in&#10;fancy, I feel the refreshing chilliness of its deeply-shadowed avenues,&#10;inhale the fragrance of its thousand shrubberies, and thrill anew&#10;with undefinable delight, at the deep hollow note of the church-bell,&#10;breaking, each hour, with sullen and sudden roar, upon the stillness of&#10;the dusky atmosphere in which the fretted Gothic steeple lay imbedded&#10;and asleep.&#10;&#10;It gives me, perhaps, as much of pleasure as I can now in any manner&#10;experience, to dwell upon minute recollections of the school and its&#10;concerns. Steeped in misery as I am--misery, alas! only too real--I&#10;shall be pardoned for seeking relief, however slight and temporary,&#10;in the weakness of a few rambling details. These, moreover, utterly&#10;trivial, and even ridiculous in themselves, assume, to my fancy,&#10;adventitious importance, as connected with a period and a locality when&#10;and where I recognise the first ambiguous monitions of the destiny which&#10;afterwards so fully overshadowed me. Let me then remember.&#10;&#10;The house, I have said, was old and irregular. The grounds were&#10;extensive, and a high and solid brick wall, topped with a bed of mortar&#10;and broken glass, encompassed the whole. This prison-like rampart formed&#10;the limit of our domain; beyond it we saw but thrice a week--once every&#10;Saturday afternoon, when, attended by two ushers, we were permitted to&#10;take brief walks in a body through some of the neighbouring fields--and&#10;twice during Sunday, when we were paraded in the same formal manner to&#10;the morning and evening service in the one church of the village. Of&#10;this church the principal of our school was pastor. With how deep a&#10;spirit of wonder and perplexity was I wont to regard him from our remote&#10;pew in the gallery, as, with step solemn and slow, he ascended the&#10;pulpit! This reverend man, with countenance so demurely benign,&#10;with robes so glossy and so clerically flowing, with wig so minutely&#10;powdered, so rigid and so vast,---could this be he who, of late, with&#10;sour visage, and in snuffy habiliments, administered, ferule in hand,&#10;the Draconian laws of the academy? Oh, gigantic paradox, too utterly&#10;monstrous for solution!&#10;&#10;At an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate. It was&#10;riveted and studded with iron bolts, and surmounted with jagged iron&#10;spikes. What impressions of deep awe did it inspire! It was never&#10;opened save for the three periodical egressions and ingressions already&#10;mentioned; then, in every creak of its mighty hinges, we found a&#10;plenitude of mystery--a world of matter for solemn remark, or for more&#10;solemn meditation.&#10;&#10;The extensive enclosure was irregular in form, having many capacious&#10;recesses. Of these, three or four of the largest constituted the&#10;play-ground. It was level, and covered with fine hard gravel. I well&#10;remember it had no trees, nor benches, nor anything similar within&#10;it. Of course it was in the rear of the house. In front lay a small&#10;parterre, planted with box and other shrubs; but through this sacred&#10;division we passed only upon rare occasions indeed--such as a first&#10;advent to school or final departure thence, or perhaps, when a parent&#10;or friend having called for us, we joyfully took our way home for the&#10;Christmas or Midsummer holy-days.&#10;&#10;But the house!--how quaint an old building was this!--to me how&#10;veritably a palace of enchantment! There was really no end to its&#10;windings--to its incomprehensible subdivisions. It was difficult, at&#10;any given time, to say with certainty upon which of its two stories&#10;one happened to be. From each room to every other there were sure to be&#10;found three or four steps either in ascent or descent. Then the lateral&#10;branches were innumerable--inconceivable--and so returning in upon&#10;themselves, that our most exact ideas in regard to the whole mansion&#10;were not very far different from those with which we pondered upon&#10;infinity. During the five years of my residence here, I was never able&#10;to ascertain with precision, in what remote locality lay the little&#10;sleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen or twenty other&#10;scholars.&#10;&#10;The school-room was the largest in the house--I could not help thinking,&#10;in the world. It was very long, narrow, and dismally low, with pointed&#10;Gothic windows and a ceiling of oak. In a remote and terror-inspiring&#10;angle was a square enclosure of eight or ten feet, comprising the&#10;sanctum, &quot;during hours,&quot; of our principal, the Reverend Dr. Bransby. It&#10;was a solid structure, with massy door, sooner than open which in the&#10;absence of the &quot;Dominic,&quot; we would all have willingly perished by the&#10;peine forte et dure. In other angles were two other similar boxes, far&#10;less reverenced, indeed, but still greatly matters of awe. One of&#10;these was the pulpit of the &quot;classical&quot; usher, one of the &quot;English and&#10;mathematical.&quot; Interspersed about the room, crossing and recrossing&#10;in endless irregularity, were innumerable benches and desks, black,&#10;ancient, and time-worn, piled desperately with much-bethumbed books,&#10;and so beseamed with initial letters, names at full length, grotesque&#10;figures, and other multiplied efforts of the knife, as to have entirely&#10;lost what little of original form might have been their portion in days&#10;long departed. A huge bucket with water stood at one extremity of the&#10;room, and a clock of stupendous dimensions at the other.&#10;&#10;Encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy, I passed, yet&#10;not in tedium or disgust, the years of the third lustrum of my life.&#10;The teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of incident to&#10;occupy or amuse it; and the apparently dismal monotony of a school was&#10;replete with more intense excitement than my riper youth has derived&#10;from luxury, or my full manhood from crime. Yet I must believe that my&#10;first mental development had in it much of the uncommon--even much of&#10;the outre. Upon mankind at large the events of very early existence&#10;rarely leave in mature age any definite impression. All is gray&#10;shadow--a weak and irregular remembrance--an indistinct regathering of&#10;feeble pleasures and phantasmagoric pains. With me this is not so. In&#10;childhood I must have felt with the energy of a man what I now find&#10;stamped upon memory in lines as vivid, as deep, and as durable as the&#10;exergues of the Carthaginian medals.&#10;&#10;Yet in fact--in the fact of the world's view--how little was there&#10;to remember! The morning's awakening, the nightly summons to bed;&#10;the connings, the recitations; the periodical half-holidays, and&#10;perambulations; the play-ground, with its broils, its pastimes, its&#10;intrigues;--these, by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were made to&#10;involve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich incident, an&#10;universe of varied emotion, of excitement the most passionate and&#10;spirit-stirring. &quot;Oh, le bon temps, que ce siecle de fer!&quot;&#10;&#10;In truth, the ardor, the enthusiasm, and the imperiousness of my&#10;disposition, soon rendered me a marked character among my schoolmates,&#10;and by slow, but natural gradations, gave me an ascendancy over all&#10;not greatly older than myself;--over all with a single exception.&#10;This exception was found in the person of a scholar, who, although&#10;no relation, bore the same Christian and surname as myself;--a&#10;circumstance, in fact, little remarkable; for, notwithstanding a noble&#10;descent, mine was one of those everyday appellations which seem, by&#10;prescriptive right, to have been, time out of mind, the common property&#10;of the mob. In this narrative I have therefore designated myself as&#10;William Wilson,--a fictitious title not very dissimilar to the real.&#10;My namesake alone, of those who in school phraseology constituted &quot;our&#10;set,&quot; presumed to compete with me in the studies of the class--in the&#10;sports and broils of the play-ground--to refuse implicit belief in my&#10;assertions, and submission to my will--indeed, to interfere with my&#10;arbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever. If there is on earth a&#10;supreme and unqualified despotism, it is the despotism of a master mind&#10;in boyhood over the less energetic spirits of its companions.&#10;&#10;Wilson's rebellion was to me a source of the greatest&#10;embarrassment;--the more so as, in spite of the bravado with which in&#10;public I made a point of treating him and his pretensions, I secretly&#10;felt that I feared him, and could not help thinking the equality which&#10;he maintained so easily with myself, a proof of his true superiority;&#10;since not to be overcome cost me a perpetual struggle. Yet this&#10;superiority--even this equality--was in truth acknowledged by no one but&#10;myself; our associates, by some unaccountable blindness, seemed not even&#10;to suspect it. Indeed, his competition, his resistance, and especially&#10;his impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes, were not more&#10;pointed than private. He appeared to be destitute alike of the ambition&#10;which urged, and of the passionate energy of mind which enabled me to&#10;excel. In his rivalry he might have been supposed actuated solely by a&#10;whimsical desire to thwart, astonish, or mortify myself; although there&#10;were times when I could not help observing, with a feeling made up of&#10;wonder, abasement, and pique, that he mingled with his injuries, his&#10;insults, or his contradictions, a certain most inappropriate, and&#10;assuredly most unwelcome affectionateness of manner. I could only&#10;conceive this singular behavior to arise from a consummate self-conceit&#10;assuming the vulgar airs of patronage and protection.&#10;&#10;Perhaps it was this latter trait in Wilson's conduct, conjoined with our&#10;identity of name, and the mere accident of our having entered the school&#10;upon the same day, which set afloat the notion that we were brothers,&#10;among the senior classes in the academy. These do not usually inquire&#10;with much strictness into the affairs of their juniors. I have before&#10;said, or should have said, that Wilson was not, in the most remote&#10;degree, connected with my family. But assuredly if we had been brothers&#10;we must have been twins; for, after leaving Dr. Bransby's, I casually&#10;learned that my namesake was born on the nineteenth of January,&#10;1813--and this is a somewhat remarkable coincidence; for the day is&#10;precisely that of my own nativity.&#10;&#10;It may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety occasioned me&#10;by the rivalry of Wilson, and his intolerable spirit of contradiction,&#10;I could not bring myself to hate him altogether. We had, to be sure,&#10;nearly every day a quarrel in which, yielding me publicly the palm of&#10;victory, he, in some manner, contrived to make me feel that it was he&#10;who had deserved it; yet a sense of pride on my part, and a veritable&#10;dignity on his own, kept us always upon what are called &quot;speaking&#10;terms,&quot; while there were many points of strong congeniality in our&#10;tempers, operating to awake me in a sentiment which our position alone,&#10;perhaps, prevented from ripening into friendship. It is difficult,&#10;indeed, to define, or even to describe, my real feelings towards&#10;him. They formed a motley and heterogeneous admixture;--some petulant&#10;animosity, which was not yet hatred, some esteem, more respect, much&#10;fear, with a world of uneasy curiosity. To the moralist it will be&#10;unnecessary to say, in addition, that Wilson and myself were the most&#10;inseparable of companions.&#10;&#10;It was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between us,&#10;which turned all my attacks upon him, (and they were many, either open&#10;or covert) into the channel of banter or practical joke (giving pain&#10;while assuming the aspect of mere fun) rather than into a more serious&#10;and determined hostility. But my endeavours on this head were by no&#10;means uniformly successful, even when my plans were the most wittily&#10;concocted; for my namesake had much about him, in character, of that&#10;unassuming and quiet austerity which, while enjoying the poignancy of&#10;its own jokes, has no heel of Achilles in itself, and absolutely refuses&#10;to be laughed at. I could find, indeed, but one vulnerable point,&#10;and that, lying in a personal peculiarity, arising, perhaps, from&#10;constitutional disease, would have been spared by any antagonist less&#10;at his wit's end than myself;--my rival had a weakness in the faucal or&#10;guttural organs, which precluded him from raising his voice at any time&#10;above a very low whisper. Of this defect I did not fail to take what&#10;poor advantage lay in my power.&#10;&#10;Wilson's retaliations in kind were many; and there was one form of his&#10;practical wit that disturbed me beyond measure. How his sagacity first&#10;discovered at all that so petty a thing would vex me, is a question I&#10;never could solve; but, having discovered, he habitually practised the&#10;annoyance. I had always felt aversion to my uncourtly patronymic, and&#10;its very common, if not plebeian praenomen. The words were venom in my&#10;ears; and when, upon the day of my arrival, a second William Wilson came&#10;also to the academy, I felt angry with him for bearing the name, and&#10;doubly disgusted with the name because a stranger bore it, who would&#10;be the cause of its twofold repetition, who would be constantly in my&#10;presence, and whose concerns, in the ordinary routine of the school&#10;business, must inevitably, on account of the detestable coincidence, be&#10;often confounded with my own.&#10;&#10;The feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with every&#10;circumstance tending to show resemblance, moral or physical, between my&#10;rival and myself. I had not then discovered the remarkable fact that we&#10;were of the same age; but I saw that we were of the same height, and&#10;I perceived that we were even singularly alike in general contour of&#10;person and outline of feature. I was galled, too, by the rumor touching&#10;a relationship, which had grown current in the upper forms. In a word,&#10;nothing could more seriously disturb me, (although I scrupulously&#10;concealed such disturbance,) than any allusion to a similarity of mind,&#10;person, or condition existing between us. But, in truth, I had no reason&#10;to believe that (with the exception of the matter of relationship, and&#10;in the case of Wilson himself,) this similarity had ever been made a&#10;subject of comment, or even observed at all by our schoolfellows. That&#10;he observed it in all its bearings, and as fixedly as I, was apparent;&#10;but that he could discover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of&#10;annoyance, can only be attributed, as I said before, to his more than&#10;ordinary penetration.&#10;&#10;His cue, which was to perfect an imitation of myself, lay both in words&#10;and in actions; and most admirably did he play his part. My dress it&#10;was an easy matter to copy; my gait and general manner were, without&#10;difficulty, appropriated; in spite of his constitutional defect, even my&#10;voice did not escape him. My louder tones were, of course, unattempted,&#10;but then the key, it was identical; and his singular whisper, it grew&#10;the very echo of my own.&#10;&#10;How greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me, (for it could&#10;not justly be termed a caricature,) I will not now venture to describe.&#10;I had but one consolation--in the fact that the imitation, apparently,&#10;was noticed by myself alone, and that I had to endure only the knowing&#10;and strangely sarcastic smiles of my namesake himself. Satisfied with&#10;having produced in my bosom the intended effect, he seemed to chuckle&#10;in secret over the sting he had inflicted, and was characteristically&#10;disregardful of the public applause which the success of his witty&#10;endeavours might have so easily elicited. That the school, indeed, did&#10;not feel his design, perceive its accomplishment, and participate in&#10;his sneer, was, for many anxious months, a riddle I could not&#10;resolve. Perhaps the gradation of his copy rendered it not so readily&#10;perceptible; or, more possibly, I owed my security to the master air of&#10;the copyist, who, disdaining the letter, (which in a painting is all&#10;the obtuse can see,) gave but the full spirit of his original for my&#10;individual contemplation and chagrin.&#10;&#10;I have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of patronage&#10;which he assumed toward me, and of his frequent officious interference&#10;with my will. This interference often took the ungracious character of&#10;advice; advice not openly given, but hinted or insinuated. I received it&#10;with a repugnance which gained strength as I grew in years. Yet, at this&#10;distant day, let me do him the simple justice to acknowledge that I can&#10;recall no occasion when the suggestions of my rival were on the side&#10;of those errors or follies so usual to his immature age and seeming&#10;inexperience; that his moral sense, at least, if not his general talents&#10;and worldly wisdom, was far keener than my own; and that I might,&#10;to-day, have been a better, and thus a happier man, had I less&#10;frequently rejected the counsels embodied in those meaning whispers&#10;which I then but too cordially hated and too bitterly despised.&#10;&#10;As it was, I at length grew restive in the extreme under his distasteful&#10;supervision, and daily resented more and more openly what I considered&#10;his intolerable arrogance. I have said that, in the first years of our&#10;connexion as schoolmates, my feelings in regard to him might have&#10;been easily ripened into friendship: but, in the latter months of my&#10;residence at the academy, although the intrusion of his ordinary manner&#10;had, beyond doubt, in some measure, abated, my sentiments, in nearly&#10;similar proportion, partook very much of positive hatred. Upon one&#10;occasion he saw this, I think, and afterwards avoided, or made a show of&#10;avoiding me.&#10;&#10;It was about the same period, if I remember aright, that, in an&#10;altercation of violence with him, in which he was more than usually&#10;thrown off his guard, and spoke and acted with an openness of demeanor&#10;rather foreign to his nature, I discovered, or fancied I discovered,&#10;in his accent, his air, and general appearance, a something which first&#10;startled, and then deeply interested me, by bringing to mind dim visions&#10;of my earliest infancy--wild, confused and thronging memories of a&#10;time when memory herself was yet unborn. I cannot better describe the&#10;sensation which oppressed me than by saying that I could with difficulty&#10;shake off the belief of my having been acquainted with the being who&#10;stood before me, at some epoch very long ago--some point of the past&#10;even infinitely remote. The delusion, however, faded rapidly as it came;&#10;and I mention it at all but to define the day of the last conversation I&#10;there held with my singular namesake.&#10;&#10;The huge old house, with its countless subdivisions, had several large&#10;chambers communicating with each other, where slept the greater number&#10;of the students. There were, however, (as must necessarily happen in a&#10;building so awkwardly planned,) many little nooks or recesses, the&#10;odds and ends of the structure; and these the economic ingenuity of Dr.&#10;Bransby had also fitted up as dormitories; although, being the merest&#10;closets, they were capable of accommodating but a single individual. One&#10;of these small apartments was occupied by Wilson.&#10;&#10;One night, about the close of my fifth year at the school, and&#10;immediately after the altercation just mentioned, finding every one&#10;wrapped in sleep, I arose from bed, and, lamp in hand, stole through a&#10;wilderness of narrow passages from my own bedroom to that of my rival. I&#10;had long been plotting one of those ill-natured pieces of practical wit&#10;at his expense in which I had hitherto been so uniformly unsuccessful.&#10;It was my intention, now, to put my scheme in operation, and I resolved&#10;to make him feel the whole extent of the malice with which I was imbued.&#10;Having reached his closet, I noiselessly entered, leaving the lamp, with&#10;a shade over it, on the outside. I advanced a step, and listened to&#10;the sound of his tranquil breathing. Assured of his being asleep, I&#10;returned, took the light, and with it again approached the bed. Close&#10;curtains were around it, which, in the prosecution of my plan, I&#10;slowly and quietly withdrew, when the bright rays fell vividly upon&#10;the sleeper, and my eyes, at the same moment, upon his countenance. I&#10;looked;--and a numbness, an iciness of feeling instantly pervaded my&#10;frame. My breast heaved, my knees tottered, my whole spirit became&#10;possessed with an objectless yet intolerable horror. Gasping for&#10;breath, I lowered the lamp in still nearer proximity to the face. Were&#10;these--these the lineaments of William Wilson? I saw, indeed, that they&#10;were his, but I shook as if with a fit of the ague in fancying they&#10;were not. What was there about them to confound me in this manner? I&#10;gazed;--while my brain reeled with a multitude of incoherent thoughts.&#10;Not thus he appeared--assuredly not thus--in the vivacity of his waking&#10;hours. The same name! the same contour of person! the same day of&#10;arrival at the academy! And then his dogged and meaningless imitation&#10;of my gait, my voice, my habits, and my manner! Was it, in truth, within&#10;the bounds of human possibility, that what I now saw was the result,&#10;merely, of the habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation?&#10;Awe-stricken, and with a creeping shudder, I extinguished the lamp,&#10;passed silently from the chamber, and left, at once, the halls of that&#10;old academy, never to enter them again.&#10;&#10;After a lapse of some months, spent at home in mere idleness, I found&#10;myself a student at Eton. The brief interval had been sufficient to&#10;enfeeble my remembrance of the events at Dr. Bransby's, or at least&#10;to effect a material change in the nature of the feelings with which&#10;I remembered them. The truth--the tragedy--of the drama was no more.&#10;I could now find room to doubt the evidence of my senses; and seldom&#10;called up the subject at all but with wonder at extent of human&#10;credulity, and a smile at the vivid force of the imagination which I&#10;hereditarily possessed. Neither was this species of scepticism likely to&#10;be diminished by the character of the life I led at Eton. The vortex of&#10;thoughtless folly into which I there so immediately and so recklessly&#10;plunged, washed away all but the froth of my past hours, engulfed at&#10;once every solid or serious impression, and left to memory only the&#10;veriest levities of a former existence.&#10;&#10;I do not wish, however, to trace the course of my miserable profligacy&#10;here--a profligacy which set at defiance the laws, while it eluded&#10;the vigilance of the institution. Three years of folly, passed without&#10;profit, had but given me rooted habits of vice, and added, in a somewhat&#10;unusual degree, to my bodily stature, when, after a week of soulless&#10;dissipation, I invited a small party of the most dissolute students to a&#10;secret carousal in my chambers. We met at a late hour of the night; for&#10;our debaucheries were to be faithfully protracted until morning. The&#10;wine flowed freely, and there were not wanting other and perhaps more&#10;dangerous seductions; so that the gray dawn had already faintly appeared&#10;in the east, while our delirious extravagance was at its height. Madly&#10;flushed with cards and intoxication, I was in the act of insisting upon&#10;a toast of more than wonted profanity, when my attention was suddenly&#10;diverted by the violent, although partial unclosing of the door of the&#10;apartment, and by the eager voice of a servant from without. He said&#10;that some person, apparently in great haste, demanded to speak with me&#10;in the hall.&#10;&#10;Wildly excited with wine, the unexpected interruption rather delighted&#10;than surprised me. I staggered forward at once, and a few steps brought&#10;me to the vestibule of the building. In this low and small room there&#10;hung no lamp; and now no light at all was admitted, save that of the&#10;exceedingly feeble dawn which made its way through the semi-circular&#10;window. As I put my foot over the threshold, I became aware of the&#10;figure of a youth about my own height, and habited in a white kerseymere&#10;morning frock, cut in the novel fashion of the one I myself wore at the&#10;moment. This the faint light enabled me to perceive; but the features of&#10;his face I could not distinguish. Upon my entering he strode hurriedly&#10;up to me, and, seizing me by the arm with a gesture of petulant&#10;impatience, whispered the words &quot;William Wilson!&quot; in my ear.&#10;&#10;I grew perfectly sober in an instant. There was that in the manner of&#10;the stranger, and in the tremulous shake of his uplifted finger, as he&#10;held it between my eyes and the light, which filled me with unqualified&#10;amazement; but it was not this which had so violently moved me. It&#10;was the pregnancy of solemn admonition in the singular, low, hissing&#10;utterance; and, above all, it was the character, the tone, the key, of&#10;those few, simple, and familiar, yet whispered syllables, which came&#10;with a thousand thronging memories of bygone days, and struck upon my&#10;soul with the shock of a galvanic battery. Ere I could recover the use&#10;of my senses he was gone.&#10;&#10;Although this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my disordered&#10;imagination, yet was it evanescent as vivid. For some weeks, indeed, I&#10;busied myself in earnest inquiry, or was wrapped in a cloud of morbid&#10;speculation. I did not pretend to disguise from my perception the&#10;identity of the singular individual who thus perseveringly interfered&#10;with my affairs, and harassed me with his insinuated counsel. But&#10;who and what was this Wilson?--and whence came he?--and what were his&#10;purposes? Upon neither of these points could I be satisfied; merely&#10;ascertaining, in regard to him, that a sudden accident in his family had&#10;caused his removal from Dr. Bransby's academy on the afternoon of the&#10;day in which I myself had eloped. But in a brief period I ceased&#10;to think upon the subject; my attention being all absorbed in&#10;a contemplated departure for Oxford. Thither I soon went; the&#10;uncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me with an outfit and&#10;annual establishment, which would enable me to indulge at will in&#10;the luxury already so dear to my heart,--to vie in profuseness of&#10;expenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the wealthiest earldoms in&#10;Great Britain.&#10;&#10;Excited by such appliances to vice, my constitutional temperament broke&#10;forth with redoubled ardor, and I spurned even the common restraints of&#10;decency in the mad infatuation of my revels. But it were absurd to&#10;pause in the detail of my extravagance. Let it suffice, that among&#10;spendthrifts I out-Heroded Herod, and that, giving name to a multitude&#10;of novel follies, I added no brief appendix to the long catalogue of&#10;vices then usual in the most dissolute university of Europe.&#10;&#10;It could hardly be credited, however, that I had, even here, so utterly&#10;fallen from the gentlemanly estate, as to seek acquaintance with the&#10;vilest arts of the gambler by profession, and, having become an adept&#10;in his despicable science, to practise it habitually as a means of&#10;increasing my already enormous income at the expense of the weak-minded&#10;among my fellow-collegians. Such, nevertheless, was the fact. And the&#10;very enormity of this offence against all manly and honourable sentiment&#10;proved, beyond doubt, the main if not the sole reason of the impunity&#10;with which it was committed. Who, indeed, among my most abandoned&#10;associates, would not rather have disputed the clearest evidence of his&#10;senses, than have suspected of such courses, the gay, the frank, the&#10;generous William Wilson--the noblest and most liberal commoner at Oxford--him&#10;whose follies (said his parasites) were but the follies of youth and&#10;unbridled fancy--whose errors but inimitable whim--whose darkest vice&#10;but a careless and dashing extravagance?&#10;&#10;I had been now two years successfully busied in this way, when there&#10;came to the university a young parvenu nobleman, Glendinning--rich, said&#10;report, as Herodes Atticus--his riches, too, as easily acquired. I soon&#10;found him of weak intellect, and, of course, marked him as a fitting&#10;subject for my skill. I frequently engaged him in play, and contrived,&#10;with the gambler's usual art, to let him win considerable sums, the more&#10;effectually to entangle him in my snares. At length, my schemes being&#10;ripe, I met him (with the full intention that this meeting should be&#10;final and decisive) at the chambers of a fellow-commoner, (Mr. Preston,)&#10;equally intimate with both, but who, to do him Justice, entertained&#10;not even a remote suspicion of my design. To give to this a better&#10;colouring, I had contrived to have assembled a party of some eight or&#10;ten, and was solicitously careful that the introduction of cards should&#10;appear accidental, and originate in the proposal of my contemplated&#10;dupe himself. To be brief upon a vile topic, none of the low finesse was&#10;omitted, so customary upon similar occasions that it is a just matter&#10;for wonder how any are still found so besotted as to fall its victim.&#10;&#10;We had protracted our sitting far into the night, and I had at length&#10;effected the manoeuvre of getting Glendinning as my sole antagonist. The&#10;game, too, was my favorite ecarte! The rest of the company, interested&#10;in the extent of our play, had abandoned their own cards, and were&#10;standing around us as spectators. The parvenu, who had been induced&#10;by my artifices in the early part of the evening, to drink deeply, now&#10;shuffled, dealt, or played, with a wild nervousness of manner for which&#10;his intoxication, I thought, might partially, but could not altogether&#10;account. In a very short period he had become my debtor to a large&#10;amount, when, having taken a long draught of port, he did precisely&#10;what I had been coolly anticipating--he proposed to double our already&#10;extravagant stakes. With a well-feigned show of reluctance, and not&#10;until after my repeated refusal had seduced him into some angry words&#10;which gave a color of pique to my compliance, did I finally comply. The&#10;result, of course, did but prove how entirely the prey was in my toils;&#10;in less than an hour he had quadrupled his debt. For some time his&#10;countenance had been losing the florid tinge lent it by the wine; but&#10;now, to my astonishment, I perceived that it had grown to a pallor truly&#10;fearful. I say to my astonishment. Glendinning had been represented to&#10;my eager inquiries as immeasurably wealthy; and the sums which he had&#10;as yet lost, although in themselves vast, could not, I supposed, very&#10;seriously annoy, much less so violently affect him. That he was overcome&#10;by the wine just swallowed, was the idea which most readily presented&#10;itself; and, rather with a view to the preservation of my own character&#10;in the eyes of my associates, than from any less interested motive, I&#10;was about to insist, peremptorily, upon a discontinuance of the play,&#10;when some expressions at my elbow from among the company, and an&#10;ejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of Glendinning, gave me&#10;to understand that I had effected his total ruin under circumstances&#10;which, rendering him an object for the pity of all, should have&#10;protected him from the ill offices even of a fiend.&#10;&#10;What now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say. The pitiable&#10;condition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed gloom over all;&#10;and, for some moments, a profound silence was maintained, during which I&#10;could not help feeling my cheeks tingle with the many burning glances&#10;of scorn or reproach cast upon me by the less abandoned of the party.&#10;I will even own that an intolerable weight of anxiety was for a&#10;brief instant lifted from my bosom by the sudden and extraordinary&#10;interruption which ensued. The wide, heavy folding doors of the&#10;apartment were all at once thrown open, to their full extent, with a&#10;vigorous and rushing impetuosity that extinguished, as if by magic,&#10;every candle in the room. Their light, in dying, enabled us just to&#10;perceive that a stranger had entered, about my own height, and closely&#10;muffled in a cloak. The darkness, however, was now total; and we could&#10;only feel that he was standing in our midst. Before any one of us could&#10;recover from the extreme astonishment into which this rudeness had&#10;thrown all, we heard the voice of the intruder.&#10;&#10;&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; he said, in a low, distinct, and never-to-be-forgotten&#10;whisper which thrilled to the very marrow of my bones, &quot;Gentlemen, I&#10;make no apology for this behaviour, because in thus behaving, I am&#10;but fulfilling a duty. You are, beyond doubt, uninformed of the true&#10;character of the person who has to-night won at ecarte a large sum&#10;of money from Lord Glendinning. I will therefore put you upon an&#10;expeditious and decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary&#10;information. Please to examine, at your leisure, the inner linings of&#10;the cuff of his left sleeve, and the several little packages which may&#10;be found in the somewhat capacious pockets of his embroidered morning&#10;wrapper.&quot;&#10;&#10;While he spoke, so profound was the stillness that one might have heard&#10;a pin drop upon the floor. In ceasing, he departed at once, and as&#10;abruptly as he had entered. Can I--shall I describe my sensations?--must&#10;I say that I felt all the horrors of the damned? Most assuredly I had&#10;little time given for reflection. Many hands roughly seized me upon the&#10;spot, and lights were immediately reprocured. A search ensued. In the&#10;lining of my sleeve were found all the court cards essential in ecarte,&#10;and, in the pockets of my wrapper, a number of packs, facsimiles of&#10;those used at our sittings, with the single exception that mine were of&#10;the species called, technically, arrondees; the honours being slightly&#10;convex at the ends, the lower cards slightly convex at the sides. In&#10;this disposition, the dupe who cuts, as customary, at the length of the&#10;pack, will invariably find that he cuts his antagonist an honor; while&#10;the gambler, cutting at the breadth, will, as certainly, cut nothing for&#10;his victim which may count in the records of the game.&#10;&#10;Any burst of indignation upon this discovery would have affected me less&#10;than the silent contempt, or the sarcastic composure, with which it was&#10;received.&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. Wilson,&quot; said our host, stooping to remove from beneath his feet&#10;an exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs, &quot;Mr. Wilson, this is your&#10;property.&quot; (The weather was cold; and, upon quitting my own room, I had&#10;thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper, putting it off upon reaching&#10;the scene of play.) &quot;I presume it is supererogatory to seek here (eyeing&#10;the folds of the garment with a bitter smile) for any farther evidence&#10;of your skill. Indeed, we have had enough. You will see the necessity,&#10;I hope, of quitting Oxford--at all events, of quitting instantly my&#10;chambers.&quot;&#10;&#10;Abased, humbled to the dust as I then was, it is probable that I should&#10;have resented this galling language by immediate personal violence, had&#10;not my whole attention been at the moment arrested by a fact of the&#10;most startling character. The cloak which I had worn was of a rare&#10;description of fur; how rare, how extravagantly costly, I shall not&#10;venture to say. Its fashion, too, was of my own fantastic invention; for&#10;I was fastidious to an absurd degree of coxcombry, in matters of this&#10;frivolous nature. When, therefore, Mr. Preston reached me that which&#10;he had picked up upon the floor, and near the folding doors of the&#10;apartment, it was with an astonishment nearly bordering upon terror,&#10;that I perceived my own already hanging on my arm, (where I had no doubt&#10;unwittingly placed it,) and that the one presented me was but its exact&#10;counterpart in every, in even the minutest possible particular. The&#10;singular being who had so disastrously exposed me, had been muffled,&#10;I remembered, in a cloak; and none had been worn at all by any of&#10;the members of our party with the exception of myself. Retaining some&#10;presence of mind, I took the one offered me by Preston; placed it,&#10;unnoticed, over my own; left the apartment with a resolute scowl of&#10;defiance; and, next morning ere dawn of day, commenced a hurried journey&#10;from Oxford to the continent, in a perfect agony of horror and of shame.&#10;&#10;I fled in vain. My evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation, and&#10;proved, indeed, that the exercise of its mysterious dominion had as yet&#10;only begun. Scarcely had I set foot in Paris ere I had fresh evidence of&#10;the detestable interest taken by this Wilson in my concerns. Years flew,&#10;while I experienced no relief. Villain!--at Rome, with how untimely,&#10;yet with how spectral an officiousness, stepped he in between me and my&#10;ambition! At Vienna, too--at Berlin--and at Moscow! Where, in truth, had&#10;I not bitter cause to curse him within my heart? From his inscrutable&#10;tyranny did I at length flee, panic-stricken, as from a pestilence; and&#10;to the very ends of the earth I fled in vain.&#10;&#10;And again, and again, in secret communion with my own spirit, would&#10;I demand the questions &quot;Who is he?--whence came he?--and what are his&#10;objects?&quot; But no answer was there found. And then I scrutinized, with a&#10;minute scrutiny, the forms, and the methods, and the leading traits of&#10;his impertinent supervision. But even here there was very little upon&#10;which to base a conjecture. It was noticeable, indeed, that, in no one&#10;of the multiplied instances in which he had of late crossed my path, had&#10;he so crossed it except to frustrate those schemes, or to disturb those&#10;actions, which, if fully carried out, might have resulted in bitter&#10;mischief. Poor justification this, in truth, for an authority so&#10;imperiously assumed! Poor indemnity for natural rights of self-agency so&#10;pertinaciously, so insultingly denied!&#10;&#10;I had also been forced to notice that my tormentor, for a very long&#10;period of time, (while scrupulously and with miraculous dexterity&#10;maintaining his whim of an identity of apparel with myself,) had so&#10;contrived it, in the execution of his varied interference with my will,&#10;that I saw not, at any moment, the features of his face. Be Wilson what&#10;he might, this, at least, was but the veriest of affectation, or of&#10;folly. Could he, for an instant, have supposed that, in my admonisher&#10;at Eton--in the destroyer of my honor at Oxford,--in him who thwarted my&#10;ambition at Rome, my revenge at Paris, my passionate love at Naples, or&#10;what he falsely termed my avarice in Egypt,--that in this, my arch-enemy&#10;and evil genius, could fail to recognise the William Wilson of my&#10;school boy days,--the namesake, the companion, the rival,--the hated and&#10;dreaded rival at Dr. Bransby's? Impossible!--But let me hasten to the&#10;last eventful scene of the drama.&#10;&#10;Thus far I had succumbed supinely to this imperious domination. The&#10;sentiment of deep awe with which I habitually regarded the elevated&#10;character, the majestic wisdom, the apparent omnipresence and&#10;omnipotence of Wilson, added to a feeling of even terror, with which&#10;certain other traits in his nature and assumptions inspired me, had&#10;operated, hitherto, to impress me with an idea of my own utter weakness&#10;and helplessness, and to suggest an implicit, although bitterly&#10;reluctant submission to his arbitrary will. But, of late days, I had&#10;given myself up entirely to wine; and its maddening influence upon my&#10;hereditary temper rendered me more and more impatient of control. I&#10;began to murmur,--to hesitate,--to resist. And was it only fancy which&#10;induced me to believe that, with the increase of my own firmness, that&#10;of my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution? Be this as it may,&#10;I now began to feel the inspiration of a burning hope, and at length&#10;nurtured in my secret thoughts a stern and desperate resolution that I&#10;would submit no longer to be enslaved.&#10;&#10;It was at Rome, during the Carnival of 18--, that I attended a&#10;masquerade in the palazzo of the Neapolitan Duke Di Broglio. I had&#10;indulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the wine-table; and&#10;now the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded rooms irritated me beyond&#10;endurance. The difficulty, too, of forcing my way through the mazes of&#10;the company contributed not a little to the ruffling of my temper; for&#10;I was anxiously seeking, (let me not say with what unworthy motive) the&#10;young, the gay, the beautiful wife of the aged and doting Di Broglio.&#10;With a too unscrupulous confidence she had previously communicated to me&#10;the secret of the costume in which she would be habited, and now, having&#10;caught a glimpse of her person, I was hurrying to make my way into her&#10;presence.--At this moment I felt a light hand placed upon my shoulder,&#10;and that ever-remembered, low, damnable whisper within my ear.&#10;&#10;In an absolute phrenzy of wrath, I turned at once upon him who had thus&#10;interrupted me, and seized him violently by the collar. He was attired,&#10;as I had expected, in a costume altogether similar to my own; wearing a&#10;Spanish cloak of blue velvet, begirt about the waist with a crimson belt&#10;sustaining a rapier. A mask of black silk entirely covered his face.&#10;&#10;&quot;Scoundrel!&quot; I said, in a voice husky with rage, while every syllable&#10;I uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury, &quot;scoundrel! impostor! accursed&#10;villain! you shall not--you shall not dog me unto death! Follow me, or I&#10;stab you where you stand!&quot;--and I broke my way from the ball-room into&#10;a small ante-chamber adjoining--dragging him unresistingly with me as I&#10;went.&#10;&#10;Upon entering, I thrust him furiously from me. He staggered against the&#10;wall, while I closed the door with an oath, and commanded him to draw.&#10;He hesitated but for an instant; then, with a slight sigh, drew in&#10;silence, and put himself upon his defence.&#10;&#10;The contest was brief indeed. I was frantic with every species of wild&#10;excitement, and felt within my single arm the energy and power of a&#10;multitude. In a few seconds I forced him by sheer strength against the&#10;wainscoting, and thus, getting him at mercy, plunged my sword, with&#10;brute ferocity, repeatedly through and through his bosom.&#10;&#10;At that instant some person tried the latch of the door. I hastened&#10;to prevent an intrusion, and then immediately returned to my dying&#10;antagonist. But what human language can adequately portray that&#10;astonishment, that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then&#10;presented to view? The brief moment in which I averted my eyes had been&#10;sufficient to produce, apparently, a material change in the arrangements&#10;at the upper or farther end of the room. A large mirror,--so at first it&#10;seemed to me in my confusion--now stood where none had been perceptible&#10;before; and, as I stepped up to it in extremity of terror, mine own&#10;image, but with features all pale and dabbled in blood, advanced to meet&#10;me with a feeble and tottering gait.&#10;&#10;Thus it appeared, I say, but was not. It was my antagonist--it was&#10;Wilson, who then stood before me in the agonies of his dissolution.&#10;His mask and cloak lay, where he had thrown them, upon the floor. Not&#10;a thread in all his raiment--not a line in all the marked and singular&#10;lineaments of his face which was not, even in the most absolute&#10;identity, mine own!&#10;&#10;It was Wilson; but he spoke no longer in a whisper, and I could have&#10;fancied that I myself was speaking while he said:&#10;&#10;&quot;You have conquered, and I yield. Yet, henceforward art thou also&#10;dead--dead to the World, to Heaven and to Hope! In me didst thou&#10;exist--and, in my death, see by this image, which is thine own, how&#10;utterly thou hast murdered thyself.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;THE TELL-TALE HEART.&#10;&#10;TRUE!--nervous--very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but&#10;why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses--not&#10;destroyed--not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I&#10;heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things&#10;in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily--how&#10;calmly I can tell you the whole story.&#10;&#10;It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once&#10;conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion&#10;there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had&#10;never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his&#10;eye! yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture--a pale blue eye,&#10;with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and&#10;so by degrees--very gradually--I made up my mind to take the life of the&#10;old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.&#10;&#10;Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you&#10;should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded--with&#10;what caution--with what foresight--with what dissimulation I went to&#10;work! I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week&#10;before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch&#10;of his door and opened it--oh so gently! And then, when I had made an&#10;opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed,&#10;closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh,&#10;you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it&#10;slowly--very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man's&#10;sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so&#10;far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have&#10;been so wise as this? And then, when my head was well in the room, I&#10;undid the lantern cautiously--oh, so cautiously--cautiously (for the&#10;hinges creaked)--I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell&#10;upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights--every night&#10;just at midnight--but I found the eye always closed; and so it was&#10;impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but&#10;his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into&#10;the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a&#10;hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you see he&#10;would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every&#10;night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.&#10;&#10;Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the&#10;door. A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never&#10;before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers--of my&#10;sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think&#10;that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to&#10;dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and&#10;perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled.&#10;Now you may think that I drew back--but no. His room was as black as&#10;pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened,&#10;through fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see the&#10;opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.&#10;&#10;I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb&#10;slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, crying&#10;out--&quot;Who's there?&quot;&#10;&#10;I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a&#10;muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still&#10;sitting up in the bed listening;--just as I have done, night after&#10;night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.&#10;&#10;Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal&#10;terror. It was not a groan of pain or of grief--oh, no!--it was the low&#10;stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged&#10;with awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when&#10;all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with&#10;its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well.&#10;I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at&#10;heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight&#10;noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since&#10;growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could&#10;not. He had been saying to himself--&quot;It is nothing but the wind in the&#10;chimney--it is only a mouse crossing the floor,&quot; or &quot;It is merely a&#10;cricket which has made a single chirp.&quot; Yes, he had been trying to&#10;comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain.&#10;All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his&#10;black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the&#10;mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to&#10;feel--although he neither saw nor heard--to feel the presence of my head&#10;within the room.&#10;&#10;When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie&#10;down, I resolved to open a little--a very, very little crevice in&#10;the lantern. So I opened it--you cannot imagine how stealthily,&#10;stealthily--until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of the&#10;spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye.&#10;&#10;It was open--wide, wide open--and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I&#10;saw it with perfect distinctness--all a dull blue, with a hideous&#10;veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see&#10;nothing else of the old man's face or person: for I had directed the ray&#10;as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.&#10;&#10;And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but&#10;over-acuteness of the sense?--now, I say, there came to my ears a low,&#10;dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I&#10;knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man's heart. It&#10;increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into&#10;courage.&#10;&#10;But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the&#10;lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon&#10;the eve. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew&#10;quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old man's&#10;terror must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every&#10;moment!--do you mark me well I have told you that I am nervous: so I am.&#10;And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of&#10;that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable&#10;terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still. But&#10;the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. And now&#10;a new anxiety seized me--the sound would be heard by a neighbour! The&#10;old man's hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern&#10;and leaped into the room. He shrieked once--once only. In an instant&#10;I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then&#10;smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the&#10;heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it&#10;would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man&#10;was dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone,&#10;stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many&#10;minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would&#10;trouble me no more.&#10;&#10;If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe&#10;the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night&#10;waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered&#10;the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs.&#10;&#10;I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and&#10;deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so&#10;cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye--not even his--could have&#10;detected any thing wrong. There was nothing to wash out--no stain of any&#10;kind--no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had&#10;caught all--ha! ha!&#10;&#10;When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock--still dark&#10;as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the&#10;street door. I went down to open it with a light heart,--for what had&#10;I now to fear? There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with&#10;perfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by&#10;a neighbour during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused;&#10;information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the&#10;officers) had been deputed to search the premises.&#10;&#10;I smiled,--for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The&#10;shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was&#10;absent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade&#10;them search--search well. I led them, at length, to his chamber. I&#10;showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of&#10;my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here&#10;to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of&#10;my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which&#10;reposed the corpse of the victim.&#10;&#10;The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was&#10;singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they&#10;chatted of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale&#10;and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my&#10;ears: but still they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more&#10;distinct:--It continued and became more distinct: I talked more&#10;freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained&#10;definiteness--until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my&#10;ears.&#10;&#10;No doubt I now grew _very_ pale;--but I talked more fluently, and with a&#10;heightened voice. Yet the sound increased--and what could I do? It was&#10;a low, dull, quick sound--much such a sound as a watch makes when&#10;enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath--and yet the officers heard&#10;it not. I talked more quickly--more vehemently; but the noise steadily&#10;increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with&#10;violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why would&#10;they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if&#10;excited to fury by the observations of the men--but the noise steadily&#10;increased. Oh God! what could I do? I foamed--I raved--I swore! I swung&#10;the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the&#10;boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It&#10;grew louder--louder--louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and&#10;smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God!--no, no! They&#10;heard!--they suspected!--they knew!--they were making a mockery of my&#10;horror!-this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better than&#10;this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear&#10;those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die!&#10;and now--again!--hark! louder! louder! louder! louder!&#10;&#10;&quot;Villains!&quot; I shrieked, &quot;dissemble no more! I admit the deed!--tear up&#10;the planks! here, here!--It is the beating of his hideous heart!&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;BERENICE&#10;&#10;     Dicebant mihi sodales, si sepulchrum amicae visitarem, curas&#10;     meas aliquantulum forelevatas.&#10;&#10;                                 --_Ebn Zaiat_.&#10;&#10;MISERY is manifold. The wretchedness of earth is multiform. Overreaching&#10;the wide horizon as the rainbow, its hues are as various as the hues of&#10;that arch--as distinct too, yet as intimately blended. Overreaching the&#10;wide horizon as the rainbow! How is it that from beauty I have derived&#10;a type of unloveliness?--from the covenant of peace, a simile of sorrow?&#10;But as, in ethics, evil is a consequence of good, so, in fact, out of&#10;joy is sorrow born. Either the memory of past bliss is the anguish of&#10;to-day, or the agonies which _are_, have their origin in the ecstasies&#10;which _might have been_.&#10;&#10;My baptismal name is Egaeus; that of my family I will not mention. Yet&#10;there are no towers in the land more time-honored than my gloomy, gray,&#10;hereditary halls. Our line has been called a race of visionaries; and&#10;in many striking particulars--in the character of the family&#10;mansion--in the frescos of the chief saloon--in the tapestries of the&#10;dormitories--in the chiselling of some buttresses in the armory--but&#10;more especially in the gallery of antique paintings--in the fashion of&#10;the library chamber--and, lastly, in the very peculiar nature of the&#10;library's contents--there is more than sufficient evidence to warrant&#10;the belief.&#10;&#10;The recollections of my earliest years are connected with that chamber,&#10;and with its volumes--of which latter I will say no more. Here died my&#10;mother. Herein was I born. But it is mere idleness to say that I had not&#10;lived before--that the soul has no previous existence. You deny it?--let&#10;us not argue the matter. Convinced myself, I seek not to convince. There&#10;is, however, a remembrance of aerial forms--of spiritual and meaning&#10;eyes--of sounds, musical yet sad--a remembrance which will not be&#10;excluded; a memory like a shadow--vague, variable, indefinite, unsteady;&#10;and like a shadow, too, in the impossibility of my getting rid of it&#10;while the sunlight of my reason shall exist.&#10;&#10;In that chamber was I born. Thus awaking from the long night of what&#10;seemed, but was not, nonentity, at once into the very regions of fairy&#10;land--into a palace of imagination--into the wild dominions of monastic&#10;thought and erudition--it is not singular that I gazed around me with a&#10;startled and ardent eye--that I loitered away my boyhood in books,&#10;and dissipated my youth in reverie; but it _is_ singular that as years&#10;rolled away, and the noon of manhood found me still in the mansion of my&#10;fathers--it _is_ wonderful what stagnation there fell upon the springs&#10;of my life--wonderful how total an inversion took place in the character&#10;of my commonest thought. The realities of the world affected me as&#10;visions, and as visions only, while the wild ideas of the land of dreams&#10;became, in turn, not the material of my every-day existence, but in very&#10;deed that existence utterly and solely in itself.&#10;&#10;* * * * *&#10;&#10;Berenice and I were cousins, and we grew up together in my paternal&#10;halls. Yet differently we grew--I, ill of health, and buried in&#10;gloom--she, agile, graceful, and overflowing with energy; hers, the&#10;ramble on the hill-side--mine the studies of the cloister; I, living&#10;within my own heart, and addicted, body and soul, to the most intense&#10;and painful meditation--she, roaming carelessly through life, with&#10;no thought of the shadows in her path, or the silent flight of the&#10;raven-winged hours. Berenice!--I call upon her name--Berenice!--and&#10;from the gray ruins of memory a thousand tumultuous recollections are&#10;startled at the sound! Ah, vividly is her image before me now, as in the&#10;early days of her light-heartedness and joy! Oh, gorgeous yet fantastic&#10;beauty! Oh, sylph amid the shrubberies of Arnheim! Oh, Naiad among its&#10;fountains! And then--then all is mystery and terror, and a tale which&#10;should not be told. Disease--a fatal disease, fell like the simoon upon&#10;her frame; and, even while I gazed upon her, the spirit of change swept&#10;over her, pervading her mind, her habits, and her character, and, in a&#10;manner the most subtle and terrible, disturbing even the identity of&#10;her person! Alas! the destroyer came and went!--and the victim--where is&#10;she? I knew her not--or knew her no longer as Berenice.&#10;&#10;Among the numerous train of maladies superinduced by that fatal and&#10;primary one which effected a revolution of so horrible a kind in the&#10;moral and physical being of my cousin, may be mentioned as the most&#10;distressing and obstinate in its nature, a species of epilepsy not&#10;unfrequently terminating in _trance_ itself--trance very nearly&#10;resembling positive dissolution, and from which her manner of recovery&#10;was in most instances, startlingly abrupt. In the mean time my own&#10;disease--for I have been told that I should call it by no other&#10;appellation--my own disease, then, grew rapidly upon me, and assumed&#10;finally a monomaniac character of a novel and extraordinary form--hourly&#10;and momently gaining vigor--and at length obtaining over me the most&#10;incomprehensible ascendancy. This monomania, if I must so term it,&#10;consisted in a morbid irritability of those properties of the mind in&#10;metaphysical science termed the _attentive_. It is more than probable&#10;that I am not understood; but I fear, indeed, that it is in no manner&#10;possible to convey to the mind of the merely general reader, an adequate&#10;idea of that nervous _intensity of interest_ with which, in my case,&#10;the powers of meditation (not to speak technically) busied and buried&#10;themselves, in the contemplation of even the most ordinary objects of&#10;the universe.&#10;&#10;To muse for long unwearied hours, with my attention riveted to some&#10;frivolous device on the margin, or in the typography of a book; to&#10;become absorbed, for the better part of a summer's day, in a quaint&#10;shadow falling aslant upon the tapestry or upon the floor; to lose&#10;myself, for an entire night, in watching the steady flame of a lamp,&#10;or the embers of a fire; to dream away whole days over the perfume of a&#10;flower; to repeat, monotonously, some common word, until the sound, by&#10;dint of frequent repetition, ceased to convey any idea whatever to the&#10;mind; to lose all sense of motion or physical existence, by means of&#10;absolute bodily quiescence long and obstinately persevered in: such&#10;were a few of the most common and least pernicious vagaries induced by a&#10;condition of the mental faculties, not, indeed, altogether unparalleled,&#10;but certainly bidding defiance to anything like analysis or explanation.&#10;&#10;Yet let me not be misapprehended. The undue, earnest, and morbid&#10;attention thus excited by objects in their own nature frivolous, must&#10;not be confounded in character with that ruminating propensity common&#10;to all mankind, and more especially indulged in by persons of ardent&#10;imagination. It was not even, as might be at first supposed, an extreme&#10;condition, or exaggeration of such propensity, but primarily and&#10;essentially distinct and different. In the one instance, the dreamer,&#10;or enthusiast, being interested by an object usually _not_ frivolous,&#10;imperceptibly loses sight of this object in a wilderness of deductions&#10;and suggestions issuing therefrom, until, at the conclusion of a day&#10;dream _often replete with luxury_, he finds the _incitamentum_, or first&#10;cause of his musings, entirely vanished and forgotten. In my case, the&#10;primary object was _invariably frivolous_, although assuming, through&#10;the medium of my distempered vision, a refracted and unreal importance.&#10;Few deductions, if any, were made; and those few pertinaciously&#10;returning in upon the original object as a centre. The meditations were&#10;_never_ pleasurable; and, at the termination of the reverie, the first&#10;cause, so far from being out of sight, had attained that supernaturally&#10;exaggerated interest which was the prevailing feature of the disease. In&#10;a word, the powers of mind more particularly exercised were, with me, as&#10;I have said before, the _attentive_, and are, with the day-dreamer, the&#10;_speculative_.&#10;&#10;My books, at this epoch, if they did not actually serve to irritate the&#10;disorder, partook, it will be perceived, largely, in their imaginative&#10;and inconsequential nature, of the characteristic qualities of the&#10;disorder itself. I well remember, among others, the treatise of the&#10;noble Italian, Coelius Secundus Curio, &quot;_De Amplitudine Beati Regni&#10;Dei;_&quot; St. Austin's great work, the &quot;City of God;&quot; and Tertullian's &quot;_De&#10;Carne Christi_,&quot; in which the paradoxical sentence &quot;_Mortuus est Dei&#10;filius; credible est quia ineptum est: et sepultus resurrexit; certum&#10;est quia impossibile est,_&quot; occupied my undivided time, for many weeks&#10;of laborious and fruitless investigation.&#10;&#10;Thus it will appear that, shaken from its balance only by trivial&#10;things, my reason bore resemblance to that ocean-crag spoken of by&#10;Ptolemy Hephestion, which steadily resisting the attacks of human&#10;violence, and the fiercer fury of the waters and the winds, trembled&#10;only to the touch of the flower called Asphodel. And although, to&#10;a careless thinker, it might appear a matter beyond doubt, that the&#10;alteration produced by her unhappy malady, in the _moral_ condition of&#10;Berenice, would afford me many objects for the exercise of that intense&#10;and abnormal meditation whose nature I have been at some trouble in&#10;explaining, yet such was not in any degree the case. In the lucid&#10;intervals of my infirmity, her calamity, indeed, gave me pain, and,&#10;taking deeply to heart that total wreck of her fair and gentle life, I&#10;did not fail to ponder, frequently and bitterly, upon the wonder-working&#10;means by which so strange a revolution had been so suddenly brought&#10;to pass. But these reflections partook not of the idiosyncrasy of&#10;my disease, and were such as would have occurred, under similar&#10;circumstances, to the ordinary mass of mankind. True to its own&#10;character, my disorder revelled in the less important but more startling&#10;changes wrought in the _physical_ frame of Berenice--in the singular and&#10;most appalling distortion of her personal identity.&#10;&#10;During the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty, most surely I had&#10;never loved her. In the strange anomaly of my existence, feelings with&#10;me, _had never been_ of the heart, and my passions _always were_ of the&#10;mind. Through the gray of the early morning--among the trellised shadows&#10;of the forest at noonday--and in the silence of my library at night--she&#10;had flitted by my eyes, and I had seen her--not as the living and&#10;breathing Berenice, but as the Berenice of a dream; not as a being of&#10;the earth, earthy, but as the abstraction of such a being; not as a&#10;thing to admire, but to analyze; not as an object of love, but as&#10;the theme of the most abstruse although desultory speculation. And&#10;_now_--now I shuddered in her presence, and grew pale at her approach;&#10;yet, bitterly lamenting her fallen and desolate condition, I called to&#10;mind that she had loved me long, and, in an evil moment, I spoke to her&#10;of marriage.&#10;&#10;And at length the period of our nuptials was approaching, when, upon&#10;an afternoon in the winter of the year--one of those unseasonably&#10;warm, calm, and misty days which are the nurse of the beautiful Halcyon&#10;(*1),--I sat, (and sat, as I thought, alone,) in the inner apartment of&#10;the library. But, uplifting my eyes, I saw that Berenice stood before&#10;me.&#10;&#10;Was it my own excited imagination--or the misty influence of the&#10;atmosphere--or the uncertain twilight of the chamber--or the gray&#10;draperies which fell around her figure--that caused in it so vacillating&#10;and indistinct an outline? I could not tell. She spoke no word; and&#10;I--not for worlds could I have uttered a syllable. An icy chill ran&#10;through my frame; a sense of insufferable anxiety oppressed me; a&#10;consuming curiosity pervaded my soul; and sinking back upon the chair,&#10;I remained for some time breathless and motionless, with my eyes riveted&#10;upon her person. Alas! its emaciation was excessive, and not one vestige&#10;of the former being lurked in any single line of the contour. My burning&#10;glances at length fell upon the face.&#10;&#10;The forehead was high, and very pale, and singularly placid; and the&#10;once jetty hair fell partially over it, and overshadowed the hollow&#10;temples with innumerable ringlets, now of a vivid yellow, and jarring&#10;discordantly, in their fantastic character, with the reigning melancholy&#10;of the countenance. The eyes were lifeless, and lustreless, and&#10;seemingly pupilless, and I shrank involuntarily from their glassy stare&#10;to the contemplation of the thin and shrunken lips. They parted; and in a&#10;smile of peculiar meaning, _the teeth_ of the changed Berenice disclosed&#10;themselves slowly to my view. Would to God that I had never beheld them,&#10;or that, having done so, I had died!&#10;&#10;* * * * *&#10;&#10;The shutting of a door disturbed me, and, looking up, I found that my&#10;cousin had departed from the chamber. But from the disordered chamber&#10;of my brain, had not, alas! departed, and would not be driven away,&#10;the white and ghastly _spectrum_ of the teeth. Not a speck on their&#10;surface--not a shade on their enamel--not an indenture in their&#10;edges--but what that period of her smile had sufficed to brand in upon&#10;my memory. I saw them _now_ even more unequivocally than I beheld&#10;them _then_. The teeth!--the teeth!--they were here, and there, and&#10;everywhere, and visibly and palpably before me; long, narrow, and&#10;excessively white, with the pale lips writhing about them, as in the&#10;very moment of their first terrible development. Then came the full&#10;fury of my _monomania_, and I struggled in vain against its strange and&#10;irresistible influence. In the multiplied objects of the external world&#10;I had no thoughts but for the teeth. For these I longed with a phrenzied&#10;desire. All other matters and all different interests became absorbed in&#10;their single contemplation. They--they alone were present to the mental&#10;eye, and they, in their sole individuality, became the essence of&#10;my mental life. I held them in every light. I turned them in every&#10;attitude. I surveyed their characteristics. I dwelt upon their&#10;peculiarities. I pondered upon their conformation. I mused upon the&#10;alteration in their nature. I shuddered as I assigned to them in&#10;imagination a sensitive and sentient power, and even when unassisted by&#10;the lips, a capability of moral expression. Of Mademoiselle Salle it&#10;has been well said, &quot;_Que tous ses pas etaient des sentiments_,&quot; and&#10;of Berenice I more seriously believed _que toutes ses dents etaient des&#10;idees_. _Des idees!_--ah here was the idiotic thought that destroyed me!&#10;_Des idees!_--ah _therefore_ it was that I coveted them so madly! I felt&#10;that their possession could alone ever restore me to peace, in giving me&#10;back to reason.&#10;&#10;And the evening closed in upon me thus--and then the darkness came, and&#10;tarried, and went--and the day again dawned--and the mists of a second&#10;night were now gathering around--and still I sat motionless in that&#10;solitary room--and still I sat buried in meditation--and still the&#10;_phantasma_ of the teeth maintained its terrible ascendancy, as, with&#10;the most vivid hideous distinctness, it floated about amid the changing&#10;lights and shadows of the chamber. At length there broke in upon my&#10;dreams a cry as of horror and dismay; and thereunto, after a pause,&#10;succeeded the sound of troubled voices, intermingled with many low&#10;moanings of sorrow or of pain. I arose from my seat, and throwing open&#10;one of the doors of the library, saw standing out in the ante-chamber&#10;a servant maiden, all in tears, who told me that Berenice was--no more!&#10;She had been seized with epilepsy in the early morning, and now, at the&#10;closing in of the night, the grave was ready for its tenant, and all the&#10;preparations for the burial were completed.&#10;&#10;* * * * *&#10;&#10;I found myself sitting in the library, and again sitting there alone. It&#10;seemed that I had newly awakened from a confused and exciting dream.&#10;I knew that it was now midnight, and I was well aware, that since the&#10;setting of the sun, Berenice had been interred. But of that dreary&#10;period which intervened I had no positive, at least no definite&#10;comprehension. Yet its memory was replete with horror--horror more&#10;horrible from being vague, and terror more terrible from ambiguity. It&#10;was a fearful page in the record my existence, written all over with&#10;dim, and hideous, and unintelligible recollections. I strived to&#10;decypher them, but in vain; while ever and anon, like the spirit of a&#10;departed sound, the shrill and piercing shriek of a female voice seemed&#10;to be ringing in my ears. I had done a deed--what was it? I asked myself&#10;the question aloud, and the whispering echoes of the chamber answered&#10;me,--&quot;_what was it?_&quot;&#10;&#10;On the table beside me burned a lamp, and near it lay a little box. It&#10;was of no remarkable character, and I had seen it frequently before, for&#10;it was the property of the family physician; but how came it _there_,&#10;upon my table, and why did I shudder in regarding it? These things were&#10;in no manner to be accounted for, and my eyes at length dropped to the&#10;open pages of a book, and to a sentence underscored therein. The words&#10;were the singular but simple ones of the poet Ebn Zaiat:--&quot;_Dicebant&#10;mihi sodales si sepulchrum amicae visitarem, curas meas aliquantulum&#10;fore levatas_.&quot; Why then, as I perused them, did the hairs of my head&#10;erect themselves on end, and the blood of my body become congealed&#10;within my veins?&#10;&#10;There came a light tap at the library door--and, pale as the tenant of a&#10;tomb, a menial entered upon tiptoe. His looks were wild with terror,&#10;and he spoke to me in a voice tremulous, husky, and very low. What said&#10;he?--some broken sentences I heard. He told of a wild cry disturbing the&#10;silence of the night--of the gathering together of the household--of&#10;a search in the direction of the sound; and then his tones grew&#10;thrillingly distinct as he whispered me of a violated grave--of&#10;a disfigured body enshrouded, yet still breathing--still&#10;palpitating--_still alive_!&#10;&#10;He pointed to garments;--they were muddy and clotted with gore. I spoke&#10;not, and he took me gently by the hand: it was indented with the impress&#10;of human nails. He directed my attention to some object against the&#10;wall. I looked at it for some minutes: it was a spade. With a shriek I&#10;bounded to the table, and grasped the box that lay upon it. But I could&#10;not force it open; and in my tremor, it slipped from my hands, and fell&#10;heavily, and burst into pieces; and from it, with a rattling sound,&#10;there rolled out some instruments of dental surgery, intermingled with&#10;thirty-two small, white and ivory-looking substances that were scattered&#10;to and fro about the floor.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;ELEONORA&#10;&#10;     Sub conservatione formae specificae salva anima.&#10;&#10;                        _  Raymond Lully_.&#10;&#10;I AM come of a race noted for vigor of fancy and ardor of passion. Men&#10;have called me mad; but the question is not yet settled, whether&#10;madness is or is not the loftiest intelligence--whether much that is&#10;glorious--whether all that is profound--does not spring from disease&#10;of thought--from moods of mind exalted at the expense of the general&#10;intellect. They who dream by day are cognizant of many things which&#10;escape those who dream only by night. In their gray visions they obtain&#10;glimpses of eternity, and thrill, in awakening, to find that they&#10;have been upon the verge of the great secret. In snatches, they learn&#10;something of the wisdom which is of good, and more of the mere knowledge&#10;which is of evil. They penetrate, however, rudderless or compassless&#10;into the vast ocean of the &quot;light ineffable,&quot; and again, like the&#10;adventures of the Nubian geographer, &quot;agressi sunt mare tenebrarum, quid&#10;in eo esset exploraturi.&quot;&#10;&#10;We will say, then, that I am mad. I grant, at least, that there are two&#10;distinct conditions of my mental existence--the condition of a lucid&#10;reason, not to be disputed, and belonging to the memory of events&#10;forming the first epoch of my life--and a condition of shadow and doubt,&#10;appertaining to the present, and to the recollection of what constitutes&#10;the second great era of my being. Therefore, what I shall tell of the&#10;earlier period, believe; and to what I may relate of the later time,&#10;give only such credit as may seem due, or doubt it altogether, or, if&#10;doubt it ye cannot, then play unto its riddle the Oedipus.&#10;&#10;She whom I loved in youth, and of whom I now pen calmly and distinctly&#10;these remembrances, was the sole daughter of the only sister of my&#10;mother long departed. Eleonora was the name of my cousin. We had&#10;always dwelled together, beneath a tropical sun, in the Valley of the&#10;Many-Colored Grass. No unguided footstep ever came upon that vale; for&#10;it lay away up among a range of giant hills that hung beetling around&#10;about it, shutting out the sunlight from its sweetest recesses. No path&#10;was trodden in its vicinity; and, to reach our happy home, there was&#10;need of putting back, with force, the foliage of many thousands of&#10;forest trees, and of crushing to death the glories of many millions of&#10;fragrant flowers. Thus it was that we lived all alone, knowing nothing&#10;of the world without the valley--I, and my cousin, and her mother.&#10;&#10;From the dim regions beyond the mountains at the upper end of our&#10;encircled domain, there crept out a narrow and deep river, brighter than&#10;all save the eyes of Eleonora; and, winding stealthily about in mazy&#10;courses, it passed away, at length, through a shadowy gorge, among hills&#10;still dimmer than those whence it had issued. We called it the &quot;River&#10;of Silence&quot;; for there seemed to be a hushing influence in its flow.&#10;No murmur arose from its bed, and so gently it wandered along, that the&#10;pearly pebbles upon which we loved to gaze, far down within its bosom,&#10;stirred not at all, but lay in a motionless content, each in its own old&#10;station, shining on gloriously forever.&#10;&#10;The margin of the river, and of the many dazzling rivulets that glided&#10;through devious ways into its channel, as well as the spaces that&#10;extended from the margins away down into the depths of the streams until&#10;they reached the bed of pebbles at the bottom,--these spots, not less&#10;than the whole surface of the valley, from the river to the mountains&#10;that girdled it in, were carpeted all by a soft green grass, thick,&#10;short, perfectly even, and vanilla-perfumed, but so besprinkled&#10;throughout with the yellow buttercup, the white daisy, the purple&#10;violet, and the ruby-red asphodel, that its exceeding beauty spoke to&#10;our hearts in loud tones, of the love and of the glory of God.&#10;&#10;And, here and there, in groves about this grass, like wildernesses of&#10;dreams, sprang up fantastic trees, whose tall slender stems stood not&#10;upright, but slanted gracefully toward the light that peered at noon-day&#10;into the centre of the valley. Their mark was speckled with the vivid&#10;alternate splendor of ebony and silver, and was smoother than all save&#10;the cheeks of Eleonora; so that, but for the brilliant green of the huge&#10;leaves that spread from their summits in long, tremulous lines, dallying&#10;with the Zephyrs, one might have fancied them giant serpents of Syria&#10;doing homage to their sovereign the Sun.&#10;&#10;Hand in hand about this valley, for fifteen years, roamed I with&#10;Eleonora before Love entered within our hearts. It was one evening at&#10;the close of the third lustrum of her life, and of the fourth of my own,&#10;that we sat, locked in each other's embrace, beneath the serpent-like&#10;trees, and looked down within the water of the River of Silence at our&#10;images therein. We spoke no words during the rest of that sweet day, and&#10;our words even upon the morrow were tremulous and few. We had drawn the&#10;God Eros from that wave, and now we felt that he had enkindled within us&#10;the fiery souls of our forefathers. The passions which had for centuries&#10;distinguished our race, came thronging with the fancies for which they&#10;had been equally noted, and together breathed a delirious bliss over&#10;the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass. A change fell upon all things.&#10;Strange, brilliant flowers, star-shaped, burn out upon the trees&#10;where no flowers had been known before. The tints of the green carpet&#10;deepened; and when, one by one, the white daisies shrank away, there&#10;sprang up in place of them, ten by ten of the ruby-red asphodel. And&#10;life arose in our paths; for the tall flamingo, hitherto unseen, with&#10;all gay glowing birds, flaunted his scarlet plumage before us. The&#10;golden and silver fish haunted the river, out of the bosom of which&#10;issued, little by little, a murmur that swelled, at length, into a&#10;lulling melody more divine than that of the harp of Aeolus-sweeter than&#10;all save the voice of Eleonora. And now, too, a voluminous cloud, which&#10;we had long watched in the regions of Hesper, floated out thence, all&#10;gorgeous in crimson and gold, and settling in peace above us, sank, day&#10;by day, lower and lower, until its edges rested upon the tops of the&#10;mountains, turning all their dimness into magnificence, and shutting us&#10;up, as if forever, within a magic prison-house of grandeur and of glory.&#10;&#10;The loveliness of Eleonora was that of the Seraphim; but she was a&#10;maiden artless and innocent as the brief life she had led among the&#10;flowers. No guile disguised the fervor of love which animated her heart,&#10;and she examined with me its inmost recesses as we walked together&#10;in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass, and discoursed of the mighty&#10;changes which had lately taken place therein.&#10;&#10;At length, having spoken one day, in tears, of the last sad change&#10;which must befall Humanity, she thenceforward dwelt only upon this one&#10;sorrowful theme, interweaving it into all our converse, as, in the songs&#10;of the bard of Schiraz, the same images are found occurring, again and&#10;again, in every impressive variation of phrase.&#10;&#10;She had seen that the finger of Death was upon her bosom--that, like the&#10;ephemeron, she had been made perfect in loveliness only to die; but&#10;the terrors of the grave to her lay solely in a consideration which she&#10;revealed to me, one evening at twilight, by the banks of the River of&#10;Silence. She grieved to think that, having entombed her in the Valley&#10;of the Many-Colored Grass, I would quit forever its happy recesses,&#10;transferring the love which now was so passionately her own to some&#10;maiden of the outer and everyday world. And, then and there, I threw&#10;myself hurriedly at the feet of Eleonora, and offered up a vow, to&#10;herself and to Heaven, that I would never bind myself in marriage to any&#10;daughter of Earth--that I would in no manner prove recreant to her dear&#10;memory, or to the memory of the devout affection with which she had&#10;blessed me. And I called the Mighty Ruler of the Universe to witness the&#10;pious solemnity of my vow. And the curse which I invoked of Him and&#10;of her, a saint in Helusion should I prove traitorous to that promise,&#10;involved a penalty the exceeding great horror of which will not permit&#10;me to make record of it here. And the bright eyes of Eleonora grew&#10;brighter at my words; and she sighed as if a deadly burthen had been&#10;taken from her breast; and she trembled and very bitterly wept; but she&#10;made acceptance of the vow, (for what was she but a child?) and it made&#10;easy to her the bed of her death. And she said to me, not many days&#10;afterward, tranquilly dying, that, because of what I had done for&#10;the comfort of her spirit she would watch over me in that spirit when&#10;departed, and, if so it were permitted her return to me visibly in the&#10;watches of the night; but, if this thing were, indeed, beyond the power&#10;of the souls in Paradise, that she would, at least, give me frequent&#10;indications of her presence, sighing upon me in the evening winds, or&#10;filling the air which I breathed with perfume from the censers of the&#10;angels. And, with these words upon her lips, she yielded up her innocent&#10;life, putting an end to the first epoch of my own.&#10;&#10;Thus far I have faithfully said. But as I pass the barrier in Time's&#10;path, formed by the death of my beloved, and proceed with the second&#10;era of my existence, I feel that a shadow gathers over my brain, and I&#10;mistrust the perfect sanity of the record. But let me on.--Years dragged&#10;themselves along heavily, and still I dwelled within the Valley of the&#10;Many-Colored Grass; but a second change had come upon all things. The&#10;star-shaped flowers shrank into the stems of the trees, and appeared no&#10;more. The tints of the green carpet faded; and, one by one, the ruby-red&#10;asphodels withered away; and there sprang up, in place of them, ten&#10;by ten, dark, eye-like violets, that writhed uneasily and were ever&#10;encumbered with dew. And Life departed from our paths; for the tall&#10;flamingo flaunted no longer his scarlet plumage before us, but flew&#10;sadly from the vale into the hills, with all the gay glowing birds that&#10;had arrived in his company. And the golden and silver fish swam down&#10;through the gorge at the lower end of our domain and bedecked the sweet&#10;river never again. And the lulling melody that had been softer than&#10;the wind-harp of Aeolus, and more divine than all save the voice of&#10;Eleonora, it died little by little away, in murmurs growing lower and&#10;lower, until the stream returned, at length, utterly, into the solemnity&#10;of its original silence. And then, lastly, the voluminous cloud uprose,&#10;and, abandoning the tops of the mountains to the dimness of old, fell&#10;back into the regions of Hesper, and took away all its manifold golden&#10;and gorgeous glories from the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass.&#10;&#10;Yet the promises of Eleonora were not forgotten; for I heard the sounds&#10;of the swinging of the censers of the angels; and streams of a holy&#10;perfume floated ever and ever about the valley; and at lone hours, when&#10;my heart beat heavily, the winds that bathed my brow came unto me laden&#10;with soft sighs; and indistinct murmurs filled often the night air, and&#10;once--oh, but once only! I was awakened from a slumber, like the slumber&#10;of death, by the pressing of spiritual lips upon my own.&#10;&#10;But the void within my heart refused, even thus, to be filled. I longed&#10;for the love which had before filled it to overflowing. At length the&#10;valley pained me through its memories of Eleonora, and I left it for&#10;ever for the vanities and the turbulent triumphs of the world.&#10;&#10;I found myself within a strange city, where all things might have served&#10;to blot from recollection the sweet dreams I had dreamed so long in the&#10;Valley of the Many-Colored Grass. The pomps and pageantries of a stately&#10;court, and the mad clangor of arms, and the radiant loveliness of women,&#10;bewildered and intoxicated my brain. But as yet my soul had proved true&#10;to its vows, and the indications of the presence of Eleonora were still&#10;given me in the silent hours of the night. Suddenly these manifestations&#10;they ceased, and the world grew dark before mine eyes, and I stood&#10;aghast at the burning thoughts which possessed, at the terrible&#10;temptations which beset me; for there came from some far, far distant&#10;and unknown land, into the gay court of the king I served, a maiden to&#10;whose beauty my whole recreant heart yielded at once--at whose footstool&#10;I bowed down without a struggle, in the most ardent, in the most abject&#10;worship of love. What, indeed, was my passion for the young girl of&#10;the valley in comparison with the fervor, and the delirium, and the&#10;spirit-lifting ecstasy of adoration with which I poured out my whole&#10;soul in tears at the feet of the ethereal Ermengarde?--Oh, bright&#10;was the seraph Ermengarde! and in that knowledge I had room for none&#10;other.--Oh, divine was the angel Ermengarde! and as I looked down into&#10;the depths of her memorial eyes, I thought only of them--and of her.&#10;&#10;I wedded;--nor dreaded the curse I had invoked; and its bitterness was&#10;not visited upon me. And once--but once again in the silence of the&#10;night; there came through my lattice the soft sighs which had forsaken&#10;me; and they modelled themselves into familiar and sweet voice, saying:&#10;&#10;&quot;Sleep in peace!--for the Spirit of Love reigneth and ruleth, and, in&#10;taking to thy passionate heart her who is Ermengarde, thou art absolved,&#10;for reasons which shall be made known to thee in Heaven, of thy vows&#10;unto Eleonora.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;NOTES TO THIS VOLUME&#10;&#10;Notes -- Scheherezade&#10;&#10;(*1) The coralites.&#10;&#10;(*2) &quot;One of the most remarkable natural curiosities in Texas is a&#10;petrified forest, near the head of Pasigno river. It consists of several&#10;hundred trees, in an erect position, all turned to stone. Some trees,&#10;now growing, are partly petrified. This is a startling fact for natural&#10;philosophers, and must cause them to modify the existing theory of&#10;petrification.--_Kennedy_.&#10;&#10;This account, at first discredited, has since been corroborated by the&#10;discovery of a completely petrified forest, near the head waters of the&#10;Cheyenne, or Chienne river, which has its source in the Black Hills of&#10;the rocky chain.&#10;&#10;There is scarcely, perhaps, a spectacle on the surface of the globe more&#10;remarkable, either in a geological or picturesque point of view than&#10;that presented by the petrified forest, near Cairo. The traveller,&#10;having passed the tombs of the caliphs, just beyond the gates of the&#10;city, proceeds to the southward, nearly at right angles to the road&#10;across the desert to Suez, and after having travelled some ten miles up&#10;a low barren valley, covered with sand, gravel, and sea shells, fresh as&#10;if the tide had retired but yesterday, crosses a low range of sandhills,&#10;which has for some distance run parallel to his path. The scene now&#10;presented to him is beyond conception singular and desolate. A mass of&#10;fragments of trees, all converted into stone, and when struck by his&#10;horse's hoof ringing like cast iron, is seen to extend itself for miles&#10;and miles around him, in the form of a decayed and prostrate forest.&#10;The wood is of a dark brown hue, but retains its form in perfection, the&#10;pieces being from one to fifteen feet in length, and from half a foot to&#10;three feet in thickness, strewed so closely together, as far as the eye&#10;can reach, that an Egyptian donkey can scarcely thread its way through&#10;amongst them, and so natural that, were it in Scotland or Ireland, it&#10;might pass without remark for some enormous drained bog, on which the&#10;exhumed trees lay rotting in the sun. The roots and rudiments of the&#10;branches are, in many cases, nearly perfect, and in some the worm-holes&#10;eaten under the bark are readily recognizable. The most delicate of the&#10;sap vessels, and all the finer portions of the centre of the wood, are&#10;perfectly entire, and bear to be examined with the strongest magnifiers.&#10;The whole are so thoroughly silicified as to scratch glass and are&#10;capable of receiving the highest polish.-- _Asiatic Magazine_.&#10;&#10;(*3) The Mammoth Cave of Kentucky.&#10;&#10;(*4) In Iceland, 1783.&#10;&#10;(*5) &quot;During the eruption of Hecla, in 1766, clouds of this kind&#10;produced such a degree of darkness that, at Glaumba, which is more than&#10;fifty leagues from the mountain, people could only find their way by&#10;groping. During the eruption of Vesuvius, in 1794, at Caserta, four&#10;leagues distant, people could only walk by the light of torches. On the&#10;first of May, 1812, a cloud of volcanic ashes and sand, coming from a&#10;volcano in the island of St. Vincent, covered the whole of Barbadoes,&#10;spreading over it so intense a darkness that, at mid-day, in the open&#10;air, one could not perceive the trees or other objects near him, or&#10;even a white handkerchief placed at the distance of six inches from the&#10;eye._&quot;--Murray, p. 215, Phil. edit._&#10;&#10;(*6) In the year 1790, in the Caraccas during an earthquake a portion of&#10;the granite soil sank and left a lake eight hundred yards in diameter,&#10;and from eighty to a hundred feet deep.

Of this class are the _Fuci_ and&#10;_Algae_.&#10;&#10;_Mr. J. B. Williams, of Salem, Mass._, presented the &quot;National&#10;Institute&quot; with an insect from New Zealand, with the following&#10;description: &quot;'_The Hotte_, a decided caterpillar, or worm, is found&#10;gnawing at the root of the _Rota_ tree, with a plant growing out of its&#10;head. This most peculiar and extraordinary insect travels up both the&#10;_Rota_ and _Ferriri_ trees, and entering into the top, eats its way,&#10;perforating the trunk of the trees until it reaches the root, and dies,&#10;or remains dormant, and the plant propagates out of its head; the body&#10;remains perfect and entire, of a harder substance than when alive. From&#10;this insect the natives make a coloring for tattooing.&#10;&#10;(*13) In mines and natural caves we find a species of cryptogamous&#10;_fungus_ that emits an intense phosphorescence.&#10;&#10;(*14) The orchis, scabius and valisneria.&#10;&#10;(*15) The corolla of this flower (_Aristolochia Clematitis_), which is&#10;tubular, but terminating upwards in a ligulate limb, is inflated into a&#10;globular figure at the base. The tubular part is internally beset with&#10;stiff hairs, pointing downwards. The globular part contains the&#10;pistil, which consists merely of a germen and stigma, together with the&#10;surrounding stamens. But the stamens, being shorter than the germen,&#10;cannot discharge the pollen so as to throw it upon the stigma, as the&#10;flower stands always upright till after impregnation. And hence, without&#10;some additional and peculiar aid, the pollen must necessarily fan down&#10;to the bottom of the flower. Now, the aid that nature has furnished in&#10;this case, is that of the _Tiputa Pennicornis_, a small insect, which&#10;entering the tube of the corrolla in quest of honey, descends to the&#10;bottom, and rummages about till it becomes quite covered with pollen;&#10;but not being able to force its way out again, owing to the downward&#10;position of the hairs, which converge to a point like the wires of a&#10;mouse-trap, and being somewhat impatient of its confinement it brushes&#10;backwards and forwards, trying every corner, till, after repeatedly&#10;traversing the stigma, it covers it with pollen sufficient for its&#10;impregnation, in consequence of which the flower soon begins to droop,&#10;and the hairs to shrink to the sides of the tube, effecting an easy&#10;passage for the escape of the insect.&quot;--_Rev. P. Keith-System of&#10;Physiological Botany_.&#10;&#10;(*16) The bees--ever since bees were--have been constructing their&#10;cells with just such sides, in just such number, and at just such&#10;inclinations, as it has been demonstrated (in a problem involving the&#10;profoundest mathematical principles) are the very sides, in the very&#10;number, and at the very angles, which will afford the creatures the most&#10;room that is compatible with the greatest stability of structure.&#10;&#10;During the latter part of the last century, the question arose among&#10;mathematicians--&quot;to determine the best form that can be given to the&#10;sails of a windmill, according to their varying distances from the&#10;revolving vanes, and likewise from the centres of the revoloution.&quot; This&#10;is an excessively complex problem, for it is, in other words, to find&#10;the best possible position at an infinity of varied distances and at an&#10;infinity of points on the arm. There were a thousand futile attempts to&#10;answer the query on the part of the most illustrious mathematicians, and&#10;when at length, an undeniable solution was discovered, men found that&#10;the wings of a bird had given it with absolute precision ever since the&#10;first bird had traversed the air.&#10;&#10;(*17) He observed a flock of pigeons passing betwixt Frankfort and the&#10;Indian territory, one mile at least in breadth; it took up four hours&#10;in passing, which, at the rate of one mile per minute, gives a length&#10;of 240 miles; and, supposing three pigeons to each square yard, gives&#10;2,230,272,000 Pigeons.--&quot;_Travels in Canada and the United States,&quot; by&#10;Lieut.

If two red rays from two&#10;luminous points be admitted into a dark chamber so as to fall on a&#10;white surface, and differ in their length by 0.0000258 of an inch,&#10;their intensity is doubled. So also if the difference in length be any&#10;whole-number multiple of that fraction. A multiple by 2 1/4, 3 1/4, &amp;c.,&#10;gives an intensity equal to one ray only; but a multiple by 2 1/2, 3&#10;1/2, &amp;c., gives the result of total darkness. In violet rays similar&#10;effects arise when the difference in length is 0.000157 of an inch; and&#10;with all other rays the results are the same--the difference varying&#10;with a uniform increase from the violet to the red.&#10;&#10;&quot;Analogous experiments in respect to sound produce analogous results.&quot;&#10;&#10;(*32) Place a platina crucible over a spirit lamp, and keep it a red&#10;heat; pour in some sulphuric acid, which, though the most volatile of&#10;bodies at a common temperature, will be found to become completely fixed&#10;in a hot crucible, and not a drop evaporates--being surrounded by an&#10;atmosphere of its own, it does not, in fact, touch the sides. A few&#10;drops of water are now introduced, when the acid, immediately coming in&#10;contact with the heated sides of the crucible, flies off in sulphurous&#10;acid vapor, and so rapid is its progress, that the caloric of the water&#10;passes off with it, which falls a lump of ice to the bottom; by taking&#10;advantage of the moment before it is allowed to remelt, it may be turned&#10;out a lump of ice from a red-hot vessel.&#10;&#10;(*33) The Daguerreotype.&#10;&#10;(*34) Although light travels 167,000 miles in a second, the distance&#10;of 61 Cygni (the only star whose distance is ascertained) is so&#10;inconceivably great, that its rays would require more than ten years to&#10;reach the earth. For stars beyond this, 20--or even 1000 years--would&#10;be a moderate estimate. Thus, if they had been annihilated 20, or 1000&#10;years ago, we might still see them to-day by the light which started&#10;from their surfaces 20 or 1000 years in the past time. That many which&#10;we see daily are really extinct, is not impossible--not even improbable.&#10;&#10;Notes--Maelstrom&#10;&#10;(*1) See Archimedes, &quot;_De Incidentibus in Fluido_.&quot;--lib. 2.&#10;&#10;Notes--Island of the Fay&#10;&#10;(*1) Moraux is here derived from moeurs, and its meaning is&#10;&quot;fashionable&quot; or more strictly &quot;of manners.&quot;&#10;&#10;(*2) Speaking of the tides, Pomponius Mela, in his treatise &quot;De Situ&#10;Orbis,&quot; says &quot;either the world is a great animal, or&quot; etc&#10;&#10;(*3) Balzac--in substance--I do not remember the words&#10;&#10;(*4) Florem putares nare per liquidum aethera.--P.

The germ, and&#10;in fact, the commencement of the present paper was published many years&#10;ago--previous to the issue of the first number of Sue's admirable _Juif&#10;Errant_, which may possibly have been suggested to him by Muskau's&#10;account.&#10;&#10;Notes--Berenice&#10;&#10;(*1) For as Jove, during the winter season, gives twice seven days of&#10;warmth, men have called this element and temperate time the nurse of the&#10;beautiful Halcyon--_Simonides_&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;End of Project Gutenberg's The Works of Edgar Allan Poe, by Edgar Allan Poe&#10;&#10;*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WORKS OF EDGAR ALLAN POE ***&#10;&#10;***** This file should be named 2148-8.txt or 2148-8.zip *****&#10;This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:&#10;        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/1/4/2148/&#10;&#10;Produced by David Widger&#10;&#10;Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions&#10;will be renamed.&#10;&#10;Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no&#10;one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation&#10;(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without&#10;permission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm&#10;&#10;Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of&#10;electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers&#10;including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists&#10;because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from&#10;people in all walks of life.&#10;&#10;Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the&#10;assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's&#10;goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will&#10;remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project&#10;Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure&#10;and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.&#10;To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation&#10;and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4&#10;and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.&#10;&#10;&#10;Section 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg&#10;Literary Archive Foundation&#10;&#10;Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide&#10;spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of&#10;increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be&#10;freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest&#10;array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations&#10;($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt&#10;status with the IRS.&#10;&#10;The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating&#10;charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United&#10;States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a&#10;considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up&#10;with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations&#10;where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To&#10;SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any&#10;particular state visit http://pglaf.org&#10;&#10;While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we&#10;have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition&#10;against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who&#10;approach us with offers to donate.&#10;&#10;International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make&#10;any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from&#10;outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.&#10;&#10;Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation&#10;methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other&#10;ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.&#10;To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate&#10;&#10;&#10;Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic&#10;works.&#10;&#10;Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm&#10;concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared&#10;with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project&#10;Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.&#10;&#10;&#10;Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed&#10;editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.&#10;unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily&#10;keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.&#10;&#10;&#10;Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:&#10;&#10;     http://www.gutenberg.org&#10;&#10;This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,&#10;including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary&#10;Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to&#10;subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.&#10;" creationDate="2022-12-21T10:51:41.154305" fileFormat="GUTEMBERG" fileName="PoeWorksVol2.txt.gut" filePath="/home/biel/Documents/Q5/PROP/subgrup-prop33.2/data/novels/PoeWorksVol2.txt.gut" modificationDate="2022-12-21T10:51:41.154305" title="The Works of Edgar Allan Poe"/>
